I do miss those lesser ones held in the streets of downtown LA years back - there's something special about partying under darkened skies amongst those majestic skyscrapers.  LA Coliseum and fairground has been EDC's home for the past half decade, and the property certainly does the event justice.\n\nThe line up is always sick, and the overall event production (stages, sound, lighting, fireworks, art/show pieces, vendors, carnival rides, acts) is over the top and get progressively insane as years progress.\n\n180,000 visitors (in the 2010 EDC) can't be wrong!\n\nI love you, Insomiac.",

This past year I went on the Friday, and it was perfect. I loved partying as the sun was going down and having room to roam around.

I wish they would come back here but hey its a great excuse for a road trip. I went to EDC LA until the last year they had it here. This is how a crowd get down and real. The music is always great and when the beat drops the crowd goes wilding. \n   I love making costumes for each day. It's really my favorite part besides the music. We get to see so much creativity come out of people. Always good vibes and awesome people.\n  The last year in LA was crazy though, music was turned off in the main room for a long time, and vendors refused to sell anything until the music was back on. People were jumping from the seating area into the arena, on vendor tents. I guess they had a good reason not to hold it here anymore lol.\n   Although it's no longer in LA. EDC is still thee most awesome rave and you can experience it in Las Vegas the city that never sleeps, just like ravers! LOL \nPLUR! (^_^)",

And there's loud music. \n\n2008 was the first year Insomniac threw it here and man that was legit. Huge venue, lots of space to move around.\n\n2009 was the best year here. Still spacious, great music, vibe was still awesome. EDC 2009 definitely ranks among the top 5 EDM events I've been to.\n\n2010 was a little ridiculous. WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE. WAY TOO MANY SHENANIGANS GOING ON. and was it just me, or did it take Forever to go anywhere. \n\nSee ya'll in vegas!",

We went both days, but the first day, we got there it was like 10pm-ish? It was fun and we got to ride the bumper cars & just dance. Then the next day, we got there at like afternoon time about 6pm-ish or even earlier. It was bright & sunny. Not much excitement yet. Then as it progressed later, started to dance. By the time it was dark, it was cold. Brrr... It's always fun to see people get all dressed up in their raver gear/costumes. Cute. The one thing I wish that I/we could have done was ride more rides, but the only ride that we got to ride on was the bumper cars. :(\n\nWe got to see ATB, Kaskade, David Guetta, and I don't remember who else.",

Its amazing to act truly urself and be accepted. Theres no judgement. Insomniac puts on the best events possible and they really go above and beyond.

So careful, it is VERY easy to lose track of the people you came with which can ruin your experience there.",

        "review": "EDC 2009 was my first rave ever. I was first shocked by all the people in neon colored clothing (or lack thereof), kandi bracelets, and crazy shuffling.\n\nI love electronica, but I had no idea this was the kind of culture the music is associated with. I almost wanted to leave because my prude ass was shocked and scared.\n\nHowever, just by looking at everyone, art installations and the music all blended together, I fell in love with EDC. The energy was crazy (I didn't even roll both times I went), and it's seriously just one crazy party. Friendly people (of course), amazing light shows, awesome music, cool rides... It was really a great way to kickoff the summer.\n\nWhat I loved about EDC was the venue. It's huge! You have the coliseum and the areas surrounding it. It was crowded as hell, but it's all part of the fun. EDC always has a great line up, and the performances are just outstanding.\n\nThings I didn't like about EDC? Bathrooms; they get disgusting by the time it gets dark. Also parking is terrible ($25 is the cheapest I've seen) and traffic gets so crazy around the venue. Tip: make sure you get a legit parking spot, i.e. USC parking, unlike those shady places super close to the venue... they cost around $60 and I wouldn't consider it safe... I'm sure your car would be highly likely to get jacked.\n\nI had so much fun EDC 2009 that I went to Monster Massive, which was not as good primarily because of the venue (Just the sports arena, not the coliseum). I went to EDC 2010 and it was better than 2009. The best lineup!!! One thing I did was go on the very top of the coliseum and I saw the view from up there, which included the Downtown LA skyline. It was beautiful.\n\nOverall I highly recommend EDC. It's a great way to start off the summer and it's an awesome experience. Have fun and be safe!",

        "review": "Electric Daisy Carnival...that name means a lot if you are a raver.  Heck if you were a raver in the last decade you should know that name.  \n\nI have seen the Electric Daisy Carnival grow over the years from a smaller massive that had like 30,000 attending (at the time that was huge) to last year where they had 180,000 attending over 2 days.  If I know my facts that is the largest electronic music festival in North America.  \n\nI remember back when EDC used to be at the Orange Show in San Bernardino.  I actually like parties at the Orange Show better than the Los Angeles Coliseum but there is technically more room for people at the Coliseum so I can understand the move.  I really think that with the amount of people who attended in 2010 that they might consider moving it to another newer venue that can handle that amount of people.  \n\nWhile EDC has awesome music and great world class DJ's, what really impresses me is the production of the whole night.  It really seems like they think of every last detail when designing stages, lighting, decor and the little details.  \n\nIn fact one of my favorite raver memories was from EDC in San Bernardino when they had a helicopter fly over the party and drop bags full of actual daisies onto the crowd.  It was literally raining daisies on the Electric Daisy Carnival. \n\nI know there was some drama at this years event and I know the rave scene in general is going through a state of flux right now but hopefully the Electric Daisy Carnival will be something we can look forward to for years to come.  \n\n:0)",

I have to say I would've preferred they kept it at opening around 4pm or so and ending at 4am instead of this 2pm to 2am nonsense. My friends and I got there around 4 or 5pm-ish? The security guards are unnecessarily mean, I mean yeah I understand why they break up the entrance into female & male lines but if you're going to break up our group you can't just yell at people for waiting for their friends. Seriously? That's dumb. And WHAT THE HECCKK is going on with the bathrooms. I KNOW you guys make MORE THAN ENOUGH money from these raves to at least have a constant supply of TOILET paper. I GOTTA BRING MY OWN TOILET PAPER IN FROM HOME. LOL (it ALWAYS happens) . And who are the dummbb people clogging up the sinks with toilet paper?! seriously?! ya'll need to learn some good hygiene and stop being lazy. the trash can is right there. If I can be drunk and make it to the bathroom AND the toilet then no one is too drunk to toss a paper towel into the trash.\n\nAnyways enough about bathrooms! It was SO SO SO stupid that they close off the field access at a certain point. They should do it like how clubs do it, if people leave they let in an x amount of people in. You know? So people didn't feel like if they were trapped in and had to PEE ON THE FLOOR. YES, you nasties, I heard about the field access being a \"pee palace\"  by the end of the night. Nor would they have the problem of people climbing the fences to jump into the field and getting hurt and breaking the fences. People don't pay that absurd amount of forever increasing ticket prices just to be locked out of the field. \n\nI love these things, but theres some nasty ass people out there, so just watch out. -___- icckk. I had a lot fun, but unless Insomniac ups their game I'm not sure if I'll be back to EDC again. They need to keep that 18+ thang going on forever. It will probably clear up the area a lot more and there will be a lot more room to move and less havoc. Yes, I'm sure they make tons of money off you kids but you're are soooo doomed if you're raving at 16.. LOL",

It really is the best outdoor club experience one can have. Friday is suppose to less crowded than Saturday but the main field was closed pretty early on (before darkness) but there was still plenty of seating in the coliseum to enjoy the music. \n\nThe usual quibbles have more to do with logistic stuff: expensive food/drinks, zero cell phone reception at all, pricey lockers (going with a group? coordinate & split the locker price). Don't forget to wear comfy shoes because there is a bit of walking between the fields and you want to be able to get your dance on. \n\nThere's always something interesting to look at, occasionally a friendly unexpected hug from a stranger and eargasms to last throughout the night.",

        "review": "EDC.. Electric Daisy Carnival.. the best and most exhilarating rave of MY time??? in my opinion, it's one of my favorite raves. My favorite DJs and the theme of the flowers (I have an obsession with flowers..), the location (it WAS held at the LA Colosseum for many years until recently, ahem) being outdoors in a wide and open area.. you have to actually attend to know the feeling but I've been to EDC twice (2009 & 2010) and both times had to be the best times of my life.\n\nThere's just something about EDC that makes it stand out from the rest. Yes, it's outdoors and consists of some of the best DJs and maybe it's the weather but I'm seriously not sure how to explain this 5 star feeling in words but take my advice, go to EDC and you be the judge.\n\nImportant tip: Don't overdose on drugs and ruin it for the rest of us.\n\nSincerely, a girl who's never popped and has attended many raves strictly because I love the music. After all, isn't that what these raves are about? The music?",

EDC use to take place in San Bernardino and got moved to the LA Coliseum, it's like what the heck!? \n\nFor one the music and production is always insanely good but haaaa parking!!! HORRIBLE, let me rant before I get to all the good stuff. Don't get me wrong the event itself is awesome but man did anyone think that putting this in the middle of the city would benefit anyone? Many potential hazards, traffic, and parking issues, I understand why they did it, especially seeing how much lots were charging for parking! Anyway if you had a hard time you probably had to walk quite a while to get to the actual event.\n\nNow to the good stuff, the music was awesome as always. There were about 6 stages throughout the coliseum. The main stage was inside the coliseum and if you walked up and looked down into it, there were so many people in there that it looked like a bunch of ants, INSANELY awesome and crazy.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wSaXktuHKI\n Also there were a number of carnival rides inside the coliseum and throughout the grounds. \n\nAt all massives and outdoor festivals be prepared to be raped by the prices of food, alcohol, and mainly water. By the end of the night you'll see people laying out and see the casualties everywhere from you know what are extreme exhaustion hahaha. People that don't like super huge crowds I don't advise it or you might have a anxiety attack or something. Great place to dance and enjoy a super platform of DJs.",

It is soo crazy seeing this event reach the level that it has now out in Las Vegas, where it is now. I went the last years that it was only 1 day..and then 2 days..then when I thought it couldn't get any better, Insomniac made it 3 days long in Vegas! \nOther than the last year that EDC was in LA, EDC LA was an epic event. The last year didn't really impress me, because Deadmau5, who I was really looking forward to see, played the worst show ever! He literally came out a total of 3 times during his set and it was obvious he was playing a pre-recorded set. Other than being disappointed during his set, every other aspect (including other DJs) of the EDCs I have attended were phenomenal. EDC LA left a life-long impression on me and has hooked me as a life loyal attendee.",

We ended up parking for free next to USC, but it took a while.\n-even worse, traffic is A BITCH. it takes a hour to get from the highway ramps to EDC, and vice versa.\n-they closed the main field.\n-walking from field to field takes forever.\n\nOtherwise, it was great. So much to do...maybe too much--you can't do it all! We went on a ferris wheel as I wished but it took about an hour to get there. There were also other rides next to a small field. I actually had the best time at the smaller fields. We went to Kinetic (with Kaskade and Deadmau5) and it was hard to dance there because people would be moving across the stands all the time. Also, the sound quality wasn't all that from where we were. \n\nDrinks were okay priced ($8/small cocktail) and the food was unremarkable, in the typical carnival way.  There were actually a lot of restrooms! Nice.\n\nEDC is definitely a stimulus overload experience though, even without drugs (I don't do drugs!) Tons of awesome lights, visual effects, disco ball trees, etc. Amazing music. Costumed, young people (the girls are nearly naked actually...sucks if you have a bf with wandering eyes, haha). \n\nI gotta say though, I'm kind of glad I came too late to get into the main field after watching the videos of it. Though I noticed how NO Asians were hopping the fences...and yes, there were Asians at EDC. My experience at EDC was very peaceful. People were quite pleasant, minus some guys who cut in the ferris wheel line. I also really loved seeing all the cute furry backpacks people were wearing.\n\nAll-in-all, super fun, though I should not have worn heels! I required much piggy-backing to the car.",

Since it's so crowded, they sometimes close off the main field. oh, and they rape your ass with water prices.  wtf.  5 bucks for a bottle.  \n\nPS: do not come here if you are a prude.

I would say this is one party worth flying into town for... words can't describe seeing the tens of thousands of people dancing to the beats of the night.

Miraculous production to put this together I am sure!. Only minus - a bit chaotic getting in, but it's all good\n\nonce inside:\nWalking into the outdoor arena at night, Kinetic,  the beats, the lighting, the people, the noise, was *almost* as momentous as my first entrance into (the now old) Yankee Stadium.\n\nFavorite Sets:\nBenny Benasi and Fedde Le Grand. Swedish House Mafia also rocked it\n\nThe people. Ravers are so friendly. Giving, and Receiving.\nThe installations. Fire breathing. Really.\nThe drinks - Plenty of water and Gatorade. Alcohol, if needed.\nThe music - A-Mazing. Simply A-Mazing. 'nuff said\nThe dancing - Judgement free zone\nThe costumes - Anything, and everything. Creative expression of the mind\nCarnival games\nCarnival rides\nNew friends\nOld friends\n\nWas there a negative? I don't think so. Meeting up with friends was a miraculous accomplishment however, this just cracks me up:\n\nC:wats ur 20\nJ:circuit grounds\nJ: outside somewhere\nC: ware u r? meetup? name the place\nJ: Fwd: circuit grounds\nC:  ware is that\nJ: huge outdoor stage\nC: circle things?\nJ: yes stage is red blue big circle thongs\nC: meet @ light pole in middle of field. sign says permit parking only\nJ: is there moving camera crain in middle?\nC:dude we r in the wrong - we r in neon garden. coming 2 u now\nC: u still @ crkt grounds? large duk on stage\nC: all the way bak ther is a tree metal thing with fire in it. meet there\nJ: dancing. yes coming. after this set.\nJ: which metal\nC: 2 metal dudes. stay ther on my way\nC: u near ferris weel\nJ:near ferris wheel\nC:at ferris wheel\nJ:ok\nC:where u\nJ:at ferris wheel\nC:where\nJ:at end of line\nC:I am next too\n\nAnd this is when we realized there were 3 ferris wheels at the carnival.

I think I went on a Friday.  I've heard good things about this rave and they were all true.  Yeah it's super hippie with all the flower power things but it's all about love man!\n\nUnlike the other raves this has performers and dancers that go around giving really good shows and great kodak moments.  Also they actually have to use the Coliseum which is a really good choice on their part since it was super packed and they had to open the whole ground.\n\nSo much more entertainment then the others.  They have those awesome cube lights that everyone just seems mesmerized in, a rat hole with 3D glasses, and some fire sculpture things.  They also have carnival rides which is so much fun.\n\nI think next time I'll get a VIP pass since they get to go down to the main floor and they have 2 of the best carnival rides down there!\n\nFYI: Why the hell would you take your kid here?  I mean I know it's a carnival and all but look around you! BAD!  This is why raves were almost shut down. \n\nThere's such much things about this rave that I can go on and on about but you should really experience it yourself.  It's truly an amazing experience in your young life and I'm going to miss if when I get wrinkles. ;)",

        "review": "One of the best nights of my life. Hands down.\n\nIt was just amazing... The amount of people that gathered all for the same thing, The music pumping through your body everywhere you walked, The day turned to night, and the fireworks that illuminated the sky as you danced without a care to the blissful beats of Deadmau5 and others. It was a night that I will never forget.\n\nYes, it was not perfect, but what event of that size ever has been. I mean you don't show up to the largest rave in america and not expect there to be a shit load of people there. The numbers have been increasing every year, so why would this one be any different? If not, it would only be even bigger, since the biggest rising dance artist of the year, and the biggest name in trance are headlining...\n\nAnd as for all that crap about fence jumping and people getting hurt, and that one girl even died!.. OK, my condolences go out to that girls family, having a death in the family is hard, i cant even imagine it being your child.... BUT you cannot blame her taking drugs on an event, any more than video-games for kids shooting other kids. Its their own ignorance and apathy. As for all those people who got hurt. More than likely their own fault. Some 250 out of 180,000 people messed up, and now theres this huge dim view on raves. Cause there have been less riots and fights due to hockey, or football, or basketball, etc. right? (note: sarcasm above)\n\nMy final word/opinion: Definitely the best massive I've ever been to. Just as good, if not better than last year! Can't wait for next year!",

It is superdegenerate which makes its location in south central LA perfect!\n\nwell, im sure u all saw all the rioting videos in the news, \nif u didnt, get ur ass on youtube and search \nelectric daisy carnival fence jumping and goddam u will c some shit!  If u get confused this is what's happening: The fans r at The seats because The coliseum field floor gets closed off after so many ppl r down there, but that don't matter bcos ravers r not remaining in seats so they're goin 2 d field. Enjoy d shitty utube videos!  JK there's Som really great videos on utube of edc \n\nLA mofos are straight up crazy, geto as fuck and high as hell. I cant talk shit, i hopped fences and went thru security barriers along with all the other crazy ass ravers.  u cant expect me to rave in some seats while im rolling son! it aint happening\n\nits unfortunate of all the people that got hurt and the girl that died, but i dont buy that hype that someone slipped the girl some e, thats bullshit, E is not the date rape drug, E costs money, aint no one slipping e to no one, i even told a friend of mine that if u sneak in some E pills, u can probly make at least $20 for each pill, these fools are extasy crazy, they can never have enough.\nshit i wish i had some e, it was my first rave without E \nand i still had a monster massive blast!!! \n\nthe main stage is in The LA coliseum and The field where USC plays football is raver paradise. It is straight up like iraq warzone\nit is absolutely nuts, the ravers are apeshit high as fuk\nextasy is pouring thru their braincells and u smell kush and shwag nonstop. which is great! \n i love kush and especially when deadmau5 is destroying the colisuem main stage, The field and ravers\n\nThere r 4 other stages but NOTHING compares 2 The coliseum field not even coachella no joke \ni heard moby was great but didnt get a chance to see him, but wateva\ni liked z-trip a lot, travis n a-trak was cool, trent cantrelle had a prety sweet set as well as joaquin bamaca.  i cant remember much else i was blazing my ass off through out the event.  \n\nO, The basspod stage was crazy as Fuk !  12th planet and excision destroyed that stage. Loved It \n\nfor next year, if they allow this shit again, \nmake sure u get there early or they will close the field off.  I think they're not goin 2hav The coliseum stage anymore. Maybe they Need 2 move it 2.empire polo fields where coachella is held but these ravers r crazy they'll destroy that place.  Ah wateva\n\nall u people that raged and hopped fences, (im one of these peple) u all need to act right, i saw a video of ppl hoppin fences into the VIP cabanas , that musta been nuts!  id b soooooo pissed if i paid $2500 to get a cabana and all these crackass ravers keep jumpin into my shit.  WTF!!!!!\n\nwell, as u can tell, I HAD A BLAST!!!!  \nand fuk all that too old bullshit, go have some fun \ni doubt anyone could not have fun here.\n\njust get to the colisuem early to get to the floor, or yr only option is to hop fences and get cussed out by lil jon's stupid ass\n(by the way, wtf is he doing at EDC??????  thats a super fail)\n\nalso, im rreally impressed that i enjoyed this monster massive rave without any E,  that tells u either im a crackhead or this shit is really fukng awesome   lates!",

Both are PhDs, and Dr. Cui is also faculty at the USC Dental School.  I am a doctor at USC Keck hospital, so I appreciate having dentists with academic background and interests.  I do not understand the other reviews on here... I would recommend this office to my family and friends.",

(The Photography Company)\n\nI'm sad to say my husband and I have also been victims of Adam Brooks and his photography company.  Our wedding was June 14,2014. He was paid in full and failed to deliver our pictures, a very expensive photo album and a canvas photo we had ordered which was supposed to be present at our wedding, however they failed to get it in on time. It became impossible to get a hold of Adam after our wedding to retrieve our items. It spiraled from leaving voicemails, to the phone not working, to a very discomforting message on their website indicating \"restructuring\". Apparently not too long ago Adam was advertising under the business name \"The Photography Company\" thefotoco.com . I was very enraged to visit this link and see my wedding photo displayed as his sample work. My husband and I clearly stated in our contract that no wedding pictures were to be used by him as sample work, unless pre approved by us. \n\nNews10 just reported on how Adam has scammed dozens of newlyweds (http://www.10news.com/news/dozens-of-newlyweds-say-they-were-scammed-by-local-wedding-photographer-02022015) . \n\nWe will be joining the growing number of couples who will be seeking legal action.",

I guess you get what you pay for.\n\n\n\nFun and professional. Adam loves what he does and he's great at it. BEST prices in San Diego (there is no way you will get this kind of quality photography for less). I had to re-plan our wedding in only a months time and was delighted to meet Adam at a bridal bazar. His prices were 1/5 what I had seen through many other local photographers, and I liked the work of his that I saw as well as his personality. I was relieved that we could have everything I needed and wanted within our budget (we didn't think we could afford having more than one photographer at our event). He even offered to do a 45 minute test shoot for free so we could be sure we liked his style and could communicate together to get what we wanted! Our pics were ready in about a month, and we got EVERY SINGLE ONE on CD. It was included in our package! By not overcharging for every little thing (I worked with a photographer who charged $100+ PER FILE for digital images!) we can now order bunches of pictures for ourselves and our loved ones! Super happy with our photos and our experience :)",

        "review": "Unfortunately I must add my name to the list of reviewers who have had a bad experience with Adam Brooks.  This business is currently defunct (their website has more information) due to Adam stepping down and is likely the reason this business is erroneously listed as being in Las Vegas which it is not (it's in San Diego).  Adam Brooks has gone MIA and I, like many others listed here, have no photos to show for my money and have not heard from him since the shoot despite multiple attempts to contact.  The website is now saying they have no phone and requesting not to email.  They are dealing with financial issues (gee I wonder why) and attempting to revamp the business with the loss of Adam Brooks.  It says they are posting photo status online starting Monday 11/17.  So we will see what comes of this.  The business address that is listed at one site I found with a coupon is:  \n\n4372 W. Pt. Loma Blvd #B\nSan Diego, CA 92107 \n\nAnd the email listed at the site now (which is different) is:\nbrooksphotoservice@gmail.com\n\nMy heart goes out to others here who have had their wedding photos go missing as a result of this flaky business.",

        "review": "One word comes to mind when I think of Adam Brooks... \"Unprofessional!\" \n\nI had the exact same experience as \"Lakedra m\". We hired him to shoot our wedding last fall (October 2013). He seemed like a really nice guy when I met him but he turned out to be such a horrendous person to deal with after the wedding. He did not follow through with his timeline on when he would upload pictures to his website or provide prints (if you deny this, Adam, I will gladly upload the original timeline & emails). I had to send a few nasty emails to get a response from him (I gave him a week or 2 to respond), actually his assistant responded (different one every time), and he never once apologized for his lack of professionalism. After a few months, he finally uploaded all the pictures (unedited..wt#!@ was he doing for so long) to his website. It took a few more months to receive my prints, photo book, and video (picture collage), which I received separately and he had to replace the 8x10 pictures because he didn't review the originals before sending them so I had to tell him that my husband's head was cut off on one of the pictures.  \n\nAside from all the frustration, overall I was not completely satisfied with his work. He lacks creativity and professionalism. We took pictures at Balboa Park and I have about 3 pictures total that I like (family & friends took better poses/pictures). Adam and his assistant took the same pictures but different sides, personally I don't care for the side view I prefer the front view. Most of the ceremony and reception pictures were taken by Derek (awesome assistant), Adam didn't do anything and the few pictures he took were mediocre. The prints were nice quality but the photobook is garbage (Costco has better quality). I came out orange on all the pictures in the photo book and the video (picture collage) was standard (not impressed...can't believe I had to wait 7 months for that). \n\nOverall ladies, hire a professional and do your research on the photographer! I don't have pictures of all my guest :( I told Adam I wanted table shoots of guest and family/friends group portraits taken during reception and he didn't take them! (Adam, it's on the check off list that we reviewed before the wedding..i'll gladly upload it) It's your wedding so don't sell yourself short. You may contact me if you'd like to see his poor quality work......Adam, if you have the audacity to deny any of this, I kept every email, text message, document provided, and receipts to prove it!",

Helped us identify our face shape and eyes to help enhance our features according to face type. Taught us the basic need to know for that perfect brow and those contouring techniques to define your face type.\nShe also performed a demo where she went into detail from brows, eyeshadow, foundation, blush and contouring! You name it she pretty much cover it. \nDespite being a pretty big class she was never too busy to answer any one on one questions or assist you.  She also had a wonderful group of friends who were helping her.. The class was just about 4 hrs long and she was gracious enough to provide refreshments and snacks. .Although now I regret skipping on those chocolate cover strawberries, lol.\nOverall, I loved it and was well worth my 200 mile round trip in the pouring rain. So if your contemplating enhancing your skills or perhaps getting to know the basics I encourage you to give her a try.. she was truly amazing!",

My wedding was September 2014 and as you may have guessed, I have not received any of my wedding photos yet, just one email stating the condition of the company and the progress of photos... I checked the update website again yesterday and this is when I learnt about the chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. I did call the Bankruptcy court responsible for San Diego and while no current bankruptcy filing exist for Brooks photography, there was a bankruptcy filing back in 1993... \n\nMy original consultation and contact was with Rick Lammert, who insisted that because my wife and I got a deal that was only meant for San Diego clients, that we needed to pay the full cost upfront... Note to self, in the future whenever a professional service is due in the future tense, do not pay everything upfront!!! Adam did come and do our engagement photo shoot because Rick \"lives close to the California/Mexico border and would have to drive too far to get to Orange County\". Working with Adam was great, and we did get our engagement photos and prints which made us think further we made the right choice in photographer.\n\nAdam, along with two more photographers and a videographer did come to our wedding and based on all accounts from friends and family, they did a wonderful job and this is what got me... If Adam was really running a scam, why didn't he/Rick just take our money at the beginning and stopped responding to emails and communications right away, but actually came out to do an engagement shoot, and wedding? Both of which were extremely hot days and we were all sweating our butts off!\n\nAfter not hearing anything from them for 2 months, I was finally able to get a hold of Rick through a cell phone of his, and learnt that he has since left the company and is working for George Street Photos and Video (big company). I am contemplating sending him a nasty text or call him and threaten to include him in a lawsuit, or better yet, tell his current employer about my experience to see what he would say. As far as I know, Rick is still able to contact Adam Brooks...\n\nAnyway, if any and all couples who would like to come together for a class action (since I think combined, our claim would be too large for small claims court) lawsuit against Adam Brooks and possibly his \"accomplice\" Rick Lammert, please contact me at junk1297@gmail.com. I am at a lost currently about what to do, and wondering if bringing any lawsuits would get me and my wife anything, but anything is worth a try...",

Best of the best! He was professional, fun, thorough, and made it a top notch experience. He was on point capturing every shot we requested and he was incredibly patient with me and my husband as we were probably a little difficult to reign in given all that was going on. He came before the ceremony and took shots prior to the ceremony and stayed until we wrapped it up into the night. He came with not one but two assistants and tons of equipment to ensure we got every beautiful shot. It was only a few days ago and I haven't even seen the pictures yet but we are confident they will be amazing. The price was beyond fantastic for all the work he and his assistants did. We had a lot of amazing vendors at our wedding but EVERYONE commented that the photographers were out of this world, amazing! So happy I found Adam, and we would easily recommend him and his team to anyone needing any photography needs. You can easily see that he loves photography and takes a lot of pride in his work. Thank you Adam if anyone deserves 5 stars its you!",

I re-sent the email in hopes that she would reply, but she never did. It would have been courteous of her to at least let me know she wasn't available. Bad customer service.",

I have very little experience putting on anything more than mascara and lip gloss, and now I feel equipped to do an even better job than any cosmetics counter could (on myself, of course).  \nThe instructor presented various information on skin care, face shape, eye shape, application sequence, contouring, and brand/product tips.  She provided pen and paper to take notes, a full-color packet on everything covered, and snacks and drinks.  The best thing about it all is her ability to build an instant rapport with each of her students.  We were a diverse group with different cosmetic needs, but she effortlessly made us feel welcome and comfortable. She guided each of us to help achieve the look we desired.  You can tell that she really went out of her way to make it \"all about the client.\"  She was very genuine in wanting to help us, and she did all she could to make it fun for us  - fun snacks, festive decor, and even a raffle with awesome prizes.\nI loved it that she wasn't trying to sell us anything, and she wasn't \"pushing\" any specific product or brand.  She made it clear that we could achieve a glamorous look without having to buy expensive materials.  She even gave different suggestions of high end products along with their less expensive equivalents.\nAfter the lesson and demonstration - she allowed the class to sit and do their own make up.  I don't know many people who would open up their make up collection to a group of girls eager to dig in to and \"experiment.\" Doing that really gave me a chance to see what brushes, make up, primers, etc. that I really need to build my own makeup collection.  \nThe class was incredibly informative and a lot of fun.  It was refreshing to feel like a little girl again with a sea of makeup and a mirror in front of me and no time limit.  As we did this, she came to each one of us to help apply or guide us in choosing the right color, product, etc.\nAll in all, I walked away with a list of products for my wish list, detailed step-by-step application instructions, and fun-filled day with friends!",

It is going on 14 months and we still don't have our wedding photos!!! Legal action is being taken along with BBB repercussions. Adam dodges phone calls, emails, and cowards in person. Our wedding photography package was simple and was promised to be delivered no later than 30 days post wedding. No excuse for this behavior. I'm convinced the photos were deleted, lost, or ruined. If that is the case, he has no back bone and lacks the integrity to explain what happened. We have afforded him every opportunity to make this right, however he is in hiding. If he is the last photography company on earth (and I use the word company and photography loosely) and you have to use his services, coordinate with the independent photographers he contracts out. These independent photographers are professional and take better pictures than Adam Brooks. I would solely pay for their services independently. I wouldn't use his services if he offered for free.",

His communication was excellent in the beginning as we took our engagement pictures and wedding pictures even though I know he was very busy.  It rained on our wedding day so he had in his contract that he would give us a free photo session. This was so nice since it wasn't his fault that it rained. We had a hard time scheduling the appointment and since then his phone numbers don't work anymore, he doesn't seem to have a receptionist anymore, and he changed his email address to which he doesn't respond to either. I felt like I was having a one way conversation for 2 months! We paid extra for an upgraded album and never got that album or never got any parent albums either. I can't believe someone could do this to people on their wedding day and to not even pay their own staff.  It seems like he should have a lot of money since many people paid in full up front and have received nothing! I just messaged Thomas on here who started some legal action.  I know that there are many more people who he has scammed who haven't put anything on here. So sad, I hope that everyone can at least get their pictures and I hope he is not at any bridal bazaars trying to get more clients!  \nWhat happened???",

        "review": "Hi everyone..\nI'm so sad to read that this guy is still doing damage. My fiance and I booked him in September for or 2015 wedding. Like most of you he seemed legit and had great prices. He also threw in a free engagement session. We paid through pay pal and the link he sent us for payment was asking us for the full amount. I questioned it at first and asked him about it. He told me that I would be able to change the amount as I'm going through the process. My fiance was the one who completed the payment and he wasn't able to change the amount. A month later we tried to contact him to set up our free engagement session but could never reach him. All of his numbers were non working numbers. I immediately checked his website that had a notice saying that he was filing bankruptcy. I called pay pal and they could not refund our money because they had a time frame for refunds (I think it was only like 60/days and I had just missed it. The lady helping me out had the audacity of saying that at the end of the month they were changing that to 180 days and and at the moment there was nothing I could do) so anyway I did end up contacting my bank and spoke to the fraud department. They ended up crediting my money but gave Adam like 30 days to respond and fight it. Luckily so far it seems like he hasn't. My heart goes out to all of the couple's who had their wedding and don't have their pictures.",

        "review": "Sadly, I really did not want to write a negative review. I have had only two experiences with Ms. Tiffany. I came to her for the first time looking for an inexpensive quality braider in my local area that I could rely on. I thought I had found that until my latest experience with her. \n\nMy first appointment however worked out OK. I researched her work, contacted her, met with her, made an appointment, paid my setting fee, showed up for my appointment, she did her thing and I was out the door in 5 hrs. Although there were distractions and small set backs throughout the appointment, it was not the worst I've dealt with and to be honest stylist are people too so no big deal. She did her best to remain professional despite being obviously annoyed at times. \n\n I recently made an appointment online, wherein I text & fb messaged her the day after to confirm. Instead she did not respond to my communications, but sent me an invoice for my setting fee. I was a little put off by the lack of response, but forwarded a bill instead...but oh well, I had my answer one way or another.  I paid my PayPal invoice and purchased my hair.\n\nMs. Tiffany did contact me during the week  before my weekend appointment to ask if I could come in on a Wed. morning. I explained I make weekend appointments because I work during the week. At the same time I did ask to clarify if she would still be able to keep my appointment, she quickly responded that she would.  Again this made me wonder, but moving onto my Saturday Nov. 1st 9am appointment was my expectation. \n\nSaturday morning I make my way to Ms. Tiffany's, park and call her so she can let me in and we can get started. It went straight to voicemail. I text. No response. I call again, straight to voicemail. Come to find out she had sent me a fb message at 8:57am, before our 9:00am appointment letting me know that she was not going to be available. I don't know about anyone else but if Ms. Tiffany herself were in my place I don't think that even she would want to be cancelled on 2mins prior to her appointment, and then be blown off/straight ignored while waiting outside of the business by the business owner themselves! \n\nBut it gets better, I leave disappointed but not as mad as maybe I should have been. I did fb message her back in response that I was not interested in her offer to see my \"later\" (no time/date given by the way) and would like my setting fee refunded to me immediately thru PayPay because services were not rendered and the appointment that this fee holds was CANCELLED BY HER THE BUSINESS OWNER. \n\nI have since reached out  to her several times, thru many forms of communication, and although she has seldom responded  Ms. Tiffany has had my setting fee 13 days and counting.  \n \n\nThe quality of my braids I was happy with overall, she is a skilled stylist. By all means please check out the proof in her pictures. But after my first impression of her during my first appointment and her latest lack of accountability as a business owner that made a mistake, but is not taking responsibility for it, I am very disappointed. I will admit she did apologize at the very least. However, Ms. Tiffany's refusal to do the right thing and refund the setting fee for an appointment that was un-set/cancelled by her is not professional. I have been basically ignored and feel robbed. Where is the integrity? I have considering my experience been courteous and patient.  Any customer service based business that is responsible for a poor customer service experience goes out of their way to take responsibility for the instance, and accommodate the patron by refunding them at the very least; if not providing them a credit toward services.\n\nShe is a very lovely hard working woman, but I am very sadden to experience her reluctance to  return to me the funds that are rightfully mine, especially in light of the fact that SHE CANCELLED ON ME.\n\nI really didn't want to write this AND had hoped that, (giving her the benefit of the doubt), by the week after my appointment cancellation this should be resolved but its NOT.  I STILL don't have my funds and she has not reached out to me at all since I last contacted her.",

        "review": "I've noticed a pattern with these scam artists through reading all of these complaints against them. It seems as though they do just enough to have you believe they are a legitimate photography company, then they steal your money. If you think about it, going out to an engagement shoot for a few hours and a wedding (free food and drinks) to shoot pictures isn't that hard to do considering the fact that they'd make (steal) anywhere between $1500 to $3500. All that money for a few hours of walking around snapping pictures. \n\nI'm in the same boat as everyone else here. We booked this guy for our 4/18/15 wedding. And like most of you, we paid up front; although our payment was conducted over the phone and we had to pay in full because there were only a \"limited\" number of package deals left (advertised as a \"flash sale\"). We initially met with Rick Lammert, and we set up a date for our engagement shoot in September 2014.\nHowever, when we confirmed the photo shoot as it got closer to the date, we were told Rick was no longer with the company and Adam ended up shooting our engagement session. Up until that day, I was skeptical about Brooks Photography and was regretting paying in full up front as I normally don't do that. A few weeks after the engagement photo session, we received the link to all of our engagement photos, but received nothing else after that. That was also the last time we heard from Adam Brooks. In November, we saw the notices on his website and started coming across all of these bad reviews. All the numbers I had didn't work, and the only contact info I had was the email on his website. I expressed my concern via email, and surprisingly, I received a response (it wasn't Adam) and was reassured that my wedding was still good to go for 2015. We just recently found out about the bankruptcy. I wrote him again, but this time requesting a refund; I have yet to receive a response. I did a little digging, and this guy Adam Brooks filed for bankruptcy in 2009. I am going to pursue this until I get my money back.",

She provides great step by step make-up application as well as provides students with a great deal of product suggestions. She also recommends drug-store products which are very similar to the high end make-up. She even uses some of these products herself. She is more than willing to answer questions and give suggestions to every skin condition, face shape and type. She will give her honest opinion during the hands-on portion of the class. She will stop you and help you fix a technique by having you watch her in the mirror as she correctly demonstrates. Overall, she is an amazing make-up artist, hair stylist, and instructor. I am considering booking a one on one session with her to have her help me with my make-up application.",

I went to her house with a different type of hair she didn't like to work with, so I went back to the store and bought the hair she wanted. \n\nWhile she was doing my hair we had great conversation and watched a couple of movies. She was very professional. My hair was nice and neat. So why anniversary giving her two stars???\n\nAfter a couple of days of my hair getting twisted (Senegalese), they started to frizz up. Two in the back came and so I messaged her to let her know about two weeks after getting my hair done it was starting to look messy. She told me that she would redo the ones that were messed up. Ok, cool! We scheduled a time for me to come, but an appointment I had that same day ran long and she had bronchitis.  We rescheduled for the next week. The night before we messaged to make sure I was still good for the appointment. She told me that we should of used Marley hair.  Ok, no problem. I went to her house and no answer.  I waited an hour and messaged her. No reply. An hour after that she responded and said her doctor appointment ran late and if I could come back. I told her the only days I was available were on Tuesday's and Sundays. She replied asking if I wanted my whole head redone. I told her only the parts that were messed up. She said I needed to make another appointment through the website. I asked her why if she was just redoing the ones that were unraveling. I also told her I wasn't paying her to redo my hair when I had them in for three weeks and they looked like I had them in for 3 months. I never received an answer.\n\nI really didn't want to write a negative review but this is what happened to me.",

I am now forced to fly to San Diego to proceed with small claims court to recover my money back since apparently I will never receive any photographs or an update.

        "review": "From my experience, Brooks Photo is not a very legitimate business.  We encountered their service while at a wedding.  The Photo Booth guy had an outdoor set up that was pitch dark.  He didn't bring lights or any background.  Instead, we just stood in the dark with a camera pointed at us.  He didn't have very many props either.  It was really sad and it consisted for probably less than 5 items. We didn't get any prints or information on where we could download copies of the photo.  They explained that their printer was \"BROKEN.\" From reading the other yelp reviews, this appears to be a problem that occurs frequently.   You're a Photo Booth company, this is your bread and butter.  Shouldn't your equipment be checked beforehand? Instead of taking home individual photos, EVERYONE GOT NOTHING - ZELCH.  The guy also packed up and left early before the wedding ended, which was not part of their contract.",

The waving grasses complement beautifully the dragon fly decorative corner tiles (to accommodate which Danny made perfect cuts in the frame--without complaint).  It has transformed our front room! On the administrative side:  phone calls and emails were initiated or promptly returned by nice people. A sample frame was sent so we could test the sizing against our uneven tiles.  We didn't pay until we approved the final product--and it cost less than we had dared to hope. Danny Vice is a remarkably skilled craftsman:  we should have done this years ago!",

I feel like I hit the jackpot in finding Danny. The doors are gorgeous and feel like they will last forever, even with lots of daily use.  Thank you!",

This hazardous handle sported incredible amounts of organic build-up (aka \"gunk\"), and missed a couple necessary divots. I wasn't really sure what could be salvaged from this original handle, but sought out a solution because the knife had sentimental value to my family. \n\nAfter consulting numerous knife sharpening and repair services to no avail, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mike at Finest-Edge Precision not only offered to see how he could help, but grasped the value and personal sentiment this knife presented to my family. Most repair services I called said that they couldn't work on handles, or asked upwards of $100 for their services to restore and repair the handle alone. \n\nI conveniently dropped it off with Mike and Liana in Menlo Park, and picked up the knife a couple weeks later at the Saratoga farmer's market (West Valley College). Mike had not only repaired and sharpened the knife blade, but also completely restored the original handle into excellent working condition! He cleaning out all the gunk, adding some new divots, and restored the original wood with some additional touch-up and finishing.\n\nI'm so thankful that Finest-Edge Precision took on this project and helped restore this knife for a reasonable and fair price. I understand that most knife sharpening services focus only on blade repair and services, especially since it's more profitable and less time consuming than handle repair. That said, Mike, Liana and their company, Finest-Edge Precision, showed me that their focus is on holistic knife repair (handle and all), as well as providing the best possible service and support for all their customers.  \n\nFinest-Edge Precision, you guys have earned my respect and my business for a long-time coming. Thanks again for your help, and God bless!",

        "review": "I have several knives that I typically use, but I had ruined a Santoku style knife when I got lazy and used it to chop some chicken bone for broth and \"dented\" it in several locations and a chef's knife that I had abused for the past 25+ years and it had what appeared to be \"waves\" on the edge.  Eventually, my chef's knife couldn't even cut a tomato properly, so I thought it was time to see if it could be repaired and sharpened.  \n     I occasionally go to the Saratoga Farmer's Market and remembered noticing Mike's truck in the corner, so I thought I'd email him and see if anything could be done.  Given my photos weren't the best, he did give me a ballpark cost but mentioned that he would have to see my knives to determine the full extent of damage I had done to my knives, which is an absolutely fair comment.\n     The following weekend, I brought my damaged knives + another chef's knife, for sharpening only, to the Saratoga Farmer's Market where Mike and Liana told me my knives were completely repairable and it would only take about 20 minutes.  \n     Not only was I very happy that they could repair my knives, they did it at a very reasonable price and in a very reasonable amount of time!  After my knives were repaired and sharpened, I couldn't tell where I had damaged the edges.  As soon as I got home, I gave it the paper test, where you hold a piece of paper and slice a sliver off... it passed with flying colors!\n     I would absolutely bring my knives back to Mike and Liana in the future!",

The wait is never too long.  I drop off my knives and then I shop at the farmer's market and by the time I'm finished buying my produce, my knives are done!  His pricing is reasonable--it was less the $14 to sharpen a Chinese cleaver. My Japanese knife (5\") plus a chef's knife (7\") was under about  $10...that is a great price for 2 knives!! bring all my knives to him.  \n\nI gave him old pizza cutter I found cleaning my mom's kitchen.  It was dull and hasn't been used in over 25 years.  He gladly sharpened it and, at no charge.  What a great guy! \n\nI would definitely bring your knives, scissors, shears, etc. to him for sharpening.",

Tami came to my home totally prepared with a state of the art spray tan machine, fan, nose plugs, hair cover, barrier cream, and a prep solution, the works. She has amazing products, all organic. She custom mixes your color and you can add shimmer if you like. The tan looked very natural, not orange or \"too\" tan.  It was so natural I was worried it wouldn't last but 6 days later I still look pretty tan. It has faded naturally without getting blotchy or pealing. The bonus is not having to get a babysitter to go get a tan.  I highly recommend Tami at Sunspray!",

        "review": "My first session for QHHT was with Jaclyn. I did not know what to expect and as like most people I have a preconceived notion of hypnosis. After Jaclyn discussed my questions and thoughts we began. She then put me in to a dream like state and the information began to flow. Let me also give some background on myself so that you can better understand me. I have been on opioid and other pain medication for over 8 years. I have other symptoms as well that go along with the chronic pain and have not been able to work full time during this span. Needless to say I have tried many doctors of both western and non western approach. My main focus of the session was getting to the root of my pain problem and getting off of the pain medication.\n\nJaclyn was able to make the session flow and ask the right questions to help me move forward. I was impressed by her ability to make me relax and keep moving when we hit any stumbling blocks. After the session I didn't feel any different however in the next few days things started to change. I did have healing crisis and I knew then my body was reacting to the  QHHT session. I feel it is important to mention that going over the session in a week or two is beneficial to getting the maximum results. New information can come to light that makes a difference after you have had time to absorb the experience.\n\nSeveral months have gone by now since I write this and I am not sure if was the session or the with drawls from the opioid or both but things were a little rough for a while. I am now completely off of the opioid and my body is still healing. I have no doubt in the power of QHHT and even had my session muscle tested as to the effect. I don't know what the limitations are of a QHHT session however for me I know it got me the results I have been chasing for almost a decade.",

I had no idea what I was getting into and she did a great job of reassuring me and giving me the 411 on what was going to be happening and what to expect.  Super positive and she matched my excited happy energy, which is important going into such interesting waters as a newbie.  Would definitely refer and return to her again if I needed another session!  Parking was a breeze, and free, which is important in Santa Monica! Thanks so much :D",

        "review": "Working with Jaclyn is incredibly powerful. I came to see her to do a past-life regression session - my first. I was so curious about my other life times and to understand what other karmic lessons or ties that could benefit me through my healing work in this lifetime to truly dissolve and free myself from old wounds, old lessons, old stories.\n\nJaclyn has a very relaxing, soothing space to work in. She brings an energy that allowed me to be at ease, feeling so safe, warm, comforted. We talked first about my intention for the session and any questions I had that I hoped to have answered from my other lifetimes and from my higher self.\n\nShe led me through an exquisite guided visualization to get into the state of hypnosis. I didn't fall under that time, meaning I never felt like I left the room and couldn't remember the messages. But even if I had, we recorded the session so I could capture all of it. And Jaclyn taught me that with each re-listen of the recording is like having a whole new healing session on deeper and deeper levels.\n\nA lot of answers, guidance, information and beautiful energy came out of my journey with Jaclyn. The most beautiful lesson was another confirmation of how powerful I am and how much I have access to in order to live into and be my highest good. I left knowing, once again, the only moment is now and when I yearn for the past or reach into the future I'm not wholly in touch with my highest self and that divine communication where all the answers, guidance, fearless living lies. I felt such a deep calm and sense of relaxation. And I felt I was floating for days. \n\nJaclyn provided me the guidance, process, and held so much space for me to reach such a deep exploration. I highly recommend her for healing work, hypnosis, self-exploration, pain relief, healing this lifetime so that your family lineage going backwards and forwards can be cleansed and free from limiting beliefs and old ways of operating that keep you small. Expand, live into your highest purpose. Go see Jaclyn.",

He said that they did some work for him a couple of months back and he was very happy.\n\nJack called them and they came in early the next morning.

I regularly see a chiropractor, acupuncturist and massage therapist, as well, so I'm all for self-care as a way of life. There wasn't anything in particular that was bothering me...just general aches and pains. So, I made an appointment with David at the suggestion of a trusted friend, and felt completely at ease from the moment I met him. He thoroughly explained the practice and importance of MFR to me before he got started. And then once he got started, all I can say is wow! I felt the tension release time and time again in areas I wasn't consciously aware I was carrying it. I left feeling like I was on Cloud-9 and will certainly be back as part of my regular routine.",

First of all-we had called them 3 times and after setting up appointments-3 times they never called or showed up--the fourth time they said they would be at our home between 12-3 and never showed up until 5:30. The guy didn't even drive a company truck or dress professionally. He even had to use our ladder since he didn't have one:( And all he did was to spray canned air into the termite holes and covered them with putty!! And a week later we have new termite trails! We have filed a complaint with the BBB so hopefully we will get our money back-please don't ever use Core Pest Solutions!!",

David has this gift! I have had chronic neck & shoulder pain and have sought out his help many times over the years to get me back in the game of life. I need structural work, yes I love a good massage but I know that for me the results are in the deeper kind of work that David has specialized in.\nMy experience in working w David Goldeen has been an inspiring journey, I'm grateful for his passion, his continuous training and expansion of his work, his skill set and for his dedication in caring for his clients and friends.

Totally understable, they have other clients to attend to. Also, they said if you see a groupon deal online to just call them directly and they'll honor the discount.

Melody also does a timeline to make sure she stays on schedule and stays in contact with all your vendors. I honestly had such a relaxing wedding thanks to my wedding coordinator. \nThank you so much Melody for making my big day so special!",

She has been so helpful in every step of the way. She has given us the best referrals for photographer, DJ, florist, etc. She even went with me to go wedding dress shopping! I was having a difficult time finding a location with dresses I liked and she took the time to go with me to stores she knew would have a great selection. She sets up our appointments for venues, florists, photographers, and everything else we need to get done. That is extremely helpful because my fianc and I both have full time jobs so we don't have too much time to do all that ourselves. Thanks to Melody, planning a wedding has been stress free.",

        "review": "I was eager to book with Rebecca, based on her website and the Yelp reviews.  I live two hours away and realized there would be a factor in me coming to her for a headshot, but her background still seemed to make it worth while.  When my daughter came down with mono, she was great with the cancellation. HOWEVER, here are the drawbacks: 1) The Living Social offer states she is willing to travel 20 miles.  She would not come 20 miles closer to me, which would have reduced my commute time. 2) She would only do headshots between 9 -10 in the morning and 5-6 in the evening, due to lighting.  She uses outdoors, not studio, so this, again, put me with an issue to get my make-up and hair done in the early morning so I could hit the road by 6:30 a.m.(not possible) or face afternoon commute.  Because I'm older, I look tired by 5 at night with a 2+ hour commute.  My problem? YES. But a 1 O'clock shoot time in a studio with soft focus works great.  To mitigate the problem, I asked if she had a hair and make up person in the area she works with. She said to come \"natural\".  I'm old...natural doesn't work with \"old\" and a head shot. :)  3)  The Living Social offer gives 2 prints.  After buying it, I found out that you cannot reproduce or use the prints in any digital format.  What good are headshots if you cannot reproduce them for distribution or use them in your social media?  This is obviously a come on to get you to \"buy up\".  4) Another issue of going through Living Social, you do not get the true value posted.  Rebecca's website says she meets with you to discuss the shoot and clothing options.  She flat out told me that she doesn't make enough from the vouchers to do anything other than take the pictures and print them.  No consultation.  This was a big reason why I bought her package, because I wanted expert advice.  5) Good luck finding a date and time that works.  She is slow to respond to emails and when I had dates available, she didn't. (My schedule is pretty wide open.) I finally had to get a refund.  The reason for 2 stars versus 1 is because she was good on the time I had to cancel for my daughter's illness.  I have worked in the L.A. area and have experienced much better professionalism and more honesty in what the end result would be with people who have studios to control the lighting.  Outdoor shooting is unpredictable.  So is Rebecca Vinacour Photography.",

I was 6 minutes late and because the lady assumed no one was going to show up she decided to go get herself food and didn't  want to stop eating or put it away for later to take me!! Oh yeah and if I renscheduled I would have to pay 35 more bucks. Then she had the nerve to tell me even if I don't want to reschedule my facial I need to grow out my eyebrows and come back because they have no shape. How nice of her to give me her random option on my look! They were rude, not helpful and don't appreciate a good customer.",

        "review": "Found Rebecca through a LivingSocial deal when I was trying to organize a family shoot with my in laws. My husband and I live in Tucson, while the rest of the fam lives up in Phoenix. Rebecca was very responsive via email - which was especially nice since a face to face was not really an option - and we were able to communicate what we wanted out of the shoot, discussed what to wears, and decided on a time and a place. My family lives within the allotted distance, so that was no problem for us. Our shoot was a large one with 10 of us, and Rebecca pulled it off brilliantly. Not only was she able to capture the large group within our hour shoot, she also snapped up photos of each individual family. The end result was a beautiful family photo that we were able to gift our parents, as well as ourselves. It was a pleasure working with Rebecca, truly. Thank you, Rebecca!",

Yeah that playing over the pseudo Native American easy listening music creates a really non-relaxing environment \n\nSo I left.  \n\nAbout 20 minutes after leaving \n(which leads e to believe they waited an hour before even returning to the room to get me) I get a call from Sabai. Still pretty irritated that they wasted that much of my time I don't answer the phone.\n\nI listened to the message later and they called me \"Karina\"  \nExcuse me?\n\nHow does \"iana\"  sound like \"Karina\"  Better yet, how does it look like \"iana\" because I wrote my name down on their silly fill out form.\n\nThey may be a good spa, or they may be as bad as they are rude. I will never know because I will never go back there. \n\nI say stay away",

Not worth it..there are many more professionals in the area. My loss of $40, but a lesson learnt.",

        "review": "EEEEK GADS..............This place was terrible. I wish I had paid more attention to LanaC's review before I bought the Groupon for a couple's massage for this place. It's pretty rare to see a Groupon for a massage place in Morgan Hill, so I thought I'd jump at the opportunity. \n\nI agree, the customer service was terrible. I first tried to make a weekend appt but was told they were too busy and a weekday was better. .........So I made a weekday appt. I took the day off as I thought it would be a nice spa day.    When we arrived, the owner advised she wouldn't be able to take care of us that day because her therapist had car trouble. She said she had tried to call but couldn't reach me. I'm not sure how that happened, because I wasn't  asked for my phone number when I arrived. I was finally able to rescehdule the appt for a weekend. Again, when we went in, we were told that someone had tried to call us..........this time, to confirm the appt. \n\nI'm not sure what kind of business is next door, maybe a karate studio or something like tht. All I can say is, the walls are thin and you can hear lots of noise. Not a very peaceful environment. The massage was terrible - I was in pain - when I commented that the massage was painful, she didn't even lighten up. Also there was no flow. And Forget the feet, those weren't even touched!!!!  \n\nThe facialist talked me into getting my eyebrows waxed - she let out a giant \"oops\" when part of my skin on my eyelid was ripped off.  I took pictures of my eyelid and I hope there is no scarring.............\n\nI'm not really sure how this place got so many great reviews...............",

She was very adept at telling me what she was doing and why, as well as the type of products she used.  Her demeanor is so pleasant and I even fell asleep at points because I was so relaxed!  She is very sure of herself and the way in which she massaged my neck and face felt luxurious. \n\nAfterwards, my face felt magnificent!  So smooth and soft.  I will be going back to Ms. Leny very soon.  Highly recommended!",

        "review": "Melted. Butter. Best massage of my life! But I'll get to that.\n\nMy appointment today was for 1pm, and I got there right as Veronika, my massage therapist, was arriving. So we were the only ones there! It's a beautiful spa, very peaceful. I filled out the new patient form while she was getting everything ready. I indicated what parts of my body needed to be focused on, and then when we were in the room we discussed it together. She was very thorough in her questioning regarding the tension I was feeling and my pressure preference. \n\nI told her I liked medium pressure, not so intense that it hurts and not so light that I'm being tickled. Let's face it, I can get tickled at home by my boyfriend for free. She really listened to me and throughout the entire massage I felt like I was getting exactly the right amount of pressure and she was focusing on all the right spots. Not to mention the massage oil she used smelled sooo lovely! The one-hour signature massage I got came with a foot exfoliation, which was very nice.\n\nAfter the (amazing) massage she told me things she noticed about my body that I didn't even know! It's so cool that she cares enough about what she does to pay that much attention and give that level of service. (It was also nice that she didn't talk too much during the massage, but she did ask occasionally how I was feeling and if the pressure was okay. Much appreciated!)\n\nI will definitely be a regular client of Veronika's, and hopefully I'll try some of the other services they offer at Sabai, like the facials. I'm not kidding when I say this was the best massage of my life! I'm used to going to day spas that are pretty, but don't have much to show for it in terms of results. Sabai is better than that, they are specialists and they will help you feel so much better.\n\nThe spa is super easy to find, in the Candy Park Business Center on Monterey St. (Suite E). I can't wait to go back! :D",

Melody is absolutely AMAZING in everything that she does. Had it not been for her, my wedding would have been a disaster! But instead, I had the most amazing day with no hiccups; she took care of it ALL. Melody met with my husband and I weeks before our wedding to get all of the details, confirmed payment/delivery/pickup with all of my vendors weeks in advance, was at our venue on the day of bright and early making sure everyone was on time and that all things were in order, tied any loose ends on the day of that would have driven me crazy, was dressed super cute and professional for the event and even jumped in to help serve and pick up after my guests during dinner. I literally had to do NOTHING on my wedding day other than enjoy my day! I really don't know what I would have done without her. Highly highly HIGHLY recommend Melody for any event!",

I usually don't buy Groupons for services for fear of not receiving better service because of being a Groupon client. I was also afraid of not being able to book an appointment because of large number of clients who bought the Groupon. I was also hoping it was not a hole in the wall either. \n\nI was grateful that I was wrong about all my preconceived notions! Sabai is absolutely gorgeous as well as relaxing. From the decor to the scented candles,  its definitely top notch.  Very clean too!\n\nThe Aesthetician, Grace, was absolutely amazing and very warm and friendly.  Also very experienced in her techniques and recommendations.  The Diamond tipped micro head she uses did a great job getting rid of my dead skin revealing fresh new skin underneath.  After the micro,  she put on a mask to both brighten and moisturize my skin. While mask was on, she did neck and shoulder massage which was amazing.  I walked out with radiant , soft, glowing skin.  \n\nMicroderm is a great compliment to my sublative treatment I get with Dr. Le in San Jose.  Sublative works to build collagen from the inside skin layers out while Microderm reveals fresh skin from outer layers of my skin. Works great together. I am excited to get my third treatment in 3 weeks. Thank you, Grace!",

It was a fantastic experience and a real value. I will definitely be back!",

Well, I was wrong. It was 11:50am and still no technician, so I call. They then tell me that their technician was running late and it would now be between 2-5pm!! I had already postponed all of my errands for today since it's my day off. I was upset because if I wouldn't have called I would have been here till 5pm waiting! The guy on the phone was not even apologetic, so I got upset and instead of offering me another technician or someone will come to my home as soon as possible, it was more of the attitude of \"you should be glad someone is coming out to your home\". When they offered someone can come by tomorrow, I said cancel my appointment and that I will never do business with this company again. Then he hung up on me when I asked for the true name of their business! I just went by the sticker on the garage opener that came with this home we  bought. This mishap was a blessing in disguise now that I'm seeing all the other reviews, which are not good!!! STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS!!",

        "review": "Stopped in over a week before Halloween since an ordered costume was going to not be in for my daughter's school's party, despite being ordered early enough. The store was chaotic and messy. Employees were standing around talking to one another and not helping customers, which there were plenty of parents and children looking for costumes. I asked a young female embloyee next to me for a specific costume, interrupting her conversation with another employee.  She looked at me, hesitated as if it were a bother, but finally called back for my costume.  Without further instruction, she turned and walked away, speaking to another female employee. I asked another parent, who told me to walk around back. I found a table near a set of double doors in the back of the store. It was strewn with bagged costumes and no one there to instruct or ensure the costumes were correct. I found the costume I asked for, in the size I requested, and checked out. It was the most pleasant employee interaction of the excursion. I got home, only to find that part of the costume was missing (wand). After my experience there, I wouldn't recommend it, nor did I return and deal with the hassle.  \n\nFor reference, wand was to come with costume: http://www.partycity.com/product/girls+ballerina+bee+costume.do?navSet=280529",

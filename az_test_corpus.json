Change the yelp ad. You guys are closed Sunday! I drove all the way out to get my favorite food to find you are closed.... Common now!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the food is very fresh and incredibly delicious. I had the falafel plate, which included not only 6 falafel patties, but a salad and a generous helping of hummus and pita. Everything was prepared to order (not ahead of time) and spiced to perfection. The staff were very friendly, to boot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was great and the variety on menu good. All food prepared up front visible to the customer which I like. The food was great, be prepared to leave full.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place! Great tabouleh, falafel and kibbeh. Decor is a little antiseptic so best bet is takeout. Family run business which is great. We have generally went to Sabas but after trying Kabob house we haven't been back to Sabas once.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is AMAZING and DELICIOUS!!!! The food is authentic and made to order. I would come here everyday if I lived closer. Don't miss this tasty and satisfying new restaurant!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy new favorite Mediterranean food restaurant! Great food at a great price. Wonderful customer service. The grape leaves and gyro are amazing\n\n\n\n\n\nI am always SUPER excited when an authentic ethnic eatery pops up in my hood. And Kabab House definitely did not disappoint!\n\nIt is right by our house and after passing it countless times we finally decided to pick up some takeout for a late lunch.\n\nI ordered the falafel pita and my husband had the chicken schwarma pita. My husband picked it up and said the family that ran the place is so nice. The guy at the counter even gave my husband a free soda because he felt bad about the short wait for food.\n\nHe brought our food home and we were surprised when we opened our food boxes with the enormous serving of french fries that came with the pitas. They were piping hot and sprinkled with a unique seasoning. We were only able to eat about a third of the fries, since our pitas were huge as well. My falafel pita was awesome. Very flavorful. My husband loved his chicken pita and said the seasonings were perfect. They gave us sides of sriracha. That is a restaurant after my own heart.\n\nI highly recommend Kabab House. Lots of delicious food for a reasonable price served by a very nice family.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was in the Kabab House for the first time on Sunday night and I simply loved it. Great family owned business that had fresh food & a great feel to it. I'll be going back and I would recommend it to anyone. Great experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nfantastic to have a true Mediterranean restaurant where everything is fresh and tasty. try the yogurt drink...perfect!  chicken Sharwma was superb. my new favorite local restaurant\n\n\n\n\n\nThis probably one of the better Middle Eastern restaurants I've eaten at in Northern Phoenix and they are a very nice family run restaurant. The food is great, the prices are very good and it's very fast ... you can't beat that!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Middle Eastern food I've had in Phoenix!  I tried this for the first time last night.  I asked the gentlemen if they were family recipes and he said of course.  I will say, I am incredibly picky about my falafel.  I try it everywhere and outside of Saba's, am consistently disspointed, no matter how good the other dishes may be.  When I tried this falafel, I knew I had found a place for me!  Additionally, the meat was so tender and delicious!  The kabob mix, with chicken, beef and kefta was amazing!  The food is incredibly fresh an excellent quality.  I will agree that the hummus is not as flavorful as some I had, but it was still very fresh.  Since it's a family recipe, I just thought maybe their family didn't like as strong of a flavor to it?  Plus I find most people to think hummus is supposed to taste like the stuff from the market or Trader Joes.  That's not real hummus.\n\n It was a bit slow in preparation, but they haven't been in business that long, and making everything fresh does take more time.  It's not a nice, sit down dining environment.  Fine for a lunch or whatever, but just don't want anyone to be disspointed if you're doing here for a nice dinner, but the food cannot be beat, so perfect for takeout or a very casual dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I was super excited when a new middle eastern restaurant opened up within walking distance. Unfortunately, I'm left pretty disappointed.\n\nTo the staff's credit they were incredibly polite and the service was great. Unfortunately the food was simply bland, especially the hummus. I'm pretty sure they just ground up some chickpeas and called it a day.  Also the food took way longer than it should have.  The cook must be pretty new to this whole restaurant thing because they only cooked one meal at a time. I had to watch them cook and serve the 2 other people who arrived before me one by one in order.  Given that pretty much everything served here is either already prepared or grilled, they should be able to prepare multiple orders at once.\n\nI'll try them again in a couple months just to be fair, so I hope some garlic and spices finds it way in to their food.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur new favorite resturant for a weekday date night! We werent sure what to expect at first when walked in. Though we were happily surprised by both the great food and kindness of the employees! We ordered the Gyro plate and the Kabab Koobideh plate. They both came with a generous portion of rice and a wonderful half salad and at a decent price! It left us full but not overly stuffed. We'll definitely be back with friends and look forward to trying more of the unquie menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery Cool Mom and Pop restaurant serving some delicious and very affordable middle eastern food. You can dine inside their cozy restaurant or have them fix you up for some tasty take out.\n\nBelieve or not we used to live right behind this restaurant before they built the SR51. Sure wish they were here back then. We could have easily walked right up or taken our bikes and had one of those stimulating Green Earth experiences.\n\nCame in here the first time and went with the standard Gyro combo with fries and a drink. Caught an eye of the Baklava sitting nearby and had to also get one of those bad boys. Food was very tasty and I made sure to bring the wife back for a return visit.\n\nThe menu is pretty good sized and has all the popular favorites that you can imagine. Gyros, Kababs, Shawarmas, Falafel, Hummus and then some. I also really like the take out menu. It is nicely done and has several pictures of all the different items. Nice!\n\nThe owners are both super friendly and excited when you arrive. We even talked baklava recipes for a moment while we were settling up. They make theirs the same way we do using pistachios and a touch of cardamom and a hint of rose water in the syrup.\n\nRight next to the large movie theater in the adjacent Rad Shack parking lot. See you there next time. KEEP IT LOCAL WHEN CAN!\n\n4 STARS\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper friendly. Family owned. Very clean and the chicken kabaab and gyro are the best!\n\n\n\n\n\nThese guys are great. \n\nExtremely friendly and nice service. Food is perfect, I wish they would dim their lights and make more cosy atmosphere. The food sure deserves it. \n\nAnyway, this restaurant well deserves full five stars. \n\nFood is great. \nService is careful, accommodating and friendly. \n\nEveryone should try it out\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered takeout from the place and the food was great. We got the gyro salad, a side of falafel and also the gyro plate! Definitely will be coming back for more! Have been wanting to find a good mom and pops Mediterranean place nearby and this is it! Decent prices for a good amounts of food!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a wonderful surprise, this restaurant was. This is a family owned restaurant and they are all so nice and welcoming. I had the kafta plate which was more than enough food. They do a special trick with the rice which makes it taste like no other. You will have to give it a try.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious. The salad is outstanding. The kebobs were outstanding. The humus is bland, bit well made. The iced tea is terrific. The staff are friendly. The prices are reasonable and the servings large. I had to try the beef egg roll; quite different and fun. We will definitely return.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Food! Good Service! Very friendly family owned business. I'll be back many times! I love the food. The chicken, the bread, rice, salad. Everything is great. Very fresh, quick service and wonderful.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is FANTASTIC! Very generous portions for the amount of money your meal costs. Get the gyros!  So delicious. Everything is made fresh to order. Their hummus with the ground beef was very good. This place, while not fancy, definitely is comparable to The Persian Room at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nI saw a sign for this place on our way to the movies this weekend. We stopped by for lunch after our movie.\n\nPlace is small and so so. Service was really good.\nWe had the humus with meat (great idea), hubby had a gyro sandwich (pita wrap) and he loved it. Fries were good too, tasty and crunchy.\n\nI had ordered a cubideh sandwich (wrap) but ended up just eating the humus, and taking the wrap home.\n\nHubby thought humus was kind of bland, I thought it was OK.  The meat was like hamburger meat but with herbs and spices, I liked it very much. The portion was reasonable (~$8, it is an appetizer).\n\nWe want to come back to try the grape leaves, the baba ganoush, and the tabouleh.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food, and great prices.  The family and staff are informative and kind.  The food was very fresh (I watched the lady make my foule and I watched the guy make everything else right in front of me).  \n\nAs a caveat, I don't think I would classify this food as \"Mediterranean\" or \"Greek.\"  I would call their food Middle Eastern and Arab, which is what I expected.  Regardless, it was good.  I think Yelp controls the classification.", "useful": 0.6666666666666666, "cool": 0.3333333333333333, "funny": 0.16666666666666666, "date": "2013-12-05 03:09:45"}, "1": {"business_id": "-01XupAWZEXbdNbxNg5mEg", "business_name": "18 Degrees", "address": "9375 E Bell Rd", "attributes": "{'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Music': \"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': True, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}\", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': \"u'casual'\", 'GoodForMeal': \"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}\", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': \"u'loud'\", 'HasTV': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': \"'free'\", 'Caters': 'False', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Ambience': \"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}\", 'Alcohol': \"u'full_bar'\", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True'}", "categories": "None", "city": "Scottsdale", "hours": "{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '7:0-1:0', 'Wednesday': '7:0-1:0', 'Thursday': '7:0-1:0', 'Friday': '7:0-1:0', 'Saturday': '7:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '7:0-22:0'}", "postal_code": "85260", "review_count": 99, "stars": 3.0, "state": "AZ", "review": "The location is great. Fresh brew iced tea would be welcome. The menu is fine, but I think that they could review what is on it and see what could be tweaked, improved or refined.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was at the rink scouting all day and was probably the last customer of the night. Hadnt eaten all day and ordered a cheesesteak at 9:40. Well they bring it out and the sandwich is smashed upside down on the plate. Real nice. A big F U from the cook right. The waitress did take it off the check which was nice. I would never ever come back after getting treated like that. Was such an obvious f u. Nice way to end my day.\n\n\n\n\n\nI used Local Flavor voucher $10 for $20.  As another reviewer mentioned, when I walked in, no one greeted me.  I stood there at the entrance looking at the menu for about 15 min, still no one greeted me or acknowledged me, tho I was looking at each employee that went by, as if to say \"hey, here I am\", but they didn't  notice.  So I took the menu I found at the bar, and found a table and seated myself.\n\nThe flat iron steak I had a year ago, was no longer on the menu.  A server came within 1 minute.  I told her I was ready to order (after all I looked at that menu, while waiting to be seated, for 15 min).  When I asked her if the salmon was wild or farmed, she sorta winced and said \"It's frozen\".   When I asked her if the fish and chips was already battered and they pick ready-made pieces out of a box, and then fry, she said \"That's frozen too, but it is hand-battered the night before, then frozen\".  Weird.  She said it was pretty decent.  The description said it was a light beer batter.  It costs $13, plus she said the onion soup was good, with real cheese $7, so that completes my $20.   My server, Adriana, asks me if I want my soup now, before the entre, and I yes, I am really hungry!  \n\nWe settle on water with lemon wedge, because I told Adriana I am diabetic, don't want any caffeine, or pop.  \n\nThe service was REALLY FAST!  But as soon as someone brings my onion soup, the fish comes right away too.  I look at each, wondering which to eat first, cos both are hot, and both will get cold at same time.  Melted cheese on onion soup is beckoning EAT ME NOW before cheese gets hard, and hot fried fish is hollering EAT ME NOW, before I get cold!  \n\nI eat the fried fish at same time as trying to gobble up the soup.  Soup is REALLY GOOD, very sweet, tho, I wonder if they put sugar in there, or is it just the sweet onions.  The swiss cheese was put on a piece of toast (crouton) and then melted, then both put onto the soup.  Much of the cheese was melted on the outside of the bowl, as well.  \n\nI was VERY HAPPY with the 3 pieces of fish.  The batter was indeed very light and very crispy, inside HOT!  I had to ask for some malt vinegar, which made it even better!  I substituted the fries (diabetic don't need white carbs) for the Caesar salad.  Salad was kinda boring, bland, so I squeezed lemon juice on it, which really livened it up.  Cole slaw was really good !  \n\nServer Adriana came TWICE to ask me if everything was OK.  She asked me if I needed a take out box, when I was half way thru my dinner, but I said I was really hungry and I think I will be finishing the whole thing.  And I did.  \n\nMy server was VERY attentive, genuinely friendly, helpful, and interested in my welfare (not distracted), and I give her A+.  If the management has more Adrianas, this place wouldn't get such bad reviews.\n\nI am giving it 4 stars because no one ever greeted me and I had to seat myself.  This also happened when I came here a year ago.  That server was not attentive at all.  My flat iron steak I had then, was really gamey, tho I like gamey beef, I wondered if it was American beef, as it tasted like it came from another country, South America.  So if it weren't for my previous experience with mediocre server, and if staff \"noticed me\" when I came in both times, I'd give 18 degrees a needed 5 stars.  Apparently people like it here, maybe cos it was Sat night, and not weeknight.  But every seat was taken, and different people asked for my three vacant chairs (I ate alone), and as soon as I stood up to leave, people were already sitting down at my table, before someone could clean it.  The parking lot outside was amazingly full, tho not that many people at the Ice Den.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat hockey bar.  You can see the ice arena from your seats.  Carries both Molson and Labatt blue.  Food is bar food.  Service is prompt!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was very mediocre, VERY!\nThe food was blah and the place was not bustling.  Eventually had to go track down the waitress and get our tab...\nGlad to see others had a better time.........\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food and drinks! The service was amazing from the beginning and it's definitely the place to be for Friday night happy hour. The renovations are an added bonus to the great service and experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery spacious inside with large booths. One side of the restaurant had clear windows looking into the Ice Den. They have entry from the parking lot and from Ice Den. The service was prompt and friendly. The restrooms were clean.\nThe food is hit or miss. We ordered turkey avocado sandwich which was quite tasty. The bread was nicely toasted and had very generous portion of turkey cold cut in it. It also came with French fries which was nice. \nAlso had the philly steak sandwich. The meat was a bit dry and it didn't really have much flavor but It came with generous serving of French fries. \nIf I was here for Ice Den, I would consider eating here because it is convenient. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. My friend had Groupon, so we didn't pay full price so it was a plus.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe dine here often. My husband is a wings man and we meet friends and order their pitcher and wings deal. Massive plate of wings and a pitcher of beer on tap, we usually go kilt lifter. The wings are hands down the best Hotwings in the valley and we've been to the top 5 listed on yelp, these are better. There strawberry shortcake is also amazing!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood place for Hockey goers! It's located right inside the Ice Den. Burgers are AMAZING! I'm not just saying that cause I work there. However I fell in love with them when I was a customer. The bartenders are cool, and friendly staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place sucks. The waitress is really rude and wont give you water unless you eat food. My friend and i went there after a public skate and he ordered a burger and the waitress charged us $21. The waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there and i went there yesterday and she was 10 feet away from me and was mad because i asked for a menu so i just got up and left also she wouldn't give me a water when i asked for one which seems very rude. I have been to 18 degrees many times and the food is decent but this waitress is rude.\n\n\n\n\n\nOvercooked my burger.\nCome on it's not that hard.\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse advertisement! Website says open until 11pm and the truth is...they are only open until the ice is open.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has the potential to be a nice  place.  First, they need a hostesses.  You walk in and nobody greets you. You even think you may have walked in through a wrong door.  \nI. Watched at least 5 customers ask the bartender how they get seated.  \n2. Hire people that want to work there. Unemployment is at 4.9% but I'm sure you can still find qualified people to be servers and bartenders in the valley.  \n3. Layout of the place sucks.  You have an entrance from the ice den and the street. Both create traffic right through the center of the restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place to have beer, bar food and watch a game.! There are plenty of screens to watch your favorite hockey game or another sport (if you can convince them to change the channel. There is a good selection of beers including Selections from Canada and also local craft beers. The food is ok, but what do you expect from a sports bar? The staff is friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Denny's. Poor management/manager. No personality in the place. Now let's get to the worst breakfast ever. Eggs over cooked on the omelette. Grapefruit brle-DON'T do it. Ice tea is like colored sweet water. Water was ok but not great. The bus boy just wipes the the table crumbs ONTHE FLOOR and leaves it!  If your going and expect over easy ...?  You're not going to get it. Get back in the car and drive away.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was pretty good. Great sports bar feel and you just might get to see an NHL team practice!\n\n\n\n\n\n18Degrees - go here if you want to be surrounded by annoying Scottsdale hockey moms who think they are still 23 and their husband who had their balls taken away 15 years ago. The only reason I would drink more here is to drown out my desire to punch someone in the face. Don't go here unless you're \"diva-licious shopping / whorish type\" who likes Botox, fake faces and fucking your sons teammates husband. The only thing they have going for them is Molson on tap. But unless they start serving that to me in my own personal pool - I can't be drunk enough to ever drink here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI definitely will not be running back to this restaurant....if you can call it that.\n\nI understand that when I got there that it was pretty late, but the place wasn't empty and about to close, so I DO expect good service.  First of all it took waaaay too long to get anyone to notice that we had sat down at one of thieir booths.  Our dumb waitress Jennifer was barely around and we couldn't tell if she was our waitress or the dumb brunette there that could not stop giving us dirty looks.  The manager i think he was, couldn't stop being a huge douche about the fact that I was the only underage person there.  He went out of his way to come by our table and say, oh yeah your waitress asked if I had checked your IDs before when you came to the bar for a drink, so I made sure to let her know that you (points) at me, were the underage one.  Well thanks you asshole, but pretty sure I ordered a god damn coke, and not a beer.\n\nWhen we had gone to the bar before hand for a drink, I asked for a coke, (this bar is about a 10 seater so you can see everything) and he got everyone their alcoholic drinks, and left me without a drink. Even though, I was sitting directly in front of his \"work area\".  Pretty sure you can see that my drink coaster is without a drink.\n\nNow to tell you about the horrible food that came out COLD.  The spinach dip was discusting too.  Didn't have any silverware, napkins or side plates untill half way through the meal.  Couldn't get a refill on ANY of our drinks.  I had my empty soda glass sitting at the head of the table and she walks by, \"need anything else?\" and the glass is sitting right in front of her.  Uh yeah....She added someone elses tab onto our bill without saying anything or asking.  Then took her a lifetime to put it on a seperate bill.  All in all, everything was just insanely horrible.  Worse than denny's and sorry guys, but that means A LOT.\n\nLet it be known, we're in an economic depression right now, and the first businesses to feel that depression is restaurants, and as a server, you gotta milk every table that you're lucky enough to get as much as you can, because those restaurant doors could be closed the next day for good.\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel, our server, is a historian. And she's historically accurate, which is to say, she's the reason we now dine here on the blood of enemies after our hockey games instead of Four Peaks. \n\nPete, one of the other servers, accused her faking the other reviews about this place for her benefit. Well, it's true, I am Rachel and I have obtained Elite status as Richard Z, Brad E and Dallas G For the purpose of self promoting. It's taken me two years but it was well worth it. \n\nMeanwhile, the veggie burger is good, the onion rings are as well, and the wii and the $60,000 live action video game system make me stay for more abuse from Richie Z. Brad E beat me really hard in a sword fight last week as well.   \n\nIt's good. If you're here, eat here.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarted off shaky when the hostess told us lunch did not start til 1 pm.  When it starts at 11.    Breakfast ended at 1.  Not busy at all yet service started off strong and then was mediocre.   Waitress was patient with us waiting for the rest of our party.   Drinks could have been filled faster- not until we asked for them to be filled.  Took 35 min for part of food order, the rest of order came 10 minutes after that.   Told waitress the service was poor, and she apologized but no compensation was given or even sending manager over to address it.  I should specifically asked.   Food was fine - yet pricey.    Black bean burger is yummy.     Sliders were cooked fast and not thoroughly through.    Fried chicken - wings- pretzel sticks were good.   French toast was crisp but good.    In a bind - will eat here again and hope for better outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our new post-hockey game hangout.  It helps that it is in the rink and that our usual server Rachel is prompt.  It helps that she is cute also.  We came the first time on one of it's first nights and it wasn't very busy.  The manager let us play the virtual sports game.  It has hockey, football, soccer, baseball, and golf.  We played for free, but it is rather pricey to use.  It was fun, but I don't think it would be worth using your dollars on.  The bar is owned by the same people who own Overeasy in Phoenix.\n\nI have only had the Black Bean Burger so far, but I tell you what.  It is f-ing good!  It has tomato, lettuce, red onion, and avocado.  I don't normally like avocado, but it's creaminess adds to it.  It has just a little bit of spice too. It comes with fries that are good enough.\n\nThe bar itself has cool interior and has lots of TVs around the place.  The booths even have their own televisions.  There is a large monitor at the front with a Wii hooked up.  I strained my shoulder after last weeks game bowling and playing ping pong.   \n\nSo if you find yourself cheering on the Rubber Mallets, enjoying an ice skating session, or watching someone at a figure skating competition at the Alltel Ice Den, be sure to stop into 18 Degrees for a brew and a bite.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame in so my kiddo could skate and I could just watch front the comfort of the bar.  Service was non existent.  The waitresses walked past me about 10 times.... never even making eye contact.  I had to go to the bar to get a drink twice.  The bartender was speedy and friendly!  It's annoying and frustrating to be ignored.  Tips are earned.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have never received such horrible service in al of my life.\nNot only is their food mediocre at best, my friend was ridiculed for cheering for the team they didn't agree with, promptly followed by being called a bitch, then asked to leave. \nBeyond embarrassing and terrible taste. Don't waste your time.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, so we were trying to go to overeasy and didnt realize that the hours were different in Scottsdale and Phoenix.  Soooo, we just wanted anyplace to eat and since this was next door, we settled.  BUT, I gotta say, we were surprised.  Both of us were happy with our sandwiches and the sides (I had roasted potatoes, he had green chile mac n cheese) were GREAT!  I was pretty happy that we made the mistake on hours and ended up here.  If I lived in Scottsdale, Im sure I would come here lots to watch hockey and have a good bite.\n\n\n\n\n\nA very needed addition to North Scotts!  All the ingredients for 5 stars are in place once they get things running smoothly.  Food is typical bar fare, but made very well and often with some imagination.  For example, their burger is ground on site and is to die for.  Their coleslaw is done with a different, pink, sweet dressing that's good and not the same 'ol.  The fries are a must do because they're as good as ones I've had in a french bistro.  Atmosphere is darned stylish for a sports bar, yet not snooty at all.  Good diversity of patrons, from young couples to teens to families with children, and all seemed happy.  Just three stars for now because they got our order wrong not once, but twice, but the conscientious staff look like they will have things running like clockwork soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nTasty big ol' burgers. (You could probably share if you're not a big eater.) Good, crispy fries. The kids' pizza is super cheesy - be careful with little ones so they don't choke. Located inside the Ice Den, you can take a break from skating to eat here without removing your skates. Lots of sports viewing options on multiple TVs. Full bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm unofficially giving 18 Degrees 3.5 Stars...\n3-Stars as a general restaurant; 4-stars as a sports bar\n\n18 Degrees has above par food compared to most sports bars I've been too. We stopped by to watch some of the Elite-8 tournament on Sunday and planned on having a mini pig out. We ordered onion rings to start... tasty and a good sized plate. I had the black bean burger. It came topped with good veggies: avocado, lettuce, red onions, and good tomatoes (hate the tasteless tomato slices served on most burgers). The black bean patty was decent; not the best I've had, but I'd order it again. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich but was brought the Buffalo chicken sandwich by mistake. Agreeable as he is, he said it looked good and was more than fine with having the buffalo one. He ate every last bite and said he enjoyed it. \n\nThe ambiance was great... kind of fun to have all the hockey rink right outside (you can actually look right into the rink through windows at the restaurant). There are TVs everywhere... our booth had our own individual small flat screen. My boyfriend said he's definitely going back with the guys.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy haven't I been here before now? This is a cool restaurant. It sits right behind the ice den so you can eat, watch live hockey games, and lots of big screen tvs around for other sports. I ordered the fish and chips and much to my surprise it was really good especially the French fries and cole slaw. I'm a Cole slaw snob so I would definitely say if it was not good. I got a side order of wings which I'll try later. The wait staff was attentive and service was fast. All and all a great experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I weren't held hostage at hockey lessons twice a week, I'd NEVER eat at 18 Degrees. The staff is friendly but food is very mediocre and overpriced for the taste...and I've been coming here for years so I've tried just about everything. The wings, if ordered well done, and the mac & cheese are good though. No complaints about Over Easy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe come here all the time after hockey.  It's just convenient cause it's right here.  The service is really bad.  I mean really bad.  Whoever owns this place needs to take notice and adopt a little business 101.  A little urgency in the service would go a long way.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a Groupon and decided to give it a try for lunch.  I got a swiss cheeseburger with fries and ice tea, while my wife went with a veggie pizza and rootbeer.  The burger was great, as was the fries and ice tea. My wife could not stop raving about how fantastic her pizza was, she said it was the best she has ever had.  I took a bite of it and almost wanted to take the rest away from her and eat it!  It wasn't the best pizza I had ever had but in the top 3, maybe even the top 2.  Great service too.  We will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG!  Went to a business luncheon here in the \"Warming Room\".  I literally had to stop on the way home and buy some real food to eat.  The worst chicken breast I've ever had in the most tasteless sauce I've ever had.  The chicken was full of gristle and was as tough as the bottom of my shoe.  Boring iceberg lettuce salad with generic salad dressings.  Steamed mixed vegetables in a strong herb sauce.  Egg rolls.  Nasty food!  \n\nWow, and for that I paid my group $25?!  Why is it that these restaurants that host groups can't serve decent catered food, and why is it that the catered food in no way resembles what they actually have on their menu???\n\nI won't be back.  Yuk.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a single person greeted us or welcomed us. We were not sure whether to seat ourselves or not.  Waitress did not want to be there, and it seemed like She did not want us their either.  Chicken \"flatbread\" was a poor excuse for a pizza. The chicken tasted like it was picked from a Caesar salad. I could literally taste the lettuce. I would stop at the vending machine in the ice den before this place again.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to this little place on Groupon, not one person working Sunday night could even smile. Not even the bartender. She was frowning so hard it looked like a upside down smile. Our server and the rest the staff doesn't seen to appreciate having a job. The food was decent bar food  but due to the severs and staff I will go tip and be in a place that appreciates your business.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ate there a few months ago and got the worst food poisoning I have ever had. I used to go daily because of how close it is to my office but it really messed me up and I would never go back! Service was always sub par and the food was just okay! Hope this helps others!\n\n\n\n\n\nCoyotes fans do not support 18 Degrees Neighborhood Grill. Tonight members of our pack were told to quit cheering for the Yotes because they're leaving to Quebec. When she argued backed, she was called a bi**h and told to leave. How can you call your self home of the Coyotes viewing party?\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation 5/5\nFood 3/5\nDrinks 3/5\nService 2/5\n\nI enjoy this location looking into the ICE DEN. I feel it's clean and well put together. There are plenty of TV's to catch games and watch ESPN.\n\nThe food is okay. Typical bar food, nothing special in my opinion. I enjoy their Poutine Fries and their wings (boneless or bone-in). I do not like their flat breads. I ordered their pick two lunch special for $9.50 + tax  and the flat bread or pizza, was tiny!  The other half of that order was the hot wings. Those were pretty good. Like I mentioned before, they are okay but nothing special. \n\nDrinks are plain. I didn't see any specialty drinks or their beer wasn't super cold like other places around this location. If you're not looking for much, this place works. \n\nNow the final part of my review is service. I feel this place lacks in service. I have gone a few times for two weeks now and there is the same few people that rotate. They all seem like they hate their jobs and they don't want to be there. I see people trying to talk to the bartender(s) and they get 1 word responses and move on. To me, I feel you should give your attention to your client. Especially if you want a decent tip. \nI recently had a sour experience with one lady that worked there. I asked what the daily special was and she said it was pizza for $8.50. (Wednesday) I looked at the sheet and ordered a NY pizza which is $12.50 thinking I would get the $4 discount. I spaced and didn't think about it but it was Tuesday. When we talked, she agreed it was Pizza Wednesday. I got my bill and asked the lady politely if there was an error. She said no and that it was Tuesday therefore, no special. She said it as if she knew all along but wanted to get me for a bigger tab so I can tip her more or for the restaurant to make more money. I don't mind paying full price for anything but it did upset me that she didn't say sorry for the mix up or offer to fix it because she told me it was the special. I would have honestly told her not worry about it but instead felt tricked. I just paid my tab and left. \n\nOverall, this place does get a 3/5 because the location is good and the food is okay! They do need to work on smiling or talking without sounding annoyed. I feel this place has potential to get a 4/5 or a 5/5 if their service was better.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service, always greeted with a smile. Ask to sit in Jason's section if you go!\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! The food arrived before I could even finish checking in on Yelp. The fries are just what I like and the turkey avocado sandwich with bacon is excellent!! It's not loaded down with greasy mayo or sauces, just simple and fresh and delicious. And Sara is the kind of server everyone would hope to have :). Great experience. Even watching the playoff game while enjoying the meal. Good stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is just ok,  average bar food. Stick to appetizers and beer, and enjoy watching the hockey.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to 18 Degrees last night with friends.  Place was crowded which was not a problem and noisy.  It was not our first visit and we have really enjoyed it in the past and told many people how much we liked it.  Well, things have changed!  They have a totally new menu and it is not nearly as good as the previous one.  The have cut the selections to a bare mininum.  The food was good, but the items we had enjoyed in the past are no longer available.  Just not what we wanted!  We expressed our disappointment to our server, who was absolutely great, and were told that she was hearing the same thing from many other patrons.  Rest assured that we will be finding another place to meet our friends that has a menu more to our liking.  We do not like settling for things we do not want.  It was a very disappointing experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing place to relax and grab a bite/drink while the kids are skating.  The bartender is always on top of things. There are so many TV'S and they have every sports game on.  Happy Hour specials every day as well as daily specials.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery quick to get our food, food tasted delicious!!\nGot the southwest turkey sandwich. So great!\nThe only down side was we barely saw our server...\n\n\n\n\n\nMeh.  We had a Groupon to try this place out.  Stood at the podium for a few minutes waiting for someone to seat us.  A staff member from the ajoining breakfast restaurant came out and told us to sit wherever and helped get a highchair for our child.  Maybe a sign would help next time?  I don't mind seating myself but I need to know to do that.  \n\nFood was ok but nothing super special that we couldn't get anywhere else.  Service came with a smile, but not overly friendly.  We got pretzels as an appetizer and they were great.  The cheese dipping sauce for them was very mild, almost watered down, but okay.  I ordered my burger medium.  The left side of the burger was very pink and the other half was well done.  The other person got the lunch special of sliders and wings and said it was good.  We'd go back and give it another try if we had a promo, but probably not at full price.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sad that I had a terrible experience here, because we live in walking distance and it had the potential to become a regular stop for us. \n\nBUUUUUUUT no. I had a living social voucher I think.. some type of social media discount. \n\nThe first problem they had with me, was that my voucher wasn't printed. Well on my iphone it clearly states, either print out your coupon or show the merchant your mobile voucher. If you are not going to honor mobile vouchers then maybe YOU SHOULD PUT THAT IN THE FINE PRINT.\n\nAfter I made it clear they were going to honor this, they tried to tell me I couldn't use it for happy hour prices. Now I would definitely understand this too, had IT BEEN WRITTEN SOMEWHERE ON THE VOUCHER. Nope, nowhere. So our bitchy waitress goes to get her manager because clearly she doesn't have the brainpower to think of another excuse for not honoring this voucher....\n\nSo then this braindead manager comes over. He proceeds to tell me that he would be fine with using it for happy hour prices but the computer will not allow him to do so. I tell him to enter it in to show me that it won't let him & SHOCKER. It does let him.\n\nNow why on earth would a place try so hard to make a customer unhappy. Because to say I left unhappy would be a fricken understatement of the year. \n\nDON'T PUT OUT A SOCIAL MEDIA VOUCHER IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ASSES WHEN WE TRY TO USE IT.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a shame what they have done with the place.  The menu is way to small and the drink prices are the highest around.  Kids menu is now a joke and we had to almost get them two meals for them not to be hungry.  Not sure what they are doing but their prices are now more than the Vig's, which is where most of the hockey families are now going.  If my math is correct they have lost close to 20k per year by our group not wanting to pay those prices and have only a few things to choose from.  Our last few bills were close to $100 bucks for a family of 4, at a bar!  Bring back the old menu and pricing and we would start to come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nhubz had a groupon.  he had a bacon cheeseburger and green chili mac and cheese.  I had the turkey wrap and green beans.  Food was fresh and tasty!  Our waitress was disinterested but this place is attached to an ice skating rink so she probably is used to parents coming in for just a drink or snack while waiting for their kids.\n\nit was fun to watch the ice skaters!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is nothing to write home about. I've had the burger and the Reuben which were just ok for me. Probably the best item that I have had was the Pretzel. The servers seem to be attentive, so they have that going for them. \n\nThe views of the skating/hockey rink from the restaurant is fabulous. The restaurant is decorated with a hockey theme as all of the NHL team banners are on display. They show live and taped hockey games on the TV. It's a great place to cool off on a hot summer day. The Phoenix Coyotes also practice here as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately spend a lot of time and $ here due to it being in the ice rink that my son plays hockey at....horrible service!!! Once again tonight sat down and waited 20 minutes with friends with zero service. Nobody took our drink orders, eventually got up and left. Too bad because they have a captive audience with the hockey families! Really need to get some better staff in!\n\n\n\n\n\nSome gal pals and I checked out this new place on a Sunday to catch a bite and watch some football.  The place was pretty empty when we arrived, but filled up by the time the Cardinals kicked off.  \n\nThe location and setup of this restaurant/bar is really unique!  It looks into the Ice Den, and I was tempted to sit closer just to watch people skate by.  There's lot's of virtual sports and arcade games (like hitting the hockey puck into the virtual screen, etc) so I could see this being a very fun place to kill some time and have a few drinks.  When my friends informed me that this used to be a Peter Piper Pizza, it instantly made sense.  I also really liked that each booth had an individual TV on a mechanical arm that you could position to whatever angle worked for your group.  Now it's true that I don't get out much to sports bars, but I thought that was a cool feature!\n\nThe food was.....eh.  Pretty typical bar food.  Several of the girls I was with got the pizza due to our server's reco.  It was homemade crust and they both reported it as pretty tasty.  I took her advice with her favorite thing on the menu and went for the pastrami sandwich -- it was mediocre at best, with pretty bland flavor and a really, really soggy bottom piece of bread.  I did finish the tasty fries though  :-)\n\nOverall, with happy hour specials (all day on Sunday!) and a convenient location, I'm sure I'll be back....but I'll skip the sandwich.\n\n\n\n\n\n9/5/13\n\nStopped in to use an expiring $20 for $10 Amazon Local Deals coupon**.  Was told to sit anywhere I'd liked, so I sat at one of the tables near the windows overlooking the Ice Den, the ice-skating rink next door-- pretty cool. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw#3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw  There were booths alongside one wall that had their own flat-screens, which were nice touches, and an area with leather (or was it pleather?) seating, and yet another flat-screen, which looked inviting.  \n\nThe young female server wasn't particularly enthusiastic or helpful about the menu offerings, but was honest enough to steer me away from the sweet potato fries when I inquired about them.  I have to agree with her that the green chile mac 'n cheese was the better option out of the two.  After studying the menus for many minutes, debating on trying three courses (app, entree, and dessert), or just two main entrees, and finally decided on ordering the Bacon and blue cheese burger, with green chile mac to start, and then later on going with the cheeseburger (cheddar) and subbed sweet potato fries for an extra $1.25.  (Perhaps she's not a sweet potato fry fan, or maybe she is and she didn't like the way they were prepared here?  I had to find out for myself.)  The burger patties weren't of high-quality-- I found them consisting of more fillers than meat and too fatty, yet not very flavorful.  I had a bit of the blue cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ#KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ for lunch at work the next day, didn't enjoy it, and threw away the rest of both burgers that night.  Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested \"extra-crispy,\" and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings (\"only the cheeseburgers have them\"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.\n\nThe happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.  I thought it something novel to be able to watch both novice and experienced skaters practice next door...  I hope I can bump up my rating next time.  That is, if I return.\n\n**Sister with two kids were coming for a visit in August, and I thought I'd take them ice-skating.  The kids weren't interested in trying on ice skates, so the certificate went unused.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust your standard sports bar... With glass walls so you can watch what takes place on the rink! The food is all right, but the experience is truly what makes this place special.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a chance to pop in here when I was in the neighborhood during happy hour last week and it was the best and most delicious surprise I've had in a while! Great deals on a huge selection of local beers on tap and I even discovered a cucumber honey cider from a local cidery that I didn't know existed?! The chile con carne we got as an appetizer was to die for and came with cornbread croutons. I repeat: Cornbread. Croutons. I still can't believe they exist. We had such a good time that we stayed for dinner and split the Albuquerque Turkey Sandwich, which sounds simple but was probably the best sandwich I've ever had. It was light, yet incredibly flavorful and the green chile added the perfect kick! Also, the red and green chile in both the appetizer and the sandwich were the real deal- I'm from NM so I can suss out the canned or frozen stuff. 18 Degrees served up fresh, spicy and authentic red and green chile! \n\nThe perfect amount of spice had us hankering for a cool dessert so we got the \"This Split is Bananas\" lol! The ice cream tasted like it was made in-house and there was the perfect mix of sweet and savory with fresh berries on one scoop of vanilla, light crispy pretzels atop a scoop of chocolate, and a few potato chips delicately balanced on the other scoop of vanilla. Wait, what?! Yes, it was crazy-incredible! And did I mention that the bananas were CARMELIZED? Now you see how the dish got its name. Seriously every course blew our minds. I live 35-40 min from here but I would drive to the moon for that chile con carne. We can't wait to come back and catch a game in the awesome sports bar lair part of the restaurant!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here last week with the husband for dinner.  Had a coupon, but once we saw they do Friday night Pizza and Pitchers (1 pitcher of beer and 1 any whole pizza for $15.  Are you kidding me!  That's AWESOME!!) and were running a fish taco special for $8.  We ordered both.  The pizza was good, thin crust, good on toppings.  The beer was cold (you can choose Coors Light or Molson.)  There were kids running around all over the joint, and parents gathered at tables having a glass of wine.  It looks like a great place to grab a bite or a beer while the kids are doing skate night.  Overall, the food was better tan average for bar food, and the environment is very family friendly.\n\nOne tip - don't get the cookie dessert.  It's $8 for a warm chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top, and the cookie was about 3 inches across.  I can get that dessert at Jalapeno's up the street with a 6 inch cookie.  Same price.\n\nOtherwise, definitely not bad!\n\n\n\n\n\nPopped in for lunch and decided on the BBQ burger with fries. Big and scrumptious and dripping with juice! Gotta order it medium. BBQ sauce, good bacon, and crispy onions. FAT PATTY. \nDislocate your jaw and shove it in!\nI was pretty much the only one in there so my burger came out pretty fast.\nCanadians will be happy for the poutine and Molson beer on tap. I don't know how good the poutine is, but it's there. Don't go for the beer, cuz Blue Moon is as edgy as they get for tap beers. Well I MIGHT have seen a Four Peaks but I can't remember. You can be SURE they don't know what an imperial IPA is. Anyway, good burger and it was convenient, but for $4 less I would go to Smashburger.\n\nUPDATE 11/02: Tried the regular, non-happy hour wings, which I was told were bigger than the HH wings. If that's the case, I would hate to see the HH wings, they must be pigeon size! I got 9 wings for $11.50 or so.  With tax and tip I left $14. GRRRRR!!!! Another wing rip-off, 2 in a week from 2 different places. I guess I'll stick to the burger if I go in again. I guess north Scottsdale is used to people flittering away their cash without thinking very hard about it. I'll stick to Zipp's or Casey Moore's for HH wings, at least I know I'm getting a lot for half the money!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm very happy with relaunch at 18 Degrees! You can tell a lot of thought went into the new design, and revamp of the menu. The short rib Sammy and four peaks chicken sandwich is AMAZING! Great service, and for a soft opening - they exceeded my expectations. A huge plus is that the restaurant is a scratch kitchen, with local fresh ingredients! Being from Minnesota I'm a huge hockey fan,   So i have a feeling I'll be here a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered the California burger this time.\nGood burger this time.\nIt's a dollar more if you want half fries and half onion rings \nOR all onion rings, and you don't get that many.\nZipp's does that for FREE.\nI think I'm done with this place. \nThe meal with tip cost me $16.\nI could've had TWO meals at Smashburger for that.\nOh and the wings are a complete RIP. \nI feel sorry for the chickens culled in their adolescence.\n9 wings With tip $15. Cuz it's not the SERVER'S fault they're such a rip!\nI AM ANGRY!\nYou pay for convenience.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent bar food and nice fast service!  The perfect getaway in Scottsdale during those hot summers!\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, this place is totally cool, regardless!  To be truthful, I only had an appetizer and beer when here, and I ate at the bar, so my service was terrific.  But...\n\nI couldn't get over how cool it was to watch the ice from inside the restaurant!!!\n\nThis is a GREAT place for a casual (albeit, very casual) date.  And, um, for my single sisters, where do you think you will find men?\n\nCan't wait to try it again!\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible!  Had the happy hour nachos.  The cheese tasted like old plastic and smelled like vomit!  Absolutely disgusting!    I would never eat here again!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a good time to go around 1:45 or so when we got there. Not many people there, great view inside Ice Den watching people do triple axles and such. Waitress helped us right away and very nice looking I must say. Food came fairly quickly was hot and delicious! I had the BBQ bacon burger with jalapeos and Onion Rings. I'd say probably a good tie for the best burger I ever had, I'm still partial to The Burger Shop. Restaurant is a great place for happy hour and the prices are way affordable, not to mention one of the cleanest looking restaurants I've ever seen. I definitely recommend 18 Degrees for Food, fun and excitement!\n\n\n\n\n\nI like 18 Degrees a lot, and bonus that it's close to home.  The food is nothing spectacular, but they don't promise to be a gourmet eatery; they're a SPORTS BAR!  You're mostly going there for a drink, appetizer, and to watch the people skate, since you can't do that at very many other places across town.  The service is always above par and the food is pretty tasty.  We'll def. go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI enjoy this place for what it its, always a good time.  We spend many weekend evenings here as my kids love to ice skate.  The hot wings are a staple to me.  We were not crazy about the type a cheese used on the nachos.  The white pizza and club are a hit for my wife.  kids enjoy the cheese burger and fries.  \n\nService is always with a smile.  Great place to have a casual date night with the kids near by with the right price.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered take out for the first time tonight...I suspect someone will be contacting me shortly regarding some missing hockey pucks, somehow they made it between the hamburger buns in my container of sliders.\n\nSo, we tried the ribs, cheeseburger sliders, fries, sweet potato fries, and mac & cheese.  \n\nRibs were generous in portion but fatty and just not worth eating.  The sliders I mentioned earlier are tiny individual patties that were black around the edges and chewy (like pucks), topped with a tiny piece of cheese on a bun  (no lettuce, pickle, flavor).  Their \"au jus\" for the burgers was served on the side and had no taste whatsoever, it wasn't even the \"salt assault\" style au jus that low rent places usually serve.  Mac and cheese was mushy and flavorless.  Fries were good.  Sweet potato fries never made it into the bag.\n\nOne common theme to all of the dishes was a complete lack of flavor.  On the plus side, we didn't dine there so we were spared the sound of screaming children while we ate.  I'm sure if you got a cold beer and some potato skins you'd probably be fairly content.  As far as a real dinner goes, absolutely not - it's terrible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis breakfast and lunch restaurant is all about great food.  Excellent portions, quality, and staff. Breakfast and lunch can't be beat!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyed watching hockey teams.  Tables and menus need to be cleaned.  Food was good. For a bar.  Staff is relaxed.  Friendly prompt\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a tough one!  I am puzzled by the nasty reviews - but after reading them, kind of understand!  This place has a great vibe, but it could be better.  You can watch hockey (or in our case, the Zamboni then figure skating lessons), the beer is  plentiful and cold, and the food was really good!  The pretzels appetizer scores a 12 on a 10  point scale, and the  hummus was delicious.  The fry sauce is tasty, and goes great on much more than just the fries!  At our table alone, we had that, plus a turkey burger (HUGE and delicious); the flat iron steak skewars which were cooked perfectly, lean and really flavorful, and the Asian salad (and the dressing was outstanding and I swear, there were two whole chicken breasts - not processed meat).  The bathrooms were clean, and the prices were reasonable. I can totally see how this place could become an easy hand-out.  \n\nOn service - our server had ZERO personality.  She delivered good service, and allowed one of us to \"sample\" the salad dressing beforehand, which was nice, but seriously flatlined in the conversation and true \"customer\" zone.  She did have another big table, but really, is that an excuse?\n\nWe'll be back, and it is certainly worth a try.  We were there for lunch, so I am curious what it is like for legit happy hour or dinner, or even later.  It's a cool idea.  If you go, Order the pretzels.  Period.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen coming here for years and when they opened the food was excellent and now it is horrible.  I think they have lowered their quality to save $$$$. I won't be going back anymore.  The chicken sandwich was horrible, the meat was nasty.  The fries were amazing there and now horrible.\n\n\n\n\n\nnot bad for a hockey rink.....very good service\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food couldn't overcome the bad service. No one to greet us at the door, but no sign to seat ourselves. One person walked by with no acknowledgment. Second person said hey'd be with us, but then said to just sit anywhere we want. Took at least 10 minutes for someone to take out drink order, even thought servers were serving the table beside us. there were about 3-4 tables in the restaurant, including us, and 3 servers, plus a woman who must have been the manager. She also walked by us without asking if we needed anything or if everything was ok. So, we got our drinks and waited another 10 minutes to order. One person needed sweetener for their ice tea and the server forgot, it took 20 minutes to ask someone again and get some. Had to ask for forks & knives to eat, and salt. It was a painful dining experience. I did like the food, but it was not worth the hassle to get it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHello Yelp Readers:\nMy husband and I alway went to 18 Degrees Neighborhood Grill for their burgers and fries.  While a little pricey for such an item in a bar atmosphere, we felt it was worth it because of the quality of the food prepared and provided to us in the past.\nToday, we went to the Grill and noticed there was a new menu.  Apparently, the Executive Chef changed and as a result the menu changed about three weeks ago.\n18 Degrees used to serve french fries which were always hot out of the fryer.  Not anymore.  Shoestring potato fries are on the menu now which were served to us lukewarm and had no flavor.  (Regular fries are no longer on the menu as an option).  We were very disappointed, because the one thing we could alway count on from 18 Degrees was a nicely cut/portioned french fry served hot and perfectly seasoned with salt.\nThe burger was \"good\", not fantastic.  The burger was not hot either, but rather just warm.  \nThere was no excuse for our food not coming to our table \"hot\" because no one else was being served when we were there.  So, the Chef/Cook could not have been overloaded with orders to keep track of.\nThe brioche bun served with burgers at 18 Degrees used to come toasted holding up to the toppings well.  The bun served to us was not toasted, it was dry, and fell apart while we ate our burger. \nTopping portions were fine (adequate).  There is such a thing as too many things on top of the burger diluting the overall experience.  There was just the right amount of lettuce, tomato, peppers, pickles, etcetera to balance the burger, which is why I still rated them three stars.    \nBeware, this restaurant is inside the Ice Den, which means it is \"cool\" or \"cold\" as far as a temperature surrounding you.  Even more reason to ensure food that is meant to be served \"hot\" is actually served that way to customers since the ambient temperature of the air cools down the food very quickly.  \nOur waitress was prompt and efficient. \nRegrettably, we will not be returning after our experience with the food in light of the Chef/Menu change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey had a renovation and a soft opening tonight. I'll tell you the food is absolutely awesome! I went there with my mom and dad and we had the scallops and the pork and the nachos and the meatballs it was all absolutely delicious. They've got a world-class chef that's a very creative specialist. The environment is great staff is very friendly and attentive. I'd highly recommend it and I would come back again many times. Their breakfast's are awesome too. The menu is very creative and very appetizing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy new favorite breakfast spot. Start it off the morning with a beautiful hike up to Tom's Thumb. We then head it over to the new 18 Degrees for breakfast. We received wonderful service and the food was great. The kids had chocolate chip pancakes. The other people in the party had chilaquiles, eggchiladas, breakfast burrito, amazing grapefruit and avocado toast.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food gets zero stars, but the service was great and it was neat to look at the ice rink.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorray for hockey.  It's unfortunate that beyond the tv's to watch the games this place fails both on food and beer.  They share a kitchen with Over Easy so I know that the kitchen can produce great food however the menu is horrific.  Someone needs to step into this century. The beer menu is also pretty pathetic.  You would think that a place in North Scottsdale would realize that people will pay more for good beer and that there is more to beer than just Coors light. I give it two stars one for the tv's and one for the friendly waitress.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the new 18 degrees! The staff to start with is amazing, they're super helpful and always checking up on us. Customer service is a huge deal to me and to see them on top of it is great! But another thing is.... how amazing their FOOD IS  I mean they truly updated their menu from breakfast, lunch, AND dinner! \n \nMy favorite breakfast dish is definitely the \"egg\"chiladas, instead of tortillas it's wrapped in egg and stuffed with chicken chorizo, topped with green Chile. For lunch I have gotten the bird is the word, SO FRESH AND YUMMY. I hope to come back and try more dishes. \n\nSo in awe with how amazing the remodel turned out. It's so modern and definitely a sports bar. I can't wait for their patio to be finished which should be soon from which they tell me!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI honestly do not see why there are such terrible reviews.  This place is a sports bar and nothing more.  It serves pretty darn good sports bar food.  The service is swift but not so friendly, the food is served swift and done well and all at a fair price.  We thought it was cool to sit by the window and watch them Hockey Skate and then practice the Figure Skating.  Really cool!  This would be a great concept in California!  We had the 18 degree Beef Philly with extra grilled onions and mushrooms with Onion Rings.  The sandwich was served with a juicy hearty portion of all and the roll was toasted nicely and the onion rings were really good served with Ranch sauce.  Not the healthiest of fairs but very good!  The chicken wrap was aloes a generous portion and the fries were golden brown crisp.  Also very good.  The place could use a face lift, a fresher environment and the staff could work on their people skills, however for just a sports bar, it is absolutely worth a trip!  :)\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, let me start off by saying that this is my first yelping experience. So please bear with me. I always read reviews before visiting a restaurant and/or bar. 18 Degrees had some very mixed reviews, so I decided to see for myself...\n\nA few of us decided to go to on Monday after work to check it out. I was blown away!!! Our server informed us that it was \"buy one burger, get one free\" day. Being the burger lovers we are, we all decided to order one. It was one of the best that I have ever had. I might put it a step above Indulge Burgers...and I love Indulge burgers. I did the classic cheeseburger with cheddar. It was a 1/2 pound patty grilled medium and cooked perfectly. The server said that they grind sirloin, chuck, and brisket into their burger for a perfect flavor. Well a perfect flavor it was. I'm not sure what kind of bun it was but it held up great without being too bready. It was served with a smear of mustard and ketcup with classic L,T,O.  All I can say is that I loved that friggen burger. The flavor was just incredible. My buddy had the \"Bacon Blue\" burger and loved it just as much. We all had a great time. Pitchers of beer were cheap and they had a ton of tv's all over the place. I will certainlly return. I never would have expected to have the experience I had knowing that I was going to a restaurant in an ice skating rink. It was actually a really \"cool\" atmosphere. Get it -- \"Cool\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is total Ice Palace......so it is a great place in the summer.  Really....if I lived closer, I would just sit here all day and order H2o.  I came here with a girlfriend only because she had a gift card.  It is kinda of cool you can watch hockey practice here. It is a total sports bar so the set up with TVs, I really liked.  I notice the booths had their own TVs...that is really a nice setup!  Anyhow, we had salads....not a specialty place for that kind of food......this place is all fries, onion rings and burgers.  Our salads were  bland but  for 9-10 bucks ....GET THE BURGERS!  We were out of our element but we had 50 bucks to spend!  What's a girl to do?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ordered the California Burger and Mushroom Burger.\n\nBurgers were good qaulity. The bacon was real dry and crunchy which made it seem like it was precooked.\n\nOnion rings were very good.\n\nBest part of the meal was very funny and one of those  momments you have to say did that really just happen.  I asked the waitress to wipe down our counter/table and she brought dry napkins and wiped it a little which did nothing and then she looked at me like all done. We could not stop laughing as I put some of my water on the table and cleanned it off with the napkins she left behind.   She seemed like she was new.\n\n\n\n\n\nI absolutely hate giving negative reviews, which is why I've never done it before.  However, after looking at how many 1 star reviews this place has received over the years, it's clear that the managers don't read these or don't care.\n\nThere is ZERO AMBIANCE OR VIBE with this place.  It's mostly an under 18 or over 60 place, and was 75 percent empty during late happy hour.  My wife suspected that it was probably a big hit with the Monday night Bible Study crowd.  The staff, while very pleasant, didn't seem terribly excited to be there, and I can't blame them when the place was totally empty.\n\nWe went up there to try the Wednesday Pizza special, as my wife wanted some for Lunch and Rosatti's didn't have single slices.  I basically made her order it against her wishes, since, how badly can you screw up pizza when it's your advertised special?  I'll never make that mistake again.\n\nWhoever makes the pizza should be drawn and quartered, and after that, shown the door.  Either the crust and/or cheese had a distinct \"mothball\" taste, and Ragu would have been an improvement on the sauce (no spice at all).  I've eaten every crappy frozen pizza on the market, and any of them would have been a massive improvement on this goop.\n\nSurprisingly, my Coors Light draft and chicken wings were just fine, but that didn't make up for the pizza.  After that ordeal, the least I could do was buy my wife a couple of normal Kendall Jackson Chardonnays, at $9.50 a glass.  This seemed a bit pricey for such a dumpy place, but we weren't taking any chances on the \"house\" wine.  That was too scary a proposition, even though they were less than half the price.  Thoughts of turpentine kept running through my head.\n\nYou couldn't pay us to go back to this place unless they blew it up and started all over.  The owners must be making money somewhere else because this place \"aint happening.\"\n\nIt's a real shame for such an interesting location.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I use to love this place but the past few times we have visited, it's definitely not what it use to be. The sounds didn't work on the tv at our booth.  We use to come in almost every Sunday to watch football but now they severely reduced their usual menu till 1 pm in Sunday since they share a kitchen with the place next door. There is usually open seating so it's nice not having to wait, but definitely not the same great experience we use to have.\n\n\n\n\n\n18 Degrees is a great place to take the kids on a weekend afternoon.  In addition to the kid friendly food, the booths have their own tv's, there are games and of course ice skating.  The food's good enough for parents too, the decor is nice and the people watching is some of the best in the area.  I saw more than one NoSco Juicy Couture-clad mom hanging out with a glass of wine while the kids did their thing - oh, not to be judgmental or anything :-)\n\nThe parking can look crazy, but a lot of that is from the rink and there's plenty of extra just east of the main lot. \n\nThis time around we had perfection for service, and really good food.  The grilled cheese is a must-try, trust me on this one!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found this place via Living Social last year.  Since it's located inside the Ice Den, an ice skating rink, there's no way we'd stumble across this place.  It's a pretty cool place to grab a bite to eat, drink, and watch sports.  There's plenty of TV's and the booths have small, private TV's that you can control the channel selection....perfect for watching a game!\n\nEvery time we come here, I get the Appetizer Platter (Onion Rings, Chicken Fingers, Potato Skins, Quesadillas), $12.50.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=vrTkMnVL__fBIoCQuV537g#vrTkMnVL__fBIoCQuV537g\n\nIt's a large portion of food, so plan on sharing if you order it.  The platter is delish for bar food.\n\nThey have drink specials and happy hour too, good stuff.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen here a few times and most times decent to good service.\n\nLast time I was there I had the best burger I have had in a long time. Great flavor!\n\nGood bar atmosphere and really nice to walk hockey or LaCrosse at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newly remodeled 18 Neighborhood Grill is a hit! I have been here in the past before the remodel and enjoyed it, probably more a 3 1/2 star grill before has transformed into a 4 1/2 - 5 star grill. \n\nService was a huge gripe previously, now, it's was perfect! Couldn't be better! The new menu, is equally awesome! \n\nWe tried the \"Shirt Rib Nachos\", and by far is my favorite nacho plates I have ever had!!! Between the meat, and the candy jalepenos, it is full of flavor. \n\nLastly, the atmosphere. It is more modern and inviting, however I do miss the hockey theme, but that is just me. Everyone will have different thoughts. I do however love all of the screen for sports and the huge TV wall! Will be a great place to watch the World Series, Stanley Cup, or any major sporting events! \n\nTop it off, of course it's kid friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for breakfast and was blown away...Thought it would be just bar/rink food...The food is a tad bit fancy, and reasonably priced...Best breakfast I have had in a long time...I would highly recommend this place(at least for breakfast) May have to check out lunch or dinner sometime too...\n\n\n\n\n\nLove that they upgraded this place and made the bar the central focus of the restaurant... before best I recall there were only a few seats for the bar area where now it seems to be half the restaurant sitting area.\n\nThere are still plenty of tables and outdoor sitting, but if I have to opt for an area (depending on party size) I always opt for the bar.\n\nI come here for a few reasons... one it is close to where I work, I know a few of the bartenders, and the food is great.\n\nBecause I have acclimated to the Phoenix weather I was freezing today at a mere 66-degree weather it was music to my ears when she said the soup of the day was chicken noodle. It was a very well balanced chicken noodle with the right amount of chicken! I'm sorta a chicken noodle snob as I make my own and though better (plug for oneself) this was top notch. The broth was also thicker than most would be used to but was a nice change.\n\nI washed down the soup of course with Molson Canadian (when in Rome)... but great!\n\nService was over the top. Probably one of the nicest bartenders in the area. Not only was she great with me, but the way she interacted with her co-workers and every patron that walked through the door was refreshing. I know I say this a lot but not anyone should be in the service industry and she was one that those that frequent establishments respect.\n\nWill be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nA worthy effort. I had the nachos, which I only ordered because they are made with movie theater cheese. Which is how the gods eat their nachos. They open up a can of iridescent, not-real, fake cheese, the kind that alternatively could be pumped out of a spigot. Proper. \n\nAnyway, this particular fake cheese varietal is green chile fake cheese, which has a hint of some flavor that displeases me mildly. But Rachel, the waitress, is very cute. A fact of which I approve. \n\nThey have Big Buck Safari so Dallas G can release his murderous rage on hapless computerized animals before returning to his i-won't-harm-you-if-you-dont-harm-me life. \n\nAnd the nachos are covered with chicken, black beans, sour cream, guac, salsa... and such. Definitely worth ordering. \n\nGreat reverse happy hour 10-close and all day sunday. Woooot\n\nSo best of luck, 18 degrees. Your 2nd day open is a worthy effort.\n\nI do have to say, though, one more thing about Rachel. She laughed at my story, and that gets her an A+ in my book.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here a few times.... and it has been OK each visit. \n\nWe have used Groupon like deals on two of our visits. \n\n***STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE ON TUESDAY NIGHTS*** It's kids eat free night... and this place is an absolute zoo.... especially if you are not into having kids running all around you while trying to relax after work. \n\nThe food is OK. I like this place because there are not many casual places in the area (with the exception of the Temple Bar down the street). I also like sitting and watching the hockey teams play. They have large windows that look right out over the ice.\n\nService was always good. Prices are reasonable. And try the fresh Bavarian Pretzel appetizers! YUM!\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir new menu is great.  Fish and chips are really good and they have fresh soups daily that are amazing.  Wasn't too fond of eating here before the changes were made....now I'll make sure I come here hungry while my daughters are skating.  Sean does a great job behind the bar as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot very good. Typical fried bar food. Ordered a southwest burger and asked for it medium well. Middle of the burger was very pink. Ended up throwing some of it out. The chips were just okay. It's not the worst food ever, but it's certainly not great.\n\n\n\n\n\nEh. If you're at the ice den - no harm, no foul. Otherwise - limited menu, over priced,average execution; if these are scratch made fresh cut fries - someone forgot to add the flavor. There are many other sports bars nearby that do it better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI spent the entire weekend at the rink for the turkey shoot tournament. This is our third year at the tournament and each year, 18 degrees proves to be such a great additive to the ice rink. \n\nThroughout the weekend, we had our team pizza party, happy hour in the bar, the breakfast buffet and football on the couch.\n\nAll the service I experienced was amazing. The feel of the restaurant is warm and homey. Each booth has their own TV for whatever sport, or cartoon, you want. The quality of food is good. Nothing to write home about but amazing for an ice rink. The prices are affordable. \n\nI recommend visiting 18 degrees if you have time to spare at the rink.\n\n\n\n\n\n18 Degrees is back on our regular weekend breakfast routine! Ever since Over Easy closed in April, we have been anxiously anticipating the re-opening! Would it be another OE, or something new? Well, it's something new, and it's fabulous, and it's 18 Degrees!\n\nWe've tried every breakfast dish  on the menu, and as Dorothy said in Wizard of Oz, we're not in Kansas anymore! If you're expecting OE, you're not going to get it! However, it is better, so much better in every way! The food is prepared perfectly and served exquisitely! \n\nFrom the simple eggs, hash browns and toast to the more exotic salmon, cream cheese, capers, onions on a toasted bagel, with stops at the breakfast burrito, tacos, egg-chaladas, eggs Benedict, and Bacon is my Jam (which you'll have to try to see how good it is)!\n\nWe haven't been there for lunch or dinner yet, but based upon the changes for breakfast, we can't wait to try it out!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped in a couple weeks ago for the happy hour and we were very impressed. We love the new remodel! The food was awesome, service was great, and the best part is it is kid friendly. We will for sure be back in for the happy hour nachos and sliders!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were at the Home and Garden Show at Westworld and my wife found this restaurant nearby so we decided to give it a try, it was great and hit the spot! It was hockey themed and attached to two Hockey Rinks. Our Waitress Jenny did a good job and we both got Protein Bowls which were huge and we wished we would of asked and shared one. The menu selection was kind of limited so they only get 4 stars for that, but overall it was a nice place.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had our wedding at the Ice Den and reception here, and it was perfect. Food was absolutely amazing, and every last person went out of their way to make sure we had any and everything we wanted and needed. We enjoy hanging out for Coyotes road games and Ice Breakers too. Whether just wanting to grab a beer or have a meal, 18 has something for everyone!\n\n\n\n\n\nJust reopened so hopefully they'll get their act together soon. The service was slow, food was ok but nothing close to Over Easy's breakfast which it was meant to replace. The design is all form and no function. Seating on the booths is at the wrong level and bench side too far from the tables. Our 7 year old was charged $6 for a glass of OJ! Will wait a good while before returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time since they have remodeled. The place looks great and I'm sure they spent a fair amount of money doing it. They should have spent some revising the menu. Same horrible food. The boneless chicken wings were \"pieces\" battered and burnt. An order of fries came out in a soup cup with a 1/2 portion cup of ketchup. Asked for more ketchup and they came out with another 1/2 oz portion cup. I guess they can't spare the ketchup or the salt and peeper which I asked for twice that wasn't on the table.  This is not a restaurant, just a bar pretending to be one.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpin girls from Mountainside Fitness decided to stop by here today for an after spin class brunch. We requested to sit on the patio which was so nice, the weather was perfect. This was my first time at 18 and from what I saw and know, they expanded and remodeled. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful! \n\nOur server was very thoughtful and tentative to our needs. \n\nI ordered the avocado toast and added a poached egg for an extra $1.50, it was cooked perfectly. The brle grapefruit was amazing. Plated perfectly. \n\nThe menu had a nice selection of items to choose from and I highly recommend stopping by for breakfast. Can't wait to try lunch there!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been coming here for years and they recently redid their menu. I can't believe I just paid $20 for a steak salad and they didn't even cook the meat enough.  They also took away Stella on tap. The menu is small and very pricey.  I will not be going back and no one else should until they fix what they broke.   New management made some bad decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here a few times. They do a decent job with their food. I have only had their hamburgers wings and sandwiches. Decent place to watch some sports as well.

I came in got a seat right at the bar. Yay for me.  I order a coffee omg it was delicious home grown natural. I ordered the special three egg scramble with sundried tomato chicken sausage, button mushrooms and local baby organic spinach and fontina serve with potatoes and toast.  I also order a side of Bacon because I had to try it. THIS PLACE FOOD was so good and filling.. I will definently come back here when I come back to Phoenix.. It was very much worth the drive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelieve the hype. That's all I can say. \n\nThis place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome! \n\nOn Saturday, get there as early as possible, put your name down on the list and walk over to the farmer's market for a quick look around and you'll be back in time to get your table... Food's great, service is quick and the prices are reasonable... Love this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is fantastic.\n\nAbout the restaurant itself.  It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.\n\nNow about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.\n\nNow for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.\n\nThe second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).\n\nBefore I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.  Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Food. Great Coffee. Great Service. Amazing Hash-browns! Can't wait to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it begins....I have finally started reviewing all the restaurants that I tried on my tour of the Southwest this summer and Matt's Big Breakfast was a BIG way to start it off!\n\nBeing from LA which seems to be the home of trendy but good and always crowded breakfast spots, I understand the love/hate relationship that people have with their local breakfast spot that have just become way to crowded.  That being said, I left LA to try some of the favorites in other cities.  The good thing about being on vacation is that you can schedule your meals around the crowds instead of dealing with them.\n\nSo we drove into Phoenix around 11pm under the blanket of the night which was great because the days were reaching 120 degrees.  It was quieter then most cities, almost ghost-town like.  We stayed at the motel next to Matt's Big Breakfast.  I think its called the Coronado or Casablanca Hotel.  It was more of a Motel then Hotel and definitely not the Holiday Inn.  Although a little on the scary side it served its purpose.  The goal was to wake up and walk into Matt's.  And that goal was certainly achieved.  \n\nAfter a super long wait of about...3 minutes (9:30am) we sat down and took a look at the menu.  \n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1410-1.jpg\n\nIt wasnt as big as I thought it was going to be (haha)...well, it wasnt as expansive as I thought it was going to be but I would rather restaurants do what they do right instead of tons of things done wrong.\n\nI got the Hog & Chick and Griddle Cakes.  Thick cut bacon and perfectly made eggs with delicious potatoes.  Nice thick bread and homemade jam came along side.  Im not a fan of citrus jams/preserves but this was fantastic!\n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1415.jpg\n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1417.jpg\n\nThe pancakes were possibly the best of the trip and also some of the best I have ever had.  Everything we had was great!   Our server/owner  even came and talked to us about our trip, the town and even gave us some other suggestions on places to see and eat at while in Phoenix.  I wish I could have tried some of the places she suggested but...alas, we still had a ton of places still on our own list.  \n\nOff to Joe's Farm Grill!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nShort on menu, long on taste. A small diner, with a great small town atmosphere rules the morning meals. \n\nI got a recommendation from a collegue who like me was hungry for a good meal to get the day started. That said a short walk from the hotel, we quickly found a place with a crowd surrounding it. \n\nWe signed in and found a place outside to sit and wait. Friday morning, 9 am, we waited about 20 minutes. \n\nThe tables are small, their glasses of orange juice aren't very large, however it was freshly squeeed from what I could tell. \n\nWe both had the special, and it was a nicely portioned meal that filled is both up without regret. Their fasted fresh, and it was full of flavor. It was perfect for the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been to hash brown heaven. When I order hash browns I usually have to specify that I want them extra crispy otherwise I get a lump of anemic grated potato.  Not at Matt's.  They know what kind of hash browns this girl likes - a good crispy crust with a creamy almost mashed potato-like interior.  \n\nI also ordered the waffle and bacon.  The waffle was light and fluffy and very tasty with the real maple syrup.  The bacon was thick cut and had a delicious peppery exterior.  \n\nNow, if only I could get them to open one up in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be a line ... you will wait - probably for an hour ... and you'll be happy you did. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The burger was one of the best I have ever had. \n\nDon't let the appearance of the building scare you off. Make it happen. This place lives up to the hype.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter standing in line a few minutes on a weekday, we made our way to the bar, I ordered up some pancakes. I should have had the special which turned out to look really good. The pancakes were alright, not great but OK. One thing about pancakes they are designed to need syrup, after all a pancake is a syrup delivery system. The pancakes came with about 1 ounce, about half of a shot glass of syrup. I knew right off that wasn't going to get it done but I figured no problem I would just ask for some more. I asked for more syrup and the lady wanted to make sure I understood they charge $1.50 for syrup, I said bring it on after all what good are pancakes without syrup. The refill came and it was probably about 1/2 an ounce of syrup. I ate most of the pancakes but ended up leaving some since pancakes without syrup is boring.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favorite breakfast place for breakfast. Try the hog and chick . Daily specials are sure to please\n\n\n\n\n\nThis little place was great for breakfast.  Service was great and the food better.  It was paced and the just keep the coffee coming.  Was worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nButter Burger. For breakfast.\n\nWhat part of that is ambiguous?\n\nNo reason to waste space saying what has already been said: best breakfast in town. Sure Matt is mean to me. And I don't go there enough. But my wife is 10 years younger than me and I have to maintain my svelte figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have heard of Matt's Big Breakfast  many times since moving out here to Phoenix. Our family from other states have heard of this place as it has been featured on Travel Channel & Food Network. So we finally decided to give this place a try to see what the big deal was all about.\n\nMatt's actually moved down the street from their original location, which I had heard was very small. The new location which did appear much bigger, still had a long wait out side. There were a few benches that patrons can sit on & orange flavored water was offered outside for those waiting. \n\nThere was approx a 45min for out party of 4. Good thing we didn't come hungry. Once inside we were offered Bar seating, otherwise the wait would have been at least another 20 min. In my opinion, the bar stools were very slippery, or maybe it was just mine. I was wearing jeans, but I felt like I has to keep one leg on the ground in order not to slide off. & i'm kinda short so I was basically standing at the bar to eat.\n\nDefinitely a busy Breakfast spot. They state they use local resources & organic foods. \n\nThe food was tasty. I ordered the griddle cakes & they were BIG. I had to ask for more syrup which they said they would charge us another $1.50 for. \n\nNo one in our party was able to finish what we had ordered. We left with very full bellies. \n\nStill not quite sure what all the hype is about. The act of supporting Small Business?Yes, we will always try to do that. Or maybe I just needed to order something more adventurous?  Know you must come with a BIG stomach, but not hungry, because the wait is ridiculous. At least we can cross this place off of our Food Bucket list\n\nHappy Eating\n\n\n\n\n\nGreasy spoon with quality ingredients cooked to harden arteries. The service was less than stellar, but the atmosphere was cozy (read: tight) and not terribly unpleasant. The food was standard tasting - this place could do with a regular deep cleaning and perhaps some attempt to de-grease the food prep. The service could also use a bit of a boost... perhaps they should partake of their own coffee - the caffeine could help wake them up a bit.\n\nThere are some great little places like this dispersed around central Phoenix that give the downtown area some great character. This one is on the low end of the group. A few small changes and this place could easily improve to a 5 star  - but since it's so popular, there's hardly a reason to change anything I suppose. \n\nI'm thankful that I live near downtown Scottsdale where awesome breakfast choices are bountiful. Matt's is worth a visit, but only just.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went by myself and waited an hour and a half on a Thursday morning. The hostess was rude, after a mix up when she called me (the name she called before me didn't come so she went to seat me, but then realized that she said the name wrong so I waited ten more minutes and then she called tables who were after me), she told me \"oh there's a table inside in the corner you can go now\". I felt super rushed and that I was inconveniencing the restaurant. The waiter I had seemed not all there. The food was ok but definitely not worth the hype and price.\n\n\n\n\n\nbest breakfeast downtown ... bar none ... it's far more \"healthy\" than I traditionally prefer but the place is beatiful, very cool and has an ADORABLE waitress ;) !!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nLong wait but amazing food!!! The five spot sandwich, hash browns, and bacon was the best!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth the wait! The food is big and yummy in this tiny little restaurant! The owner was there and was very nice!! The waffle was great and the bacon was awesome!! I will come back the next time I'm in phoenix!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother downtown joint I hadn't bothered reviewing because it's such a part of my regular routine.\n\nI love hash browns and Matt's is a hash brown lover's paradise. I don't know exactly how they cook their eggs; I just hope that whatever they do, they keep doing it. It's tasty. \n\nI have friends from Tucson who crash at my place on an occasional weekend, and every Sunday morning before they head back to the Old Pueblo, they insist on my taking them here. They're as addicted as I am. \n\nLong lines on Sunday mornings so expect a wait and bring good conversation topics with you.\n\nNOTE: MrK took some great shots of the place that you can see above. His last interior shot does indeed have Matt in the background, and the very cute Gretel toward the right (she also waitresses at the Roosevelt).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I am in the mood for an omelet, hash browns and sourdough, this is my new go-to place! I don't care that I live 45 minutes away, and frankly, I don't care about the wait either!  MBB is worth every penny! So the place is really a hole in the wall, and it is noisy at full capacity. I haven't gotten out of a sit-down breakfast joint with even mediocre omelets and terrible coffee for less than $25.00 for two, but at MBB, we hit the jackpot! Here, I got a fluffy omelet with mushrooms (not from a can) and a mound of cheddar cheese, cooked perfectly (and I didn't even have to ask for it on the soft side), along with a heaping portion of the best tasting hash browns (fully cooked and not part raw)! And the sourdough toast . . . at least an inch thick, already buttered -- yes, buttered -- with homemade strawberry jam on the side. And, did I mention how great the coffee is, and within about four sips, they are there to give you a refill without having to wave them down?\n\nEveryone was so nice, from the nice young man who seated us, to the two (or three) waitresses that alternately handled our table (one took our order, two refilled our coffee, another took our bill). Service was top-notch! I can't think of any restaurant in our area of North Scottsdale that is even close to being this good! Especially for the price!\n\nWhen our waitress asked if she could get us anything else, I said, \"another Matt's Big Breakfast . . . in North Scottsdale!\"  I've already started coming up with a list of things we have to do in Phoenix so that we can go back to Matt's again!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband had been buggin me to go.... always at least an hour wait, so I went with my sister who was visiting on vaca form LA.   only 25 minutes outside on a midweek morning about 930 ....  weather was good so that part was fine....\nI had the special, which was a pork loin benedict, and she had the hog and chick (ham and eggs).  I ordered the wrong thing for sure.    the server recommended the hashbrowns, but my husband said home fries (of course via text, after I had ordered).   the hashbrowns were DROWNED in butter.   Not a bad thing but a heart attack waiting to happen, for real.   service was great, they churned and burned us and got us in and out.   But not sure what the hype is about.  its close, but not cheap as far as diners go, so in my mind I think i would have rather just eaten at home.  \nso 3 stars, for locally grown food, good service, and a little pricey.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother breakfast in the books, thanks in part to yelp and the devoted food review culture. Upon arrivng at Matt's Big Breakfast, the line is insanely intimidating. If we weren't so far out of Scottsdale, I'm not sure my girlfriend and I would have withstood the wait. Boy were we happy with our decision to stay. The wait lasted about 45 minutes and we were in and out of the restaurant in about a half hour. I ordered the Five Spot sandwich and my beautiful girlfriend ordered the pork chop meal. We both had water with our meals and the total cost was $19.06. The wait staff is fairly attentive, nice, and very efficient. Unfortunately, we buffered the wait with coffee drinks from Royal at the Market coffee, located just down the street, and they told us at Matt's that outside drinks are not allowed which kinda sucked being that we just waited for 45 minutes in the hot sun. At this point, our expectations were very high and we were a little irritated by the wait, therefore the food had to deliver BIG...and it pretty much did. My sandwich was on a great brioche bun that was loaded with cheese, sunny side up egg, and two great slices of bacon. I also ordered a side of homefries which were perfectly seasoned with herbs and grilled onions. We both agreed the homefries rocked. My grilfriends pork chop was fried and came with this interesting light basil pesto shmear that was perfect. Her eggs were scrambled and the hash brown potatoes were more like a potatoe pancake and she liked it. Her dish also came with local sourdough toast and a great mixed berry jam. Nothing in this meal was cooked bad or served cold. We will probably return again as long as the temperature outside permits. One last FYI: Beware showing up in large groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were heading towards Scottsdale from Peoria and wanted a great breakfast place.  This breakfast did not disappoint!  We had to wait about 45 min. due to all the Oregon and Auburn fans in town, but well worth the wait anyway.  I had the pancakes and they were the best I have had served up in a restaurant.  My husband had the eggs, hash browns (crispy and buttery), toast with home made strawberry jam (like freezer jam my mom use to make with strawberries from our garden) and thick peppery bacon that you could smell cooking while waiting outside.  Next time I think I might ask for the jam and spread it on the pancakes.  Very limited menu, but like a lot of people say pick a few things and make them very good.  This is exactly what they have done there.  \nYou might even have a chance to meet the owner of the building and the Hotel Coronado next door, he mingles in the crowd and likes to strike up conversations with anyone.\nWe have had many people recommend different restaurants to us and they don't always live up to the hype, however this place was above and beyond what we expected.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast:\n\nYes it's busy.  Yes it's tiny.  And yes there's a 45 min. wait on a weekday @ 10:30.  Don't you people work?!  \n\nBut you know what?  All these things add to the charm of the place.  I secretly believe that people like to wait, they love the anticipation, people eat that sh*t up.  \n\nNow, with that being said, on to the food, it truly is delicious. There is no hype when the restaurant can actually deliver and prove that it was worth every minute of the wait. \n\nLemonade: fresh squeezed and flavored with honey.  A natural sweetener that is incredibly refreshing on a hot day. \n\nWaffle: most definitely the best waffle I have ever had.  Fluffy, light, piping hot, real butter and real maple syrup. \n\nOmelet: quite possibly the best omelet I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection with American cheese, mushrooms and bacon.  No skimping on these additions either, large button mushrooms, plenty of cheese and large chunks of thick cut bacon. \n\nThe bottom line....\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast:\n\nBig on taste.  Big on portions.  Big on appeal.  Even bigger on charm.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party. We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day. This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two. \n\nI had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.\n\nGreat value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How far is the drive from LA to Phoenix?\" \n\nI recently caught myself contemplating this one morning in my home in LA. That is how good this place is! \n\nRecently, on a business trip, we went for a sort of brunch/lunch. My wife had already had breakfast there that morning and insisted we return. Myself, being a skeptic, lowered my expectations so I would not burst her bubble. After my first bite of their Reuben sandwich and their hash browns I began to bubble myself! In a good way of course! \n\nThe combination of the QUALITY ingredients and the simplicity of the items made everything we ate a joy. This is a trait I have seen through most of Europe and hopefully the trend is coming here. Quality and simplicity are king! \n\nNow the trick is to somehow get back to Phoenix. Foiled again, I knew there was a catch to this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a fan of Guy Fieri and this makes the second restaurant from DDD I have visited. I will be honest and tell you that he co-owns two restaurants in California, one of them being a place called Johnny Garlic's. The food was VERY VERY mediocre so I started to wonder if I should trust his taste in food, but then I said ok he goes to these places because people write to him and tell him they are amazing, not because he has any participation in the restaurant itself. So my mom and I went yesterday (Saturday) morning for breakfast. \n\nWe got there around 9 I think and we had to wait about an hour before we were able to be seated. \n\nWe looked at the menu and were like what the heck this is just basic breakfast food, did we just make a huge mistake? Boy were we wrong. The OJ was great. The coffee on the other hand, eh. I've had a lot better. \n\nI ordered the omelet with provolone and mushrooms and onions and home fries and sourdough bread. \n\nMy mom ordered the eggs with hashbrowns and slice of ham. \n\nThe omelet was huge and gooey with cheese. The mushrooms and onions were cooked to perfection. The home fries were only ok, and that might be because they were a tad cold. The bread is obviously homemade and the jam that came out with it was incredible. \n\nMy moms ham was great. We were not expecting such a big slice and such a thick slice. The taste was amazing as well. \n\nAfter breakfast we walked across the street and went to the farmers market. \n\nI am visiting from California, and should I ever find myself in Phoenix ever again, I will definitely come back and maybe next time try the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. \n\nThe only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the coffee and the limited menu options.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's that you say? This is the best breakfast in town? Why I think you're right! Simply put, Matt's does the simple American breakfast and they do it rather well. I go for waffle, eggs, bacon, home fries. BAM. A good morning indeed. Small, cute, very 50s feeling. Sure, there's a line out the door, but it's well worth the wait. Trust me.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided that we would take in another great breakfast this Saturday at Matt's.  The food again was awesome that is not my beef.  We arrived at 0600 and our course there was no one else there since they still didnt open until 0630.  The employees were busy getting ready for the day.  Meanwhile some other customers started showing up and it seemed that a few of them knew each other so they must be regulars there.  \n\nThe door opened and 0630 and a young blond lady invited us in with the others that were waiting.  This is were it happened!   I walked in the door and chose a table to the right and was informed that \"that table is set for three\".   WTF??    We were the first people in the door and anyone who has ever eaten knows that it is open seating and if seats are not available then you put your name on a notebook sheet of paper by the door and wait.  So, we sat down and watched three \"men\"  cruise over to the table \"set for three\"....   I guess that they get prefered seating over other customers.   I know it sounds petty but the tone of little blondy completely pissed me off.......  I dont think it was right and I think her tone was rude and you could tell she really didnt care what we thought about it..\n\nI will think again before returning to eat here.   There are a lot of choices alot closer to home for breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter waiting outside in the rain for over an hour to get in, we finally got one of the only ten tables (if even that) in this place.  \n\nI do have to say that everything was fresh and everything tasted great... But... it's breakfast.  I know that big chains can somehow screw it up, but for the most part, it's not that difficult to pull off. \n\nThis is one of the better places I've had breakfast... Maybe it was the hype, maybe the wait in the cold rain, or maybe it was just the food.  \n\nWas it worth waiting in the rain for an hour?  No.  Was it worth waiting an hour without the rain?  No.  Was it some tasty breakfast?  Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\nI visited a friend in Phoenix. She knew I was a breakfast buff so she took me to Matt's Big Breakfast since it was so well known around the city and the country. I enjoyed my meal but \"big breakfast\" was a bit misleading.\n\nFor starters, I thought the breakfast menu was particularly small and the options on the menu were strange. There was a breakfast sandwich, cheese omelet, pork chop and eggs, pancakes, salami scramble, waffle, oatmeal and frosted flakes. Yes, you could order frosted flakes for $4.50. Why? I don't know. Nothing really appealed to me on the menu which was strange.\n\nI chose eggs over easy, bacon and hashbrows with toast. The bacon was phenomenal. This may have been the best bacon I've ever had. The hash browns were thinly shredded and very crispy but not burned in the slightest. The toast was thick and chewy with homemade jam. Everything I ate was excellent.\n\nThe service was atrocious. I ordered a coffee. I got one cup which was luke warm. I asked for a refill but that refill never came. I asked for water and that didn't arrive until the end of the meal. No one checked on us after we got our food. \n\nI heard they moved to a new place which is nice, industrial and modern inside (think Chipotle) but it's small. The lay out is also stupid and there is a lot of wasted space. \n\nEven at 9am there was a 1/2 hour wait to eat. I don't know if it's worth it. The food is excellent and well prepared but the rest is a bit of a mess. The menu may be small but it's all done well. I don't think I'd wait very long to eat here again. I've had better breakfast in Phoenix and I'd go there instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service and the coffee were absolutely excellent. The preserves and ham were tasty, as well. Their use of local produce and ingredients is a plus. However, the menu is limited and overall, our selections were merely good - not great. Our rosemary potatoes were under cooked and the eggs were far too runny. I would have understood this had it been busy, but it was just after noon and the cook was not overburdened at all. I would go back if the wait is a few minutes, but I would never stand around for a half hour plus for a table.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have Mr. Pibb. That's fun. I first read about Matt's in an America West in-flight magazine and put it on my list of places to go.\n\nYou know the wait was about 20 minutes, the staff was quick and the food was good. I would say the biggest appeal about Matt's is that it seems like the food is reliable, you go there for breakfast and guess what you get it straight up.\n\nWhat I most appreciate, is that Matt saw potential in an old downtown building and is doing his part to bring business to that part of town.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell my fellow foodies, I have been to the promised land yet again. This time on a Saturday morning with 7 friends and 2 toddlers in tow. When we got there 2 couples were on the list ahead of us. We only had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes to be seated 6 of us were at the counter and 2 plus the toddlers were at a table. \n\nEveryone loved the food, we had hog and chick, chop and chick, Waffles, Pancakes and the special 3 eggs scrambled with baby spinach, mushrooms and fontina cheese. Can you say delicious! \n\nWe were all very happy with our selections. Again the food gods must be smiling down upon me as I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table and my food has always been delicious!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic breakfast place.  Always worth the wait.  Found the place from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show.  I'm a big fan of breakfast, but I also know what a great breakfast tastes like.  This is it.  Don't be discouraged by the wait time or the close quarters.  Belly up to the counter if you're claustrophobic.   \n\nEverything I've eaten off of the menu has been stellar.  Some reviewers said orange juice was small, but it's fresh-squeezed and delicious (unless you just brushed your teeth).  Hog and Chick, Griddle Cakes, Waffle and Bacon, all phenomenal.  \n\nService is always excellent here.  Sometimes there were three different people waiting on our party, but we never lacked for a thing.  Give it a shot!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe french toast is RIDICULOUSLY delicious.  I love Matt's! Definitely one of my favorite breakfast places in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatts Big breakfast is great.  We go there frequently.  Yes it is small but isnt that part of the deal that makes Matts place special?  I think so.  They really do a great job of using every inch of the place to feed hungry patrons.  Almost always the service is quick, and typically the staff is helpful.  There has been the occasional bump in the road but we go there often and everyone can have an off day.....I will be back! \n\nIf you want a great breakfast Eat at Matts!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, so I have heard all the hype over Matt's and just never thought to go, as I don't usually have the patience to wait 2 hours to eat.  Fortunately, the missus and I had this morning off together and thought it might be easier to get in for breaky.  The wait was about 15 minutes when we got there, which is nothin.  We were seated at the table why the window and were greeted promptly.  I had a coffee and we both had fresh squeezed oj.  We both opted for the cheese omelette with mushrooms and onions, I had whole grain toast and she had sourdough that was served with house-made preserves (the bread, I learned, comes from Wildflower Bakery) and it was soooo effing good!  The hashbrowns were magical, all golden brown delicious on the outside and soft and gooey in the middle. We also shared a waffle for a breakfast-style dessert.  It was very good and I will definitely go back for more!!\n\n\n\n\n\nOh Matt, \nWhy-O, why-O did you have to move? Who cares that your old place was small? It was part of the quaint location. No matter.....your food is still worth waiting in the beaming heat. Keep it up with the 'no microwave' & local produce kitchen. Cheers!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like breakfast and everything it stands for, you've got to come to Matt's.  The reviews on Yelp sent me here, and I'm so glad they did.  The food is delicious, and buttery, and fatty.  But if you know in advance what you're getting in to, there's no room for complaints.  The food isn't healthy to put it mildly, but it's delicious. And it's perfect if you're hungover.  Seriously.  Go have breakfast here, take a nap when you get home and you'll be good to go.  \n\nBe advised that there is quite a wait on the weekends.  I had to wait around 35 minutes the time I went, but after reading all the reviews, I knew what to expect, so I didn't mind it. Good food usually means a considerable wait, so just suck it up and go anyways.  Once you try the food, you'll forget you had to sit outside for 40 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nYummy food. Not sure it's worth the wait all the time. But the vibe is nice. I've had the Chop & Chick, an interesting pair, but it works. Also had the waffles that were tasty, although a bit too sweet. My fault cuz I poured all the syrup on. But the bacon is outstanding. A definate must try place. The service is great and location has character. Bring your change for the meter and go potty before you come.There is no restroom inside. There is a public \"half-way house\" kinda bathroom next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing from a diner-centric middle america, I was a little underwhelmed at the limited menu at Matt's, but boy, what he does cook he does excellently. The scrambled eggs I had in my special were easy enough, and I liked the combination of the local shishito peppers, ham, and jack cheese, but the hashbrowns are a shining example of how to execute them perfectly. I wish I had the bacon, too, because that also looked outstanding. Like many of the best places in Phoenix the line grows exponentially by the hour, so get there early and prepare to wait. It's interesting to see the large amount of abandoned restaurant concepts in the surrounding area, but I don't expect Matt's will be among them anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is the best breakfast in town. It used to be so easy to get a table too until Guy Fierri  had them on his show and now you wait at least 45 mins for a table.  But the food is so good OMG it is still worth it. It is so tiny but the food is huge!! The fresh fruit preserves on the homemade bread, the home fries with fresh rosemary and caramelized onions, yummy sunny side up eggs with a GIANT piece of ham. I just cannot stress enough how mouth watering delicious this little gem is :)\n\n\n\n\n\nI wouldnt recommend this place for vegetarians, as they have zilch, excpet for pancakes, toast, omlette and stuff, for which I can go to ihop next door to me. The omelettes for vegetarians doesnt make the cut for me as on top of not having too many options for vegetarians, they charge much for every single topping on it. \nThe place isnt as big as the name suggests ;) but I love places like that which remind of an old house converted into an eatery. dont get me wrong, but the place is too small, but is super popular in circles, so expect a long wait time, we waited for 30 mins for 2 PM on a Tuesday. \nBut the price suits well for the Big in the name, the servings arent as big though as the name suggests. I like the build of the place, but I am not going here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are in for a treat if you don't mind an hour+ wait!  Cute little place with good service. My favorite dish is the the Chop and Chick.  Definetly worth a try and if you're really lucky you might get to witness a drunken bum fight in their parking lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfect if you are craving a home-style breakfast.  I had a wonderful mushroom scramble, sausage, and the walnut raisin toast.  The portions were big and the food was very good - quality ingredients.  My only gripe is the orange juice.  It was $2.50 for a shot glass size cup of orange juice and it was half pulp.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere isn't much to say about Matt's other than they have the best damn breakfast in the Valley.  You have to appreciate a homegrown diner where the owner makes everyday appearances, his wife runs the place, and they use the best, freshest, local ingredients.  Kudos.\n\nI get the Hog and Chick every single time I go, I never stray.  Eggs over medium, hash browns, wheat toast, and the best damn bacon ever.  Always perfect every time.  I have never tasted bacon so good in my life.  The hash browns are out of this world.  They get shredded super fine and are cooked up on the griddle in loads of butter.  The BEST.\n\nIf you want to seem cool and in the know, at lunch time order the Insider Burger.  It's a traditional burger smothered in cheese, bacon added, and topped with an egg.  My brother loves it.  Similar to a Royal Red Robin Burger, but obviously superior.\n\nThe only negative is the wicked crowd that can form for breakfast.  Bring a lot of water with you and some sunscreen if you can brave the summer wait.\n\nSimply put, this place is amazing.  I am so lucky to be so close to this place.  Sometimes to avoid the wait, my husband and I wake up at 6:30 on a Saturday morning, head over for breakfast and beat the crowds.  After a hearty button bursting breakfast, we ride our bikes home and go back to sleep.  That is the life my friends.  You should try it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, here it is folks. My first 3-star rating since starting this project (http://www.hngrysam.com/?p=20) about four months ago. And I'm sure I'll get some flack for it!\n\nI met a friend at Matt's for breakfast around 9am on a Saturday. I expected a wait, and a wait we got. It wasn't too bad, there were benches and shade and lots of conversation. After about 30 minutes we were seated at the bar inside the teeny tiny restaurant.\n\nI loved the simple old-school vibe. We ordered and our food came out FAST, which was nice since we'd been waiting a bit. The food was simple and good, and the service was really great. But why all the hype?  Is it rude of me to give a lesser rating because the place doesn't hold up to the Yelp standard?\n\nI will absolutely give it a second chance, but I fear Matt's might be one of those places people love because other people love it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here on a Thursday morning with the boyfriend to eat and was greeted by a girl who looked like she just got to work after a night out At the club. I couldn't decide what to eat from their huge menu of 7items. The night club waitress informed us that the eggs benidict was the special today. So we ordered one each. Low and behold the plate was 11dollars each. I wouldn't have minded paying that if the food was good but it wasn't. Small portions and incredibly salty. Just terrible! I couldn't even eat my food. I wouldn't even go back if someone paid me. Maybe the people there should pay more attention to the food instead of trying so had to be hipsters.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeeny Tiny little place with little room to breath inside. Food was just OK IMO.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we are in Phoenix  for business we tend to eat breakfast here. The food is yummy, the place is small and Matt tends to be around to say hey and help serve up the grub. I like the oatmeal of all things...my husband really likes the scrambles. I love that it's small and homey the food is good and it's not too pricey. Also, I love to give my business to ma and pa places as opposed to, say...IHOP or Denny's. (YUCK)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere and back again..\n\nWe ventured this morning to a great land called Phoenix (though today we shall call that Gondor) from our little Scottsdale burrow (we shall call that the Shire). The Shire has many wonderful things to offer so we don't venture to far. \n\nThere's been talk of a movement in the great land of Gondor.. this movement is called Slow Food. Were great humans feed others based on sustainable crops, dairy and meat. These humans try to whenever possible, use only locally grown ingredients. There was word of an outdoor market that believes in these philosophies and shares with all the locals there. So off to Gondor.  \n\nAfter an easy and painless journey we arrived at the great outdoor market to find that it wasn't open yet. A very small distance east of there were a few humans mulling around a classic Gondor building that looked to have been turned into some sort of eatery. Once inside we discovered a great man named Matt and his magical Big Breakfast! We were seated at a counter with many other hungry travelers. \n\nA fair maiden appeared.. she was so friendly and welcoming.. then took our orders.. the great man Matt had created something just for that day.. Salsa Verde Huevos Rancheros. The way the maiden pronounced these words we though for a moment she was speaking Elven.. only moments had passed and then set before us were 2 huge plates filled with roasted potatoes, 2 eggs over easy atop a corn tortilla covered in a green sauce. You see hobbits love good food, you can tell by their round bellies and lack of defined abs.. this was indeed a bountiful feast!  The fragrance arose from the plate and filled our nostrils.. we both stared into each others eyes then quickly began eating.. the flavors and textures were simply heavenly.. each better then the last! \n\nWe could see ourselves making the journey to Gondor quite often from the Shire.. we could see someday perhaps living in Gondor close to the outdoor market and of course the great Matt's Big Breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am going to make this review short and sweet..\n\nGreat food! I love the hashbrowns! I am big fan of the food!\n\nThe negative end of this place... the wait. Its a great place to take out of town guests or an occasional place to drop into every now and then. I don't think any place is worth waiting 45 minutes in the heat.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was pretty good, although watch what you order \" la carte\". It will add up FAST!\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast was good. Staff was great. Wait was long, if your really hungry bring a snack.. we ran errands while waiting. I would go again with people who haven't been, but mostly for the novelty of experiencing breakfast that you have to wait an hour for..\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't go if you are in a hurry but definitely go if you're really hungry. I went on a Saturday morning and waited about 45 minutes. The servers were really friendly and not pushy even though you know they have a line of people waiting outside. I had the griddlecakes and my (very picky) friend had the salami scramble which he devoured. The food was really good, but I wasn't floored like I expected from what I've heard. I will definitely return though, it's a fun place to take people who don't venture to Phoenix much from the suburbs or are from out of town.\n\n\n\n\n\nUgh!  I thought maybe I should try this place again before I slam it on Yelp, but after reading some of the other one- and two-star reviews, I realize I'm not nuts.  And there is no way I'm going to wait for hours to give this place another chance.  If you want to wait in line for two hours and then receive a cup of grease along with your hash browns and eggs, then Matt's is the place for you.  Disgusting!  Not to mention the bathroom is next door in a hotel room.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeppered bacon and sweet cream butter griddle cakes.  Mmmmm.  The griddle cakes get this nice little crispy edge on them.  Can I get a big woooooot wooooot!!!  MBB is an awesome LITTLE joint to stop at for breakfast.  I stress little because while the food is tall in stature, the place is small small small.  If you're going to go on the weekend, go early.  You probably have much less chance of a wait during the week.  \n\nDefinitely a hot spot for breakfast in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off I LOVE this place! I have never been disappointed with the food or service. If you love breakfast food this is your place. You have to try the Salami Scramble with home fries (which are the best damn potatoes this side of Idaho). \nAlso, if you're lucky the special of the day might be the eggs benedict that are making me hungry just thinking about them.\n\nIf you get there around 11:00 am be prepared to wait but they will seat you pretty fast. The customer service is great and the prices are cheap! Don't come here if you want a healthy breakfast because it won't be but it will be some of the best breakfast food you will ever have!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've sadly become one of those people who turn to the Food Network for restaurant recommendations. Okay, not all the time but when a segment airs about thick cut bacon and huge burger patties cooked in butter, I immediately start making travel plans.\n\nWe arrived at Matt's for a late-lunch. Being that it was a weekday and close to 2pm, the restaurant was nearly empty and we didn't have to endure the wait or the harried service. In fact, other than a mix-up with toast, the staff was attentive and eager to please (or get us out so they could go home).\n\nI ordered the jalapeno burger with kettle chips and Jules got the Hog & Chick - 2 eggs with bacon. Her hash browns were buttery and sweet. My burger was juicy with a nice kick.\n\nI don't know if I'll jump on the plane the next time I see a tempting food segment but am I glad that we made a trip for some bacon and burger? You bet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a case of high expectations falling short. After seeing it on a Food Network show and reading about it in numerous sources, I had high hopes for Matt's Big Breakfast. After waiting for 45 minutes, we made it inside the tiny restaurant.  \n\nEverything was ok, but nothing spectacular. I do appreciate their no microwave, no freezer rule, but I feel it didn't live up to the hype I had read/heard about. \n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by good Bay Area coffee options, but the coffee here was BAD. The salami scramble was pretty average and the Belgian waffle for which a lot of people rave about, was fine, but again, didn't stand out as amazing. The thick cut bacon was awesome and a nice accompaniment to the waffle. \n\nHowever, waiting for 45 minutes and feeling rushed to get out the door, just isn't worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI heard many people saying we should try Matt's Big Breakfast so we had to go.  This place is VERY small with very limited seating inside and no outside option when we were there.  We waited for about 45 minutes talking to people outside about how good it was.\n\nOnce seated, on the window bar stools, we were promptly greeted.  Service was good if not abrupt and to the point.  The portions were a good size, but there are bigger out there for sure.  \n\nOur food was good but nothing great as we had been hearing.  This is NOT worth the wait if you ask me, but I would go there as a neighborhood staple if no more than a 10 minute wait. \n\nFor my $ and time, I'm going to Farm House in Gilbert if I had a choice, now THAT PLACE is worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, it was 7:22 a.m. on the first Saturday of 2008 when we walked into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The place was maybe half full when we were taken to a table for two with a seat on the side.  A friendly waiter came by for drink orders; I went with apple juice but was later informed they were out.  The whole order went a little something like this, 2 coffees, 1 milk, 1 waffle, 1 cakes, and 1 special of ham eggs green chili and cheese scramble.  I hear the coffee was drinkable.  The waffle and pancakes had somewhat of a buckwheat taste but not sure if that is what they actually were.  I am a huge fan of Belgium waffles and found myself terribly disappointed.  I see a Belgium waffle as having a slight crisp of an edge and a soft center.  This waffle was very soft with no crisp and almost like a moist sponge.  The special was not the best and the pancakes seemed pretty heavy.  The home fries seemed like they were cooked in bacon grease and maybe sat there too long.  I did like the small quaint feel of the restaurant.  All of the staff was very friendly and worked together.  People of all styles came for breakfast, there were regulars, people in a hurry for the airport, couples, families, singles, people of all kinds.  They all were all asked, \"How is the food?\"  They all seemed to enjoy.  At the places prime they could probably seat 24 people, give or take.  I will probably not be one of them, but I am glad I was one once.\n\n\n\n\n\nwas in town for spring training walking around one morning looking for a bite to eat and ran into this gem because i saw a line outside and decided if people are waiting this long to get a seat it must be good as to be a reason for the wait and i was not dissapointed i had the special of the day which was eggs benedict with thick cut pieces of ham and a most excellent hollandaise and i destroyed it so much flavor my mouth was doing backflips wish i could have tried so much more on their menu but thats gives me another reason to visit beautiful phoenix again so next time u see a line outside of this place or any for that reason dont run away because there has to be a reason people are waiting to get inside and matts will not\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here with a friend after he saw it recommended by Guy Fieri on the food network. It's a true dive; it can only fit about 25 people, your really never going to avoid a long wait and it's nothing special on the inside.\n\nThat aside, the food is RIDICULOUS. The butter burger is easily the best burger I've ever had. It's incomparable. I got a side of country fries which were also insanely delicious and tried the waffles which were unmatched in quality. They actually added a slight seasoning to the waffles which give it a nice touch to the sweetness.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt's on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall \"amazing\" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........\n\nDon't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using \"local\" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. \n\nThe hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take \"over easy\" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. \n\nAll in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that's not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V.................\n\n\n\n\n\nI wish I could give 31/2 stars...\n\nFirst of all...just check this place out and decide for yourself- that is if  you don't die of heat stroke while waiting in the 110 degree summer sweatfest that is most notably Phoenix. Or better yet just thank Matt once you make it inside for not bothering to accommodate patrons with some type of effing shading device!!!!! PLANT SOME TREES!!!! UMBRELLAS!!!! OVER HANG! PATIO! A GUY U PAY $3.35/hr WITH A HUGE PIECE OF CARDBOARD! ANYTHING! ok..you get the point. \n(I understand this setup in any other state people, but seriously....!) and btdubs..the outside is just fugly...trees plz!\n\nblah blah blah... once you make it inside everything is great! Simple, basic food, friendly service, quaint atmosphere, decent prices. Yeah you could make it at home, but you can make any breakfast food at home, that is the point of \"going out\" for breakfast.\n\n*TIP! call ahead and order and then eat while you walk to your car! superkewl time saver DOH!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had their belgian waffle, which came with bacon and advertised real cream butter and real maple syrup. Also got orange juice and my girlfriend got a salami-egg scramble thing.\n\nThe lady's salami-egg scramble was great (and a new taste!) but my waffle was THE BEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I sipped my tiny $2.50 (I think) orange juice and FELL OFF MY CHAIR, AMAZED BY THE DELICIOUSLY SWEET FRESH SQUEEZED OJ.\n\nAfter being revived by my frantic girlfriend, I quickly JUMPED UP AND HUGGED EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE BUILDING.\n\nTrue story.\n\nWe went at 1:30 PM on a Sunday and sat right down-- your mileage may vary as this place is apparently legendary and I hear can attract quite a crowd when busy. There's like 10 small tables in the whole place plus a bar, and virtually no parking, and no shade, so don't expect to be catered to (outside of delicious food.)\n\nAlso, Matt has inspired a new invention: fresh squeezed orange juice shots. Seriously, I'd buy a few if they existed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere isn't much I can say that hasn't been said so I'll be fast and say stuff that possibly hasn't been addressed.\n-A big minus for me, the menu online is outdated.  Add two dollars to the price of everything.  Also the portions seemed to have shrunk a bit from whenever pictures here were taken.\n-There is only one 4-top, everything else is 2-top or counter, so plan accordingly.  We got there early and put our name on the list despite the agonizing taunt of all those empty 2-tops.  The bf was a little grumpy the waitress didn't put 2 tables together, but admitted there really wasn't room to do that without blocking a path.\n-The decor is cute and Ikea-esque.  Very clean and bright, I felt like I was in a Real Simple spread.\n-The blueberry jam tastes like normal blueberry jam.  It's cute and nice to get in a cup instead of a package, but otherwise not special.\n-I ordered bacon because everyone said the bacon was amazing, even though the sausage looked really good.  My bacon was thick-cut but burned and not particularly tasty regardless of doneness.\n-They cooked my eggs over medium!  I always ask and usually get over easy anyway.  I appreciate the effort, maybe he was concentrating and accidentally burned my bacon.\n-The home fries have a LOT of rosemary, so don't get it if you're not a big fan.  It perfumed the whole plate and the leaves soaked in the oil seeped into everything.  I liked it.\n-Don't come here if you want a quiet, private breakfast experience.  The guy sitting behind us seemed grouchy as soon as he was seated and spent the meal glaring at my in-laws, presumably for speaking loudly over the restaurant noise (like everyone else).  He made a lot of pointed throat-clearing and loud newspaper rustling that seemed to embarrass the crap out of his wife and perplex patrons around us.  I really don't know what we did, but don't be this guy.\n\n\n\n\n\nButtery Buttery Buttery...YUMMY!\n\nAfter dealing with the WRONG way on 7th (thanks for nothing Yahoo! maps), we were now super duper hungry...and secretly, I need breakfast within 30 minutes of waking up. I knew there could be a weekend wait and with some toast in my belly I braved the hot noon sun. Located next to a sketchy hotel/residence space (hash browns AND heroin!), this small space is DAMN small. A nice walkway with cacti and rustic fence create a lil space, and dumps you into the counterspace/dining room. First impression-this place is WHITE-I mean, like the walls are white, the counter is, the seats are re-upholstered vintage chrome stools white, but the tables are a beautful blood orange formica-oh yeah, I like that...with lil' orange gerber daisies. Like so, cute.\n\nWe thought about sitting at the counter, but with a chance for shortie chairs, we went next to the window that actually gave a promising look of artsy downtown PHX-def. added to the experience instead of what I would consider a dreaded smooshed in one in the small room in the back (is that where bad people go to eat eggs?). After some confusion over why one would need water AND iced tea, I got to sample their coffee and orange juice. Man, I LOVED that orange juice-simply the best. And the coffee was good black, always a test of quality. The menu is small and due to the lack of veggies with the breakfast (does cheese count as a veggie?), I went with sweet instead of savoury. I got the belgian waffle (an option of fruit would have taken this to a whole 'nother level, btw) and WOW-but-ter-ry. I think made with real buttermilk too. With butter melting on top. Was the maple syrup made with butter too? Possible. I think maybe all of Matts Big Breakfast may be made of butter...mmmmm. It was so rich I really had to leave one lone piece on my plate. I could not eat it. Really. COULD NOT-immediate expulsion from the clean plate club. Totally ashamed of my inability for the MBB money shot.\n\nNice asides: \nThe taters are with caramelized onions and rosemary sprigs-HOLLA.\nI asked to have the bacon substituted with the afore-mentioned, and the waitress said that wasn't possible-but she did deduct buck and some change from the price of the waffle, which as a veggie I deeply appreciate-CLASSY\nParking lot and parking on street.\n\nBonus: Cute children will linger around your table and smile, much like nervous men at bars with bottles instead of beers, and not say much, making your experience alternate between unbearably cute and creepy.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ADORE this place. Matt's has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed! Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, \"I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch.\" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWake up in the morning, food was on my  mind. Whats a good place to eat? \"Heard the food portion at Matt's was astronomical!\" Asked myself, Am I really that hungry? Yes, Yes I AM! \n\nKnowing that a trendy brunch place like this would attract a lot of locals and travelers. I had mentally prepped myself to wait an hour. But who knew Matt's big breakfast would be contained in such a small place. I had waited almost 90 minutes to be seated. Good thing it was breezy that day, or it woulda been pretty intense wait.\n\nOnce seated, pretty much knew exactly what I wanted to order until I saw the special. 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese. Sounds amazing. Got an order of that and an order of the Hog & Chick w/ hash browns.\n\nThe 3 egg scramble\nDefinitely prettier dish of those 2. The presentation was definitely on point, the plate was full of fluffy eggs with melted fontina cheese on top. The rest of the plate was filled up with the country fries(potato). The bed of baby spinach added contrast to the plate. A dish that pleases the eye as much as the tongue. The andouille sausage/egg/fontina cheese was good combo. The flavor of all 3 really worked together, instead of fighting each other.\n\nHog & Chick w/ hash browns\nThis one was less aesthetically pleasing. But don't let looks fool  you. This piece of pork chop is mighty tasty. The hash was real good. They browned both sides of the hash, and added some other stuff. It was tasty and had good consistency. Wish the chop was a thicker cut. I'd pay more for a thicker cut.\n\nEverything here tasted good, and stood out from other diners. It was not expensive at all. But good food from a small place like that just means a long wait in line to be seated. I think they do take out. So'd recommend take out or showing up early.  But if I had to wait in line again, I would totally do it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think Matt's has had its '5 minutes of fame'.  Note to owners: Your food is good enough,  your staff is great, so please save your money and move to a better location.  Right now, you're next to a rundown hotel with police baracade tape all over the place.The local residents(?) pan-handling all the waiting customers outside your place. Seriously?   Just sad.  Won't go again, won't recommend it either.  Good luck this summer, the heat will melt all your 'waiting area' customers out .\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a cute place.  Believe me, the place is small but the breakfast is big.   \n\nIt is a tiny dwelling and I can't imagine the wait time during their peak business hour but talk about helping the little guy out and everyone there was pleasant and most importantly the food was great.  I want to try everything there when I return.\n\nBTW, they had the best tasting hash browns I've ever had.... Thinly sliced and well done.....Just the way I ordered it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm an avid food network watcher, and heard about this little breakfast joint from both Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and Phoenix Magazine's \"Best Of\" issue. I'd actually tried it once before last summer and been only mildly impressed...To read about the experience that changed my mind, visit my food blog:\n\nhttp://eatinganddrinkingacrosstheusa.blogspot.com/2011/07/downtown-phoenix-az.html\n\n\n\n\n\nDrove all the way from long beach california for this joint, and it was totally worth the drive. I got the waffle with bacon and a side of of rosemary potatoes. it was amazing and the best breakfast i have ever eaten. Every time i go to AZ i will eat here amazing!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy oh why must you be so tiny and have such good food, Matt's? It's some of the best breakfast I've ever had but it's still not worth waiting an hour. One time I woke up randomly at 6:30 on Sunday and went over there just in time not to wait for a ridiculous amount of time. That was nice. It almost motivates me to wake up early more often. Everything I've tried I've loved, including the waffle, pancakes, omelets and hashbrowns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally made it to Matt's for breakfast.  I had to check out the hype and see if it is what everyone says it is!  I took my nieces with me and I wasn't sure if it was very kid friendly...let's say I wouldn't bring young ones there just because it is so small and there is no room to run around.  But since my gals are 10 and 11 there was no problem accommodating them.  They split the delicious belgian waffle.  Let me tell you this is the tastiest I have ever tried!!  Real maple syrup is the key and they serve the best.  All piping hot and fresh off the griddle (my mouth waters just thinking of it).  I ordered the egg sandwich with no bacon, so it was a fried egg with american cheese and sauteed onions.  Not the healthiest option but I really enjoyed it.  I am not sure what kind of bread it was on but it was soft and fantastic.  The fresh squeezed OJ is like eating a ripe orange and the coffee was very well made.  All in all I can see why people are willing to wait for a long time to eat here.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest waffle ever! Cute atmosphere, you can tell he loves what he does! Good job, Matt\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply the best place in Arizona for breakfast!\n\nMatt's does absolutely everything right.  No freezers in the back, fresh produce from the market, and quality ingredients all the way around shows just how amazing independent restaurants can be.\n\nThe obvious bad about Matt's is the wait.  There are few breakfast places that don't have a wait on Saturday or Sunday morning and Matt's is no exception.  The problem is, however, due to the limited capacity, the wait can become excessive.  I've never waited more than 90 minutes (that was with a group of 5) but when you are hungry, 20 minutes can seem like an hour.  \n\nIf you can occupy yourself with a Kontakt or the Farmers Market long enough to stick around, the rewards are great.  Wonderful, quaint diner setting filled with bright white and orange walls and counters.  An intimate setting where you can be sure you will interact with at least someone else during your meal.  \n\nThe food is great and I have yet to be disappointed.  I usually just order the Special, whatever it may be.  It makes it easier than trying to decide.  The Five Spot is another favorite of mine - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich that is top quality.  The wife always orders the hog and chick (meat and eggs).  The best part of every breakfast is the hashedbrowns that are cooked in butter and better than you've ever had them.\n\nThe workers are sweet and full of personality.  Matt sometimes stops in to drop off milk or eggs or to say Hi to his wife.  She is usually running around making sure everything goes smoothly.  \n\nDo not let the wait deter you.  Go to Matt's.  Take every one of your visiting relatives and friends to Matt's.  Make a special trip from the far east or west valley to go to Matt's.  Just don't do it the day that I go.\n\n\n\n\n\nI must say that this place was pretty darned good. They open at 6:30 AM on Sunday and there was already a line. The whole place was full upon the doors opening, great sign. They have a very small menu but it certainly covers all of your breakfast needs.\n\nI opted for three sides, a pancake, rosemary homestyle potatoes and rye toast with jam. I asked my waitress which to order, the hashbrowns or the homestyle potatoes and she steered me towards my final choice. I'm glad I listened to her as they were delicious, covered with onions, olive oil and rosemary, the were cooked perfectly. They were some of the freshest potatoes I've had for breakfast in a long time. They weren't greasy at all. I felt like I had just gone to the Farmers' Market, chopped these up and cooked them myself for a Sunday brunch at home.\n\nThe pancake was good, nothing outside the ordinary. You can tell by the photo that there wasn't too much love in making it. For some reason the syrup was very good, I'm not quite sure what they used, it was a pancake syrup but obviously not the generic diner variety. The rye and jam were fantastic, just look at how thick the slice was cut, I've never seen a rye like that. I wish other places would serve their breads like this. I'd be a huge fan of any place that cut their slices in this manner.\n\nI would certainly go out of my way to eat here again. The staff were terrific, the place was spotless, the owner walked around and spoke with all diners (it seemed like everyone was a local) and the food was great. The prices have risen, at least since their website has been in place but it's still a good deal (the $5 Spot is now $5.75). A great place to grab a Big Breakfast in a nice atmosphere.\n\nI have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm just piling on at this point, but Matt's is as good as it gets.  Reminds me of big homemade farmboy breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't see what the hype is about. Food was good, bacon was incredible but I won't make the 20 minute drive back and 20-30 minute wait to eat there again. Also, not a good spot to bring kids.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to try the place out after seeing it on food network's diners, drive in, and dives.  I thought it was pretty good but my wife did not like it becasue it was to greasy. she did not like the butter fat.  We did have to wait a long time to eat.  It's small and they had a lot of flies in the windows which was a big turn off.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't even know what the hell I had because it was soooo dang good that I ate it all and went into a food-itis coma instantly.  Nah just kidding about the memory but totally serious about the food coma.  We checked this place out on an off day and it was still pretty populated.  Breakfast anytime CAN NOT BEAT THAT!!!  My bro and I got the the same platter which was the special of the day.  Linguisa with sourdough toast, hash browns, home fries, eggs, homemade preserves!!!  Everything was SPECTACULAR!  Like seriously!!!  It was a very homey and neighborhood feel to the restaurant with super excellent service.  Ninja water and coffee refills, great timing and check ups!  I think that it was part of our server as well but she was magnificent as well.  The overall experience was really enjoyable and I'll definately be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there was any place in town that is worth getting up at 6am on a Saturday to get in line for breakfast food, this is it. Everything I've had here is amazing and worth the wait as everyone else said. \n\nThe ingredients are local, the staff is friendly and the setting compact. Not a place I would try to to bring a group larger than 4 to though so if you have a large group, pick out the 3 others you like the most and ditch the rest! ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure why everyone loves this place.  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve.  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there's not one...and no, I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me, Matt.\n\n\n\n\n\nWife took me to breakfast this morning. My daughter told us to try this place. So here we are at around 8:30 AM and the place is busy. Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table...beats waiting an hour on the weekends. If your a twosome, you have a faster chance of getting a table.\nI had their Salami Scramble with hash browns and sour dough. My wife had the Hog & Chick with home fries and sour dough. \nThe last time I had soppresata salami was when I was a kid. The dish was great as long as you're a salami lover. It just brought back great memories as a teenager in North Beach in San Francisco eating a salami sandwich on a hard roll for lunch. \nThe hash browns were a little over cooked, but hey, they were hash browns.\nOne other thing, the sour dough was actually sliced from a loaf of sour dough bread which came with homemade jam.\nWe will return.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've lived downtown for 5 years now and never heard of this place until I saw it on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'...\n\nJust kidding. I'm a semi-regular. I say \"semi\" because I go in series. I'll go four or five times in a two week period and then have to lay off and hit the gym to work off the 20 pounds I gained. But I keep going back.\n\nMatt uses a lot of butter when he cooks, which makes everything taste better. The fresh made pancakes and waffles are awesome with real maple syrup. The pork chop and eggs is a delightfully dangerous breakfast, marinated in a homemade pesto sauce (the porkchop, that is - who marinates eggs?). The thick cut bacon strips are great for breakfast and even better in the BLT (which I sometimes order with a fried egg on it for breakfast, a BELT).\n\nIt looks as though most people are saying this is a '$' place but I would give it '$$'. I have yet to leave there with a bill under $10.\n\nSome complain about the wait but I have and answer for that - don't go if you're in a hurry. If you go on a weekend, bring an iPod or something to read while you're waiting.\n\n\n\n\n\nYUMMY breakfast spot! Matt and his wife are super nice and the food is excellent. Tried the porkchop breakfast and it was soo good. Even Guy Fierri from foodnetwork thinks its the best breakfast he's ever had! \n\nThe restaurant is really tiny but didn't wanna take away a star for that cuz its definitely worth the wait. The homefries are reallly good too and you get that on the side with almost every dish anyway. =)\n\n\n\n\n\nAn absolutely wonderful breakfast.  I had the special...hot peppers with scrambled eggs.  Couldn't have been better.  Matt's Big Breakfast is a small spot, but I understand they are moving to bigger quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\nI loved this place. Its super tiny but the food comes out pretty quickly and they turn tables fast. I ordered the special which had eggs, ham, Fresno peppers, and cheese and came with hashbrowns. Everything was absolutely delicious. Their toast, as well, was a huge highlight. We didn't wait long because we called beforehand and were put on the list. They don't really have a host/hostess, you just write your name on the list, which I found interesting. I spent most of the meal gawking at one of their employees, Travis, who was absolutely adorable. I wish they had eggs benedict, but the food they had definitely made up for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe just landed from kc, we were hungry and wet from the rain.  A 20 minute wait and a good table, my birthday got brighter.  The bacon was extra crispy and the orange juice had bits of real orange.  Service was quick and organized.  The place is small, but clean & bright.  If you are ever there when they have the three meat scramble with eggs, spicy peppers & cheese- get it!  My partner ordered this & I had food envy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place lives up to it's hype. I had the waffles w/ thick cut bacon and hash browns, the flavors discovered my lost taste buds. The bacon has this special seasoning that goes nicely on it. One of the best hash browns I ever had. Long wait but worth it, the waiters are average they all work together which they try very hard to speed things up. 4.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was our first visit to this restaurant. First, let me say that this restaurant has awesome fresh squeezed orange juice, excellent coffee, and great service. The food was generally good. Ham was tough in spots, and my meal was definitely in need of salt and pepper.The port in my breakfast special had no taste at all. Hashbrowns were somewhat burnt. I could live with this though. However, I had to mark this restaurant down due to the lack of comfort of the \"urban\" stainless steel stools that are provided to customers at the counters. Here I think style was a major concern over comfort, and I urge the owners in this eatery to sit on their own stools for an hour to experience the whole dining experience. While eating there, I spent most of the time trying not to slide off of these quite small, hard and slippery shiny stainless steel wonders, and since no rail to rest your feet on is provided, staying on them depends on you using the small rails along the bottom of the stool to try and stay on them. By the end of the meal, we couldn't wait to get out of there, just so we could stand up and stretch out our backs from the lack of support, hardness, and strain of trying to stay on these little torture devices. If the idea is to make it uncomfortable enough to keep the turnover quick at the counters, then they are perfectly suited for the task. However, we will strongly reconsider whether to return, and if we do, will never sit at the counter again. Good food is available all over the valley, and being comfortable while eating is also available all over the valley. \n\nAs a suggestion to attract and keep customers, I want to make a couple of suggestions:\n\nFix the stool situation. They are a big drawback.\n\nDuring the breakfast wait, instead of that watery whatever it is that you offer to all the people waiting outside (water? lemonade?), serve coffee. When the guy brought that out, many of us said \"Coffee, awesome!\", and then realized it was something far less appealing. By bringing out coffee and mugs (OK to use a variety from Goodwill or whatever), you will have an automatic coffee sale and people will enjoy hanging out while waiting. You can stage it from inside to control losses and offer it to those on the waiting list if you want, but it would endear a customer such as myself to the restaurant. \n\nWhen you put down the check, explain how it works. \"We can take care of this for you or you can pay at the counter\" would be helpful. We weren't sure what to do and had to ask.\n\nAs it is, we may or may not return to this restaurant. Might give it one more try.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, I have to admit I'm a secret admirer of Matt's delicious ever so crunchy, thick and well seasoned bacon!! Bacon, Bacon, Bacon is what keeps me coming back to Matt's Big Breakfast and of course their pancakes, pork chops, omelets, hash browns, home fries...\n\nThis place is small as many Yelpers have stated already and no thanks to Guy and his \"Triple D\" it's hard to find the right time to come to Matt's with out having to wait due to all the foodie followers of Food Network.  \n\nThe service at Matt's is what you make of it. If your in a rush, let your server know and she will accommodate you, but if you don't say anything you'll wait for refills. \n\nAs many Yelpers have already stated their food is amazing!  Matt uses the freshest ingredients, most of which are organic and locally grown.  I had something not on their normal menu: scrambled eggs with sliced chorizo, jalapeos and cheesy goodness with a side of their hash browns, toast and of course bacon!  It was FANTASTIC! Great combination and it wasn't spicy at all!  Ask for it when you go, you must try it!! They bacon and chorizo are made special for Matt at a market.  He uses Wildflower's bread and the egg and veggies are all from local farmers.\n\nRecommendation:  Stacy C is right, the best time to come is during the week and in the early or late morning.  Plan a business breakfast in lieu of a luncheon.  We went last week and the three of us had problem finding a table, be it a small table : -)\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Matt's after checking on Yelp when we landed at Phoenix airport.  It seemed like a nice place to eat based on the reviews.\nThe restaurant is very small and located on an unassuming street corner just south of downtown.  Free parking is difficult to find so bring change for parking meters that are in abundance.  We arrived at around 9 in the morning and it was already warm, and yes there is a wait outside.  There is also not much shade other than a couple of umbrellas and the overhang.  I can't imagine really long waits.  By the way, don't go inside to sign up.  You put your name on a note pad outside of the door and they'll come out to get you when it is your turn.  Our wait on an off-day was about 15-20 minutes.  (Update:  Looks like they have moved).\n\nThe room for us inside was counter-seating next to the register.  It was a tad bit cramped and we didn't have a lot of space to wiggle since we were dealing with servers passing by us constantly.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  All the servers seemed like they were college co-eds but they did not lack any kind of customer service quality.  They buzzed around with purpose and had no problems with menus, rude customers, or getting around the cramped quarters of the establishment.  \n\nThe food is excellent.  We shared a three egg omelet with chicken apple sausage and local hot peppers that was one of the best I've tasted.  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious, and the side of pepper bacon complemented everything perfectly.  The star of the meal is the home fries; an amalgamation of potatoes, buttery goodness, and rosemary.  They are scrumptious beyond belief.  \n\nOverall the experience at Matt's was excellent, and maybe the new building will allow for better parking and less wait time.  And while the food was outstanding, the conditions for waiting, the parking, and the cramped spaces inside only warrant 4 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have a new location just up the street from the old one and this one has BATHROOMS - YEAH!!\nFood here is AS GOOD AS IT GETS, you can't find better food in this town AT ANY PRICE.  We are huge fans, love that BIG BUTTER BURGER and the GRIDDLE CAKES.  We drive 100 miles round trip to get this food and it's WORTH it.\nCongrats, Erenia and Matt - LOVE the new place!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat classic breakfasts, nothing fancy but very fresh and very good. I'm coming back!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo freezer in the joint so when they run out of OJ they have to literally go and buy more oranges!  The food is fresh and homeade.  I haven't been to their newest location which I hear is much larger inside to accomodate the massive breakfast crowds.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood occasion get some friends together who are virgin Matt's BB goers and we waited about 40 min for our table which ultimately wasn't too bad as we got seated in the private VIP nook at the front of their newly located establishment. The decor was plain and simple and service was top notch as our water was always topped up. I went for brekkie with the hog and chick and hubby did the BLT and our other two friends also went with lunch. \n\nSomehow I remembered that the hashbrowns were better than what I dined on today, there was a slight bitter/sour slant to them and I was a bit put off, perhaps too over buttered for my taste today, however thick cut slice bacon saved the day as usual. \n\nAll in all the company was priceless and we will likely stick to eating near our place as it is a trek.\n\n\n\n\n\nway overrated! bathroom in the kitchen, gross!  know what you're eating!  how much was the oj again?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food tastes amazing. I don't want to know how much butter they used to make my waffle, but I sure made it disappear. The staff is intelligent, friendly and efficient. There is sometimes a wait to eat here, but they have a waiting list and try to get new customers in quickly. I have eaten here twice this school semester (it's very close to the ASU downtown Phoenix campus) and I keep talking new classmates into going back with me. The ingredients are fresh and very high quality. No wonder they were featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive- ins and Dives. Yum! Try the omelet, it's my favorite.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile waiting outside, the fresh smell of BACON & waffles are waffling thru the air on the patio. There's a bird whistling a happy tune while the patrons come in and out of this small red brick building. When you cross the threshold to the other side, you are greeted the the diner atmosphere to the smell of fresh bacon.\n\nFreshly squeezed OJ & lemonade are on the menu w/ the freshest ingredients known to man kind.. Hence due to the caption on the back of the menu with the smell of waffle & bacon waffling around my senses. \n\n-Did I mention the smell of bacon? ..probably Ooh three or four times already. That's how good it smells while tantalizing my sense of smell.\n\nI can't wait to get in the door to the kingdom that's is Matt's.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it's been a personal quest to try the restaurants on Guy's shows. Matt's Big breakfast was one of those places. By the sight of the long line outside the restaurant at 1230, I had big hopes for this place! We sat down and were greeted with water from a waitress who was dressed for the gym or a booty dance in her too short too tight too small shorts. \n\nThe meal-\n1) breakfast sandwich. Very tasty! The peppered bacon made the dish.\n2) famous has browns- crispy outside but the inside was a mushy mash consistency\n3) griddle cakes- fluffy and light, but nothing to write home about. \n\nService- we asked one of the waiters for an extra plate to share. He brought one with dried omelet residue on, put it on our table, saw the same leftover meal we saw, then proceeded to scrap it off with his nail, then put it back on our table. I didn't know what to do but laugh at the awkward experience, at which the same waiter rushed back and asked if that plate was okay. Oh boy...\n\nOverall good but wouldn't wait again for it\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband surprised me with breakfast take-out here a few weekends ago and I was a giggling mess. I had the perma-grin waiting for him to get back with my favorite item, the Salami Scramble. It is scrambled eggs mixed with sliced salami, with their awesome thick toast and your choice of hashbrowns or home fries. The jelly they give with the toast is delicious, as well. I can't say I am a huge fan of the potatoes as both the home fries and hashbrowns tend to be really greasy. That's okay, though, because the rest of the food is great. They also have thick-cut bacon you can order on the side that is pretty wonderful. I have eaten in the restaurant, sometimes, and I never had to wait too long and usually the wait seems to go by fast. Inside, the service is pretty efficient which at times can seem like they are pushing you out. But everyone is really friendly. I love that the farmer's market is right across the street which is great if you want to get out and have a nice breakfast before hitting the market. Matt's is closed on Mondays, FYI. Don't be like me trying to hit it up on a Monday off and throwing the collossal temper-tamptrum in the parking lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong Long Long Long Long Long Long wait, for average food. I remember saying to myself \"We'll this was not worth the wait\" the entire time I was eating. If I knew I could get a seat right away, I might frequent this place. Otherwise, I am not wasting my entire morning waiting on a meal that I could make at home in 1/8 the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was sooooo disappointed!  I really cannot rate the food as I never got to eat. I live in Tucson and my family is mostly in the east  valley of Phoenix and I have been waiting for 2 years to go into downtown and eat at Matt's. I go and put my name on the waiting list. Other parties of 2 come after me and the guy kept sitting people that had been there for 20-30 minutes and I had been waiting exactly 1 hour. What really upset me is that I saw him seat 3 people at tables for 2 and when I walked in said he couldn't sit 3 there when there were others seated that way (i think he knew them).  I am truly disappointed as I've been waiting like I said for \"2\" years to eat there. If you have a party of more than 2, like a mere 3, you'll wait forever!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Matt's big breakfast. I don't go there all the time. But any place that makes me drive a pretty good distance and wait in line just for breakfast! Must be doing something right. Went there this morning with my girlfriend. And we was greeted by a cute and very intelligent kid that was the owners son. Didn't have to wait to long but it was a nice day. I always get the griddlecakes when I go there. Ive never had anything even close to there's anywhere else. I can't give it 5 stars because of the wait and because its pretty small in there. And its always kind of weird eating breakfast next to a big window where people who are waiting outside can sit there and stare at you. I feel like im on display at a zoo eating. But those are minor gripes. I go to Matts for the food and the food never disappoints.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're at all a \"Foodie\" you can't come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.\n\nFood....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently. \n\nThis was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.\n\nSide note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's worth the wait just for the orange juice - but the food is good too.\n\nThe boys went camping, so my daughter and I woke up early and headed downtown for the farmer's market and some breakfast. We stopped at Matt's long enough to put our name on the list and then ventured across the street to meander through all the local wares. We took our time and when we came back, we met and visited a couple of moms who had brought their daughters all the way from Calgary to try this place. (wow)\n\nHere's what we figured out about the wait: it's about 30-40 minutes per page of names ahead of you... (ish) Two pages of names ahead of us when we signed in = 1 hour 10 minutes total wait on the day we went.\n\nOnce inside, I loved the quaintness of the place ( and our service was superb. It's also obvious that they recognize people who have been in before and sometimes even know their names.\n\nBeing somewhat indecisive, we ordered the cheese omelet and the belgian waffle and shared. The omelet had just the right amount of cheese, making it a perfect accompaniment to the oh-my-gosh! fabulous wheat toast with locally made strawberry preserves. The hashbrowns were nothing to get excited about, but in the nirvana of the previously mentioned last bite, who cares?!?\n\nBut wait. Then I tried the waffle.\n\nOne of my best friends and I make waffles all the time - and have been making them for years. She's know for hers. I'm really sorry, dear friend, but Matt's has you beat. Their belgian is the ultimate experience of amazingness with just the right combination of being fluffy without being soggy. Add the 100% maple syrup and I'm good... so very very good. There's no need for the sweet cream butter - but it's there if you want it.\n\nIf they could pick the perfect orange at the moment of ultimate ripeness and squeeze it into a glass, you might be able to imagine the essence of every sip of the juice we drank. Just for kicks, we ordered the honey lemonade. Not really a breakfast beverage, but a must have for when we go back for lunch.\n\nGo knowing that you will wait and that it will be worth every minute. Definitely looking forward to going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I Ate\n- waffle\n- bacon\n- 2 scrambled eggs\n- hashbrowns\n- glass of milk\n\nWould I Go Again?\nYes--I had a fantastic breakfast at Matt's.  I asked the waitress what are the most popular items on the menu, and one of the items she listed was the waffle.  The waffle was so good!  The batter was great, it was cooked perfectly, and the sweet cream butter and maple syrup completed the waffle's deliciousness.  The hashbrowns are my all-time favorite hashbrowns!  No competition.  The eggs were good (hard to go wrong with scrambled eggs), and the thick bacon was delicious.  Big thanks to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives for helping me find this little gem in Phoenix!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for the first time this week.  I don't stand in line for eggs, so went for lunch.  REALLY good chili.  There wasn't a wait at lunch time mid week.  It's noisy, so it's best for a casual, catching up with friends lunch- not for 'business'.  I would go again.\n\n\n\n\n\nMidwestern hipster breakfast of champions - that's how I would describe it in 5 words.  \n\nGood down-home breakfast, but not for weight watchers.   Bright orange formica counters and rooster orange juice glasses.  Love that the place is smaller than a shoebox.  It means you have wait ahead of you, but it keeps the breakfast experience a friendly intimate one. \n\nThe hog and chick is what I usually order. But most recently I've been ordering the sopressata salami scramble with provolone and the five spot breakfast sandwich.  The burger buns are a lackluster choice, but the grilled onions and thick peppercorn bacon slices more than make up for it.  The hash browns can be a bit greasy, but hey, that's what happens when you cook with butter.  \n\nCan be a wait on weekend, but worth it in central Phoenix, especially when the Good Egg and other places get old.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn our trip to AZ we had to stop by here. We wanted to dine in, but on our way to the airport it only made sense to bring the food back to the place we were staying at since we had yet to pack. This place brings the traditional simplicity of breakfast back to the kitchen table.\n\nWe opted for the \"Hog & Chick\" and Griddlecakes. Both were delicious and very filling. Simple breakfast made with that home made touch. We were glad we stopped by here before we headed back home. On top of the food, the service was amazing and friendly, and the bill was not a big dent in the wallet either. Overall an amazing experience with Matt's. We will definitely be back for our next trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat cup of coffee, best waffle I've ever had, got there just in time to beat (most of) the breakfast rush. My husband got a steak & eggs special. I loved that their water glasses are recycled jelly jars, coincidentally the kind we purchase and now we will be using at home. I can't wait to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was specifically looking for a good breakfast place in Phoenix. The concierge suggested Matt's Big Breakfast. I looked at some yelp reviews and figured I'd give it a try. I took the light rail over from my hotel and got off too soon and ended up doing a bit of walking in 100 degree weather. The place was small, had air conditioning, and I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait, even though the reviews said otherwise. I was by myself and able to sit at the counter right away! I ordered the belgian waffle, which had sweet cream butter, sprinkled with powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side. It was served with a side of thick cut bacon, which I have never tasted like this before - it was peppered and tasted really good! I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs. Let me tell you, the food was good - I ate my entire breakfast! The staff was very friendly too. As I was paying and getting ready to leave, I noticed a stamp of Guy Fieri's face on the wall! This place had been featured on the Food Network and I had no idea - usually I look up where he goes or places featured on Man vs. Food. I'd say stop in and check it out if you're in the area!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is always on wait, but well worth your time. After being discovered by Diners, Drive in and Dives, this place is jam packed. I love their pancakes and peppered bacon. MMM...my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Yum!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review is NOT for the food, it is for the wait.  Seriously.... 2 hours PLUS.  \nWe sat in the hot Arizona sun with my hungry child in a questionable part of town and the only thing I received was a sun burn and major irritation from the wait.\nAfter waiting 2 hours, that was it for us.  \n*************************My philosophy is anything tastes pretty damn amazing when you are famished and dehydrated. ********************\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Place: \nAfter reading many of the hundreds of reviews talking about the size of Matt's, I was still surprised when I pulled up with my family and the restaurant was the building that looked like a small shed.  LOL.  Forget small, the place is micro.  It has a bit of an urban chic/diner-vibe, but there is nothing to the appearance that would make someone ooh and aah.  Our table was two tables for two, butted together with two chairs facing the window/wall, and the other two facing each other, an odd, but space saving layout.  We were in the first room where there is also a tall bar to sit and eat, however that bar is also part of the \"list\".\n\nThe Food:\nI ordered the Hog & Chick with scrambled eggs, bacon, wheat toast, and home fries.  The bacon was as good as most have commented, a little sweet, smokey, and peppery.  The wheat toast was thick-cut and super grainy and served with raspberry lavender jam, both super.  The eggs were fresh, but just scrambled eggs.  In my opinion the highlight of my dish was the home fries - these potatoes were cut into chunks and fried with fresh rosemary twigs and onions.  I thought I needed ketchup for them, not hardly.  My wife tried the pancakes and wasn't particularly impressed, nor was I when I tried a bite.  They were okay, just not amazing.  Since there is no kids menu (which is an oversight in my mind) my older daughter ordered the waffle.  It smelled great, and she polished it off before I could get a taste.  I thought it looked good - and she said it tasted great.  Nice touch is that both waffles and pancakes come with REAL & VERY HOT maple syrup.  My other monkey, er daughter, had the Hog & Chick as well, however she had the hashbrowns and country ham.  The ham was good, but salty like good ham should be.  The hashbrowns were REALLY soaked in oil/butter.  They were crispy on both sides, but whoa ... really soaked.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nWe got REALLY lucky in that we got there and were able to get seated within about 5 minutes.  This was around 8:30am on a Thursday, as soon as we were seated, the crowd showed up and there were at least 20 people milling around outside waiting to eat.  The parking stinks, micro lot behind the restaurant, and other than that it's metered parking.  $.60/hour is still cheap though.\n\nI enjoyed the food and the experience was a little to crazy for my family of four with two squirmy kids.  I'm not a hater, but I'm not going to tell you it's the best breakfast I've ever had either.  The prices were fair, but again with a family of four with two small kids we tend to appreciate a place with a kid menu.\n\nIf it was only adults and we weren't so wiggly it might have been a different story.  I'm not sure I'm headed back there any time soon with my little wiggle worms.  That being said, you should try it and see what you think.\n\n(big plus is that they took AMEX - one of the few small shops that do)\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd been waiting for the perfect time to experience Matt's.  This Wednesday morning I felt like that time had come.  I figured Wednesday at 11am shouldn't have much of a wait.  It didn't, and we were seated within 10-15 minutes.  The place is cute and the service is really great once you get seated (until then everyone looks kinda rushed and annoyed by you).  \n\nOur experience had it's high points:\n*Our extremely sweet server (love those glasses)\n*The ridiculously good coffee\n*and the novelty of eating in a shoe box.\n\nI got the Hog and Chick with Bacon.  It was yummy, but...gasp....nothing to wait an hour and a half for like most people do on the weekends.  Yes the bacon was thick cut, and the preserves for the toast were lovely, but still, I actually had a hard time picking something off of the menu because nothing seemed to jump out at me as unique or unmissable.  \nOne thing's for sure though, they do the classics well.\nFor me, the above high points are enough to bring me back again, and hopefully next time the special will rock my socks off.  \n\nMatt and Ernie have a great group of concepts, thanks for bringing downtown up a notch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMBB is one of those places that I really like, but can't really explain why. Maybe it's the fresh jam, the perfectly cooked bacon, the cute old fashioned style of the place or  the fact that you tell yourself it just has to be great if everyone else is willing to wait in the desert for up to an hour-ish to have their hand at some..I dunno. \n\nIt is indeed tasty, and I've yet to try anything that disappoints, but the menu (in my humble o-pinion) doesn't really offer anything extraordinarily fantastic enough to warrant the wait. That said, if ever I drive by the place in the a.m. hours and happen to see that there's no line, I will consider it my lucky day and likely mosey on in.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is another place I've seen on Triple D on FoodTV.  The breakfast definitely lives up to it's name - Big Breakfast.  The portions are pretty hearty.  The only downside to this place is it's really, really small and the wait can be very, very long.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's there to say that hasn't already been said? Great, hearty food that sticks to the basics and very good service. \n\nIf there is a special of the day - get it. You wont regret it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall cute place. Get there early or ull be waiting a long time\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple, wholesome ingredients, unpretentious food = home run breakfast.  Coffee was the only let down, it was decidedly watered-out, the classic dinner coffee.  \n\nSign up for a spot on the waiting list and check out the farmer's market that's kitty-corner on Saturdays.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill good as ever.  They have Moved one block up so there isn't a ridiculous waiting time anymore.  I usually go by myself so always sit at the bar/counter area.  Staff is super friendly and my usual:  Waffles with bacon, OJ, and black coffee.\n\nI always end up going there after I land at the airport.  Love this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the type of restaurant you only go to once.\nI have now been there twice - once at the old location, once at the new one.\nThe reason you only go there once?\n\nHOLY WAIT TIME, batman.\n\nI'm sorry, but there has to be a way to make the seating more efficient.  When you're hungry, there's nothing worse than 30-60 minute wait times, or a giant party of 15 people who arrive later than you do and they get to \"squeeze in\". Although Matt's has just upgraded to a new, bigger space, this still isn't the type of restaurant that should be accommodating 15-person groups (AKA almost the entire dining area).\n\nWe went here for my husband's birthday on a Friday morning. After waiting about 45 minutes, we were next on the list but got bumped to the uncomfortable street-facing counter seats, when at that very moment there were three empty two-top tables, completely set with silverware and everything. We asked if we could be seated there instead, but were turned down by the host, because they were being reserved for the aforementioned party. My husband was having trouble with knee pain that morning and the counter seats did not physically accommodate his needs, so we asked our waitress if there was anywhere else we could sit. Again, we were turned down. I was getting a little flustered, not the way you want to feel on your loved one's birthday. We considered leaving, even after we ordered our food. Eventually, they did allow us to sit at a two-top, which I appreciated.\n\nThe food was the only redeeming quality, but again I was too flustered to truly enjoy it. I got the cheese omelette with hash browns. Very good, although hash browns were a greasy, mushy mess. My husband got a ham scramble of some kind. We had a side of rye toast, which was tasty. Beverages were served in cute little jam jars.\n\nPROS:\nFood, Decor, Charm, Ambience, Supporting a local endeavor\n\nCONS:\nThe most hyper-inflated wait time and some of the worst seating options of any restaurant I've ever known.\n\nThe take-out option sounds nice, and would eliminate a lot of my frustrations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest...hashed...browns...ever.  (and yes, it's hashED browns, folks.)  I have tried a new brunch place almost on a weekly basis since I moved here in August, and MBB wins the hashed browns contest hands down.  They're so perfectly and proportionately crispy and soft.  DELISH!  Do try!  \n\nI ordered the hog and chick kind of out of necessity since there wasn't a great variety of choices on the menu, but in the end, it didn't matter cuz it was delicious.  I think the thing about MBB is that everything on the small menu is probably awesome, which is why they can afford to keep the menu small.  A nice touch was that they carried the Sunday newspaper, which was perfect since we forgot ours that particular weekend, and that helped to pass the waiting time for our food (which was not bad at all.  maybe 15 minutes.).  \n\nFor all you coffee lovers, the java here is pretty good as well.  In fact, the waitress told us that the owners of MBB just recently opened up a coffee shop somewhere locally, so I'll have to find out where and go.  I just hope I don't have to wait as long as I did to get into MBB to get some coffee.  Truthfully, it wasn't so bad waiting.  I think we only waited about a half hour.  The only downside to MBB is the small space!  You'd think they would want to expand a little, but mayhaps this is part of the allure for us MBB fans.  No pain, no gain. \n\nSidenote: Parking is not the BEST, but if you go early, you should be able to find a spot just fine.  ALSO, note that they do NOT split checks.  Good to know beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike most great places, a review isn't necessary, so I haven't done so.  My latest visit gave me the need to do so, though.  I needn't say what's already been said, as most of the reviews are the same.\n\n1) You will wait, no matter what time of day or time of year.  Hot summer mornings, early, will have the shortest wait.  If you've never been here, what you do is show up, write down your name and the number of people in your party, snag some water and find some shade.  It's suggested you have good company or a book - you can get bored waiting!\n\n2) All the food is good.  All the food is fresh.  If there is a daily special, get it.\n\n3) Everyone rants and raves about the potatoes.  I could remove one star just to prove a point, but this is a five star place.  The hashbrowns are good because of the potatoes.  They are extremely fresh and full-flavored, unlike anything you get at most restaurants.  That said, they're not the *WORLDS GREATEST HASHBROWNS EVERRRRRRRRRRRR*.  They're fantastic, but they are a bit mushy on the inside.  They are possibly the very best potatoes in town, all said and done.\n\n4) Four Barrel coffee is served here now, instead of Cave Creek.  I'm all for this.  Despite it not being local, it is better than a lot of local roasts.\n\n5) Go here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is the real deal. Awesome portions and variety. I literally spent over an hour eating here because I had to savor each and every bite of the deliciousness\n\n\n\n\n\nI am honestly shocked to see all the less then 5 star reviews on here. \n\nMatt's Big Breakfast serves up an amazing breakfast Every. Single. Time! They are consistent and generally always fast (once you do get seated) \n\nThe lack of seating does suck, but the wait is always always ALWAYS worth it! \n\nThis small family run business holds a special spot in my heart! The hubs and I used to go here every Saturday when we first started dating. They all know us in there and are always so excited to see us when we do make it back there from time to time. You don't get that at other breakfast/lunch joints around here (family run or not)! \n\nMatts breakfast is so amazing and their lunch menu, Oh. My. YUMMY!! \n\nThe egg salad is probably my favorite lunch choice there, the husband swear by the big butter burger! \n\nAnd breakfast is always a tough choice. They always have a tempting special of the day...If I don't go with the special, then sometimes I do a custom omelet, or the waffle...I HAVE to have bacon and the rosemary potato's whenever I go regardless of what I order. They are a must! \n\nWe love Matt's and the whole Matt's family!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a sucker for hash browns. And boy does this place do them right.  They are almost like a potato pancake, but even better.  Perfectly crispy, salty, greasy, but not overly greasy.  Everything else was just the cherry on top of the sundae.  Came here on Friday afternoon (around 1ish) and it was still packed.  We still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad.  The place definitely needs to bogart a few more buildings and expand.  But we sat at the counter and bar stools which made me love my hashbrowns even more.\n\nThe griddlecakes were alright.  Nothing to rave about.  The rueben was good, a little too much sauerkraut for my taste, but others loved it.  The three egg scramble looked fantastic, and by the evidence of the licked-clean plates of my friends, it was a winner.\n\nDefinitely worth a 30 minute wait in my book.  A 2 hour wait?  Eh, probably not.  Even if those hash browns are calling my name right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG, you must be kidding and this place is in business?? so i have heard of Big Matts and wanted to try it. This afternoon i went their for the first time and what a JOKE. first of all i arrived at 12:15 PM and the front door was locked. I asked couple of men that were standing outside how to you get in this place and they told me from the front door, which i was standing in front of. So i knocked on the door and the server opened the door. My first thought is to the owner, dont be cheap and just go ahead and get a real lock for the front door. Then I asked servers where the bathroom was? she told me they dont have one, however they share one with the hotel next door. (this is not a Hilton by the way). I asked i just want to wash my hands. She told me they had hand sanitizer up front. so i used it . I understand the place is small, however, there is health requirement and I am not sure how they pass this. I believe the employees would wash their hands more then once a day. CAUTION!!!! HEALTH. \n\nFood. the server was nice and took my order. I asked for their best item on the menu and she highly recommended the daily special. Okay that is what i will get. I got two scrambled eggs, fresh motezzerla, sausage (disgusting) and sweet peppers, this was served with home potato's and toast. how bad can the eggs be, the sausage was uneatable, the potato's were full of Rosemary, and ONE slice of toast for $ 8.95. I have been to numerous breakfast restaurant  and never remember being served ONE slice of toast. Please dont be cheap for $ 8.95 you can serve two slice of toast. \nI am not sure what the hype is about this place, i will never go there. if you want breakfast go somewhere else like \"the breakfast club\".\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to love a place that still cares enough to use half a stick of butter when they cook your meal.  Throw in some Bourbon candied sausage and you have a real old fashioned breakfast cafe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a place for the calorie conscious, so dieters need to swear off this place like the plague. Even the salads here are smothered in bacon, eggs, cheese and dressing. But if you feel like punishing your arteries in the most delicious fashion, I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. I've heard from just about everyone I know that this place is the bee's knees, the elephant's eyebrows, the eel's hips...and the buzz wasn't wrong. \n\nThis place has some amazing hangover food, so after a night of indulging we arrived at this little diner around noon thirty and had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated. The temperature was well over 100 degrees by that point, which is not good on the dehydrated and hung over, but they were kind enough to provide a giant tub of ice water so that waiting diners didn't drop like flies before they could be served. Two stacks of complimentary foodie magazines were also present for perusal, but my brain didn't feel like thinking yet. However, by the time we were done with our dining experience at one twenty, there were empty booths all over the place, so if you're impatient, go during the last hour they're open.\n\nOnce inside, we sat at the bar, right in the path of the air conditioning vent, with a clear view of the kitchen going ons. Seeing how I drank my share of water outside I ordered an RC Cola (I didn't even know that brand still existed!) that came in a can. While waiting to order, I did some pretty extreme rubbernecking, judging the deliciousness of every dish that came out of the kitchen or was being munched on by others. The menu was modest in size but boasted that they used the freshest organic ingredients whenever possible, and after watching everyone else I was pretty excited when the time came to order. \n\nI decided to go with my traditional breakfast fare, so I could accurately compare it to other brunch joints: eggs over medium, bacon, hashbrowns and sour dough toast. The Hog and Chick!\n\nAnd. It. Was. Heaven.\n\nIt's clear that everything they offered was as fresh as it could possibly be. The toast tasted freshly baked, doughy yet crisp, and was delicious dipped in my eggs. Thick cut peppered bacon melted in my mouth. The hashbrowns had to have been made on the premises, because they looked exactly like the ones I make in my own home, greyer than the freezer variety and a bit gelatinous. There was even a tiny tub of fresh apricot puree that tasted like there wasn't a lick of processed sugar added. \n\nAnd everything was drowned to a lovely crisp in butter.\n\nI only wish it were in Tempe instead of Phoenix, because I'd love to try the other menu offerings. It's cheap, delicious, friendly, and some of the best damn hang over food I have ever had.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first breakfast place I tried when I moved from Indiana to Arizona in May 2010. It is fantastic! \n\nOK, let me get the \"negatives\" out of the way: \n\n1. Small Place, (possible) Long Waits \n- Most people are impatient, no matter how good the food. If you are one of those people and want to eat here; get here BEFORE the doors open. \n\n2. OK, can't think of any more. \n\nAll the Positives: \n\n1. Yes it is small, but it has a wonderful old-school diner feel. \n2. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. \n3. The food is worth the wait! \n\nOn my trip to Matt's I had: \n\n1. Honey Lemonade (not as sweet as you might fear - very tasty) \n2. The Hog and Chick \n(Two eggs and choice of off-the-bone ham, thick-cut bacon, or country sausage - I went with the bacon) \n\nThe eggs were perfect; I always ask for over medium and rarely does a place get the consistency right (Matt's did). \n\nThe thick-cut bacon was always cooked to my specification - not too crispy; I still like a little chew to it. \n\nSince I got there at/before they opened, I was in right away, got my food, enjoyed it, and was out in about 30 mins. \n\nA small place, with great service, great food, and a loyal following. I can see why!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the raving I have heard about Matt's Big Breakfast and the long wait I was so excited to enjoy my food. The quality of the ingredients were high; however, the service was not so great. I felt that the waitresses were attempting to rush us out of the restaurant. I realize that it is a busy place, but their overt pushiness was not warranted. \n\nOverall I would not go back again. The food was made with great ingrediants, but it just didn't \"do it \" for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are times when Phoenix tries my patience, event though I am here only a year.  Why, as someone else more accurately put it, are there only  two decent breakfast places?  Please, if someone knows of another, I'll be grateful for the kind referral!\n\nThe pluses:  the best home fries, real sour dough toast, very excellent marmalade\n\nThe average: decent, above average omelets and waffles, fresh butter\n\nThe minuses: the usual 30-45min wait, cramped, stuffy setting, waitresses are so busy, they bring the check right after the meal, no bathroom\n\nAll I can say is I miss real, well done home fries and crepes!  Where are you Chez Vachon?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went around 8 am on a Thursday, and we had immediate seating. The coffee was amazing. We had the eggs benedict, which were quite good and the hashbrowns were extremely crisp. I had the waffles which melted in my mouth. The batter was not salty but sweet. We were really impressed. Matt's has a tiny parking lot next to the building but parking can be a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuy Fieri's recommendations never disappoint. \n\nCame in with the expectation that this place would be good considering it was on the Food Network but my expectations were exceeded! Had the Salami Scramble which was DELICIOUS! The side of hashbrowns were AMAZING (maybe the best part of the meal) and I was pleasantly surprised the side of toast was a legit piece of bread, like something you would find at a bakery, and not just a slice of bread you could buy at the market. Eggs were fresh and light and the salami was perfection. \n\nOnly downside was that they made us wait outside for our table which was a little ridiculous considering it was 115 degrees outside. But I got nothing bad to say about their food.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways good, Always a smile! \n\nA\" must-go\" if you are anywhere in AZ ...! \n... get to Matt's and you can thank me later! ;) \n\nA HINT: get there a little before 6am or bring an umbrella for the sun in case you have a wait. \n\nRegardless ... wake early, travel with an umbrella or sunscreen OR sit for a bit ... you will be glad you \"close this deal!\" \n\nBfast or Lunch ... the answer is YES!\n\nBon Appetit!\n\n- Britten\n\n\n\n\n\nHi all! Went to Matt's last night for the PJ's and Eggs! Matt was great a bunch of the guys from Hickman farms were there having breakfast too! The special was steak and eggs, while I originally had my little heart set on a butter burger I had to try the Steak and eggs. I was not disappointed it was fantastic! Just as I suspected. I think I am becoming a Matt's groupie! lol. I can't help it between the cozy atmosphere, the friendly staff, fresh delicious menu choices and given that I am supporting a family business I am hooked! Now I will say last night we waited about an hour and there were 5 of us but all agreed it was so worth the wait. PS I had to get a butter burger to go I had it for lunch today YUM! Thanks Erenia and Matt!\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore flying out of Phoenix, we decided to fuel up by having breakfast here.  We were drawn to the location based on the number of reviews.   So, we decided to give it a try.  \n\nWe ate in their new location, apparently, the restaurant was down the block and about 1/2 the size it is now. \n\nThe staff/workers all welcomed us with friendly chat.  They all sported vans, skinny jeans, t-shirts and a zip up sweat shirts.  The industrial like environment made conversations bounce off walls which caused it to be loud and sometimes difficult to hear.  But, it was clean and service was FAST!\n\nI ordered the breakfast special.  Our waiter praised the deliciousness of their french toast and apple smoked sausage.  Wow, was he correct.  The french toast was incredible.  The sausage was good.  I normally do not eat pork products anymore, so my rating of \"good\"; I am sure does not do it justice.\n\nMy husband does not eat pork products, so when we asked about alternatives like chicken sausage, turkey bacon or Soy; they did not have any.  So, his breakfast choice immediately became limited.  He ordered the cheese omelet.  It was filled with mushrooms, and red peppers.  Potatoes and a side of bread accompanied his dish.\n\nThe coffee was not bad; but at the same time left us not thrilled about it either.  So, we strolled a few blocks down to buy some strong brewed Starbucks coffee.\n\nWe enjoyed our experience.  If we lived in Phoenix, I am sure we'd eat there again.  However, on our next visit; we'll probably choose another place with meat alternatives and more green chile.\n\n\n\n\n\nI arrived in Phoenix from San Francisco and was starving so I Yelp'ed breakfast joints in the area and Matt's Big Breakfast was one of the places with the most quality reviews so I said why not?\n\nUpon arriving there were a number of small parties waiting outside so I knew it was going to be a long wait. Me and my sister ended up waiting an hour as the morning Phoenix sun started creeping up on us. We were able to sit at the counter which was awesome because I was able to see Matt cook in the kitchen. I ordered the hog and chick which consisted of scrambled eggs, fat slices of bacon, hash brown and wheat toast. In addition I ordered the orange juice which was freshly squeezed. The toast is freaking amazing! Best toast I've ever had! The homemade jam was tasteful because it didn't taste like the nasty jam you would get at normal diners. The hash brown was perfect! Crispy brown on the top and bottom and juicy in the inside. The hash brown was the best I've had because it wasn't dry which makes eating that much more enjoyable. The bacon... It was freaking delicious! 4 fat slices of bacon. Yum! I rarely finish my breakfast but I surprisingly finished the hog and chick plate at Matt's.\n\nI will most definitely be back if I'm ever in then phoenix area. This is the best breakfast joint in Arizona and maybe the west coast. Try it out but beware of the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing from busy Los Angeles, California, this place is stellar in the mellow neighborhood of Arizona. A little mom n pop breakfast house. Little in size but big in name where I had to wait for 45 minutes. Yes!! just for a plate of breakfast. \n\nFriend and I got the pesto pork chop and the hash brown ham combination. Hands down best hash brown ever! Crispy on the outside but savory sweet potatoes on the inside. Eggs were huge and had a very sweet yolk...organic maybe. \n\nOverall was just very satisfying for a simple American breakfast. Nothing fancy but premium ingredients for solid goodness. Honestly best hash brown  and home fried potatoes I've had thus far. Caramelized and seasoned to perfection. I can really eat potatoes every day if this place was around town.\n\nStreet parking but it's not bad at all on a weekend. I'm glad I was able to swing by on my visit here. Definitely must try if you're close in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here this morning. As usual, the wait was crowded out to the corner of 1st Street. People are willing to wait for good food, I suppose. \n\nOnce you get inside Matt's Big Breakfast (it was about an hour wait for us on a Saturday morning), you see why it took so long. There's about 15 seats in the whole place and it's tiny...like a Manhattan hotel room. People are bumping into each other, sliding around and the commotion is high. It's loud, it's gritty and it's the perfect diner setting.\n\nFor all the press it's gotten, the food better be damn good. And it is. The eggs are cage raised and organic, the pork is from high-quality Iowa farms and most of the produce is local. The fresh-squeezed OJ is legit. And the coffee is from a premium roaster in Cave Creek, AZ. The hash browns are very much like you would find at a joint in the Midwest: buttery on the inside and crispy brown on the outside. \n\nDo yourself a favor and brave the wait and the commotion... it's worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first time I had gone to Matt's Big Breakfast. I had heard some amazing things about it, outside of the fact that the wait times were horrendous, due to the fact that their original location was SO small. Low and behold, they opened up a second location, more than twice the size of their original one (still pretty small to be honest), so we HAD to try it. \n\nWe arrived at 7am on a Saturday morning, thinking we'd have NO issues getting in THAT early. We were wrong. We waited an hour or so... it could have been a longer wait though since our whole party didn't show up til 7:15ish. After the long anticipated wait, we finally ordered! Let me just mention, you really can't substitute or make many changes, if any, to your order. I ordered pancakes and wanted some blueberries, but was told no, lol. Regardless, the pancakes were super delicious! And they came with real maple syrup. Side note... use the syrup sparingly, asking for any extra will cost you an additional $1.50 :P\n\nOn another note, I heard their eggs benedict was AMAZING! Sadly, it's only a special and it wasn't on the day I went. I may just have to go again to try it!\n\n\n\n\n\nate there this am. Waited 45 min. This is part of the culture of this place so be prepared to wait. The food was great. We had the special, extra bacon and lemonaide. this bill was 30 bucks including tip. I am a fan. If you are not a fan of the AZ heat, you may want to wait until fall to chow down. It's hot outside and hot inside. It's a tiny place with great food! The bacon is yummy and the toast is THICK sliced with homemade jam.( Didn't have coffee cuz we got it across the way while we waited for our time to eat.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place came highly recommended.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.\n\nThey have a boring, uninspired menu. Nothing special. The food itself was fine.  It was fresh, and they apparently use all-natural organics.  We had the special Denver scramble. The home fries are chunks of pan-fried potato. Lots of rosemary.  But the flavors just weren't very exciting or bold.\n\nThe strawberry preserves were very good, as was thick cut toast.  Yes, the toast is worth mentioning.  Cut thick, toasted to perfection.  And the bread itself is a really good bread.\n\nI doubt I will return.  If I'm going to go out for breakfast I would choose someplace that features bolder flavors, like The Farmhouse in Gilbert.\n\nMy wife liked it better than I did.  It's really not bad, but if I'm going to go out and pay for a meal I prefer something less pedestrian.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time I came here (their old location) I sat outside and waited for an hour and a half in the pouring rain. I had biked over, so I literally had nowhere indoors to sit and wait.\n\nAlthough I was hangry (adjective: angry from hunger), soaking wet and slightly impatient (this was back before they offered wait times), it was worth it.\n\nMatt's hash browns are perfectly crisp and golden. The eggs are rich and delicious, unlike the ones you find in chain grocery stores. The coffee (from a local roaster) is clean, fresh and bright. Their 5 Spot sandwich is a perfect sampling of all their delicious breakfast offerings, and the simple Hog n Chick is a fresh, local take on a classic egg and ham breakfast.\n\nI would recommend Matt's Big Breakfast to absolutely everyone.\n\nTip: If you don't want to wait for half an hour to 45 minutes, come between 7:45 and 8:15 nearly any morning of the week. The wait will be ~5 minutes, and you'll be leaving just as people begin to pile up!\n\n\n\n\n\nChecked-in and asked for a cup of coffee. Woman at register was a complete bi!$& and was completely disgruntled and on a huge power trip.  I had to purchase a coffee to go and she threw my card onto the counter.\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah...........What everyone else said.........Food is great.  Restaurant is small.  Line is long.  Service is great.  \n\nIf they delivered this would be the world's best breakfast place.  Even if they had take out.  But delivery?  That would be fantastic.  I could totally picture myself hung over eating a hog and chick in bed.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have wanted to visit Matt's for quite some time now. My attempts have always been thwarted due to the extraordinary lines, the lack of time, and a growling stomach. Today, finally, I remedied that situation and finally ate at Matt's.\n\nIs Matt's overhyped? Perhaps. The small venue nearly guarantees a long wait. Is the food worth it? That is always a matter of opinion, but in mine, I think it was. I ordered the pancakes, pancakes that happened to be lightest and fluffiest I have probably ever eaten. For a side, I chose the cranberry walnut toast. It was good, as expected. Toast is hard to mess up unless obviously burnt. The friend who ate with me ordered the special that day, an egg scramble with sausage, havarti, and sweet peppers and rosemary. After sampling a bite, I wish I had ordered the special instead. The pancakes were good, but the special was great.\n\nWill I go back to Matt's? The answer is yes, though realistically it may not happen for a while due to the typical long wait times. Given the fact a wait is common, it might be a nice add to offer free WiFi or free coffee service outside for those waiting.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning, we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small, and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork. That narrowed our choice to pretty much pancakes (just say \"killing me softly with your buttah..\"), so we bolted -- to Palatte. \n\nI'm sure it's great if you like good ol' home cookin' diner food, but for this New York food snob, the choices are too few to wield my wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is awesome!!!  I am a die-hard fan of Robert's in Tucson but this is the first place that gives them a run for their money.  Homemade thick slabs of bread served with fresh strawberry jam and an egg scramble with spinach and havarti = breakfast heaven.  This place is tiny and I'm sure gets packed as we went on a Tuesday morning and there was a small wait but it's so worth it!\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Awesome location.\n2. Fantastic Food.\n3. Great environment.\n\nOnly reason to not give it 5 stars is because the wait time is so long but this place is a must go.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen here after seeing it on food network.  The country potatoes and steak omelet with a side of bacon is what I had along with their honey lemonade.  Food was great and service was pretty good.  Everyone was super friendly, it just gets so busy that the work crew can't attend to everyone all the time.  I would definitely go here again.  Probably one of the best breakfasts I've had!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a small place with a big name. Luckly we went after the lunch rush about 1:15 and had to wait only 15 min. This is a small place and we had 4 people, so they had to put two tables together for us. We ordered the griddle cakes, the hog and chick, salami scramble and the chop and chick. The wait time on the food was average and it came out hot and straight from the kitchen (which was not far away). The griddle cakes were very good, light and fluffy. The warm maple syrup and real butter were good touches. The salami scramble and the hog and chick were good , but nothing special. The chop and chick was highly recommended to me so I was excited to try it. The flavor was good , but they over cooked it a bit. It was on the dry side and did not wow me. I did like the hash browns. As a rule I have not found any place that does good hash browns.This place does. Crunchy on the outside without being dry on the inside. The service was good and the overall experience fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn my recent vacation I learned that Guy Fieri can be trusted with any food decision. \n\nWe waited 1.5 hours on a Saturday morning to get in to Matt's, and I would wait longer next time if I had to. \n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and the food was beyond description. \n\nI ordered the Five Spot, a side of Home fries, and a Honey Lemonade. \n\nThe Five Spot was a breakfast sandwich featuring a fried egg, thick cut bacon, cheese, and grilled onions. Its possible that there was another element on the sandwich, but I was in taste heaven and didn't stop to consider what the sandwich was made of.... My home fries were thick cut potatoes with lots of grilled onions and large pieces of rosemary. The large pieces allowed for the flavor to permeate, and I was able to pick around them so that it didn't feel that I was chewing on little sticks. \n\nThe honey lemonade was so great that I ordered a second glass to-go! \n\nMatt's is small and seats only 25 diners at a time, but it is definitely a flavor powerhouse! \n\nFrom now on, I will encourage anyone I know traveling to Phoenix to stop by Matt's. It was fantastic.\n\n\n\n\n\nI CANNOT believe that I have not rated this place yet... what the?!?!? I LOVE it here. Every time I have tried something different and every time I  am glad I did. This place is not only great but everyone is nice.  Ive even waited outside in the summer...that alone should say something!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friend recommended this place when she was visiting me in Phoenix because she heard about this place on food channel. It was on triple D's (Diners, Drive-in, Dives). We came here on a Sunday morning for a late brunch (around 1pm).\n\nWhen we arrived there, it was street parking. We were able to find a place on the street. The place is very small, it reminds me of a very casual, good home-cooking restaurant - not fancy but just good food.\n\nWe put our name on the list outside. For a party of two, our wait was about 30-45 minutes. It was long but it didn't feel too long. It was a hot day so we waited in the shade. The hostess that sat us was very nice. We sat at the bar. My friend ordered the scramble special and I decided to order the Chop and Chick with wheat toast, hashbrowns and over easy eggs.\n\nThey served water in a little jars which I love. It's so cute and it reminds me of a simple, home-cooked. I looked around to see what everyone else was eating, it seems like couples like to split the food because the portions are big. Hence, the name \"Matt's Big Breakfast.\"\n\nService is quick. The waitress and waiters are attentive and they are constantly moving. The food came out in a decent time, it wasn't too long but not too quick. \n\nWhen our food arrived, I almost thought they forgot my toast with my order. I asked them about it but they assured they did not forget me. My pork chop tasted like a pork chop I can make at home. I was a pan-fried pork chop that was oily and greasy. It wasn't seasoned too heavily, it wasn't too salty or peppery. The hashbrowns were very oily as well. I would like the hasbrown to be more crispy than oily. It was softer than I like. The wheat toast came with homemade strawberry jam. The strawberry jam was very sweet and had a strong strawberry aroma, I like the jam. \n\nMy breakfast was decent, it wasn't spectacular or horrible. It was a little more oily than I expected. It is your typical homecooked breakfast, they didn't mess up my order or anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you like some food with your butter?\r\n------------------------------\r\nFinally made my way down to Matt's Big Breakfast with some friends. We got there at about 10:30 and waited about 10 minutes for a table for 3, so that was pretty good, considering how small the place is.\r\n\r\nThe cute and feisty waitress got us all coffee, plus I got the OJ (Sarah K's review was spot on - it really is a tiny glass with half of it pulp). I ordered the cheese omelette with mushrooms & sauteed onions, sided with home fries and wheat toast. My friends got the hog & chick and a cheese omelette, both with well-done hash browns. We then ordered a plate of griddle cakes to split three ways. \r\n\r\nThe food soon was laid in front of us. All I can say is, I hope you like butter. Because butter was everywhere. I came prepared though, armed with my quiver of Lactaid pills. So bring it on, Matthew. I'm ready.\r\n\r\nThe food was great. Omelette was perfect and the home fries, seasoned with rosemary, were excellent. The griddle cakes were perfect for me, since I'm a big fan of the real maple syrup and light, fluffy flapjacks. My friends were fans of their hash browns, completely crisp and crunchy on the outside, and runny with butter on the inside. I'd never seen hash browns like this before, but I took a biteful to see for myself and the verdict? Really, really good. My friends enjoyed their meals, and our coffees and water were always being refilled, which was a great plus, along with our ongoing bantering with the waitress. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a great place to start off your Saturday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in Saturday morning, early enough to beat the crowds. (After 7.30ish, fuggetabouit....). Ordered Hog (sausage patties) and Chick, but really didn't want hashbrowns. No subs tough, so got a single pancake side. Sadly, I must say it was only an average breakfast. Eggs OM as requested, and sausage good, but almost too spicy, overpowering the pork. The hashbrowns are a waste though, like an afterthought to fill the plate. Almost burned, raw in the middle. Easy enough issue to fix though. Matt should bump up the quality control to keep the place hoppin'. No big worries though, I'll be comin' back!\n\n\n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, I finally had my first Matt's experience this morning... I'd been hearing about Matt's Big Breakfast for ages, but never really wanted to make the drive to wait forever just for a greasy breakfast!\n\nHowever, we were talked into Matt's by some friends of ours that were also Matt's virgins... we met there around 10am, only to find that there were about 2 full pages worth of names ahead of us, and that they would not quote a wait... Matt's was smaller than I imagined, so I knew it would take awhile.  We debated going elsewhere and even went over to The Turf for coffee.  (If the service there were better there, we probably would've just stayed there, but we figured if we were going to wait, we'd just wait for Matt's).  My pregnant friend went into Matt's at one point to use the bathroom and they told her she had to go to the hotel nextdoor and 'ask for Mike.'  That was a bit shady...\n\nAbout an hour and a half later, our party of four was seated... and needless to say, we were all starving by then!  We started with some fresh squeezed OJ and coffee.  (The OJ glasses were tiny, but each sip tasted like heaven... and I was pleased to see that they use coffee fresh from Cave Creek Coffee Co.)\n\nWhen it was time to order, I was extremely disappointed that after that long wait, they were out of whole wheat toast.  I ended up getting an egg white omelette (yes, they do egg whites), hashbrowns, sour dough toast + preserves.  I could eat only about half of it... but what I did eat was good, greasy, and filled me up for most of the day.\n\nI don't really see myself rushing back to Matt's again anytime soon - unless it's on a weekday when the wait isn't so bad.  But I will say I'm happy that I finally made it to Matt's - and oh, what an experience it was!\n\n\n\n\n\nI wouldn't wait an hour in the heat, but the food is amazing, the pancakes and bacon especially, and who can fault hand-squeezed orange juice?  Come early, or in the middle of the week to avoid the crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverpriced is my first thought. Overall our food was good and service was friendly and all but I wasn't going \"wow\" because of the price. I don't mind paying for large portions or something super good but $7.50 for a couple pancakes is too much for my retired wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nGriddlecakes and bacon were fabulous.  As others have said expect a wait.  The place is TINY.  Servers were really nice.  I had griddlecakes, bacon and a diet RC and with tip it was $16.  Portions were generous and I was only able to eat one pancake.  Another side note is it's so tiny your wait is outside... Consider the weather.  There is no shade.  I thought it was worth it but I am not sure I'd wait again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best breakfast place in Phoenix. Everytime I go i get the special.. which changes every time.. can't go wrong.... it's a long wait and small place but it's worth the wait\n\n\n\n\n\nTotally worth the wait, for all the people complaining about the wait... If you dont have the patience to wait for quality food, call ahead or go to Denny's. Their portions are very large, and honestly I don't get why that is a complaint, get a togo box and enjoy the rest of your lunch or breakfast later.\n Everyone is always friendly who works there and you have to respect the fact that almost all of there food is locally sourced.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the 5 stars show \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" Ok, it is only breakfast but  great, consistent fair. Tiny little place so you will have to wait but they keep the folks rolling in and out. Been there twice and have sat at the counter both times. The Hog & Chick with bacon, thick bacon...awesome!  Eggs the way you want. Get the hash browns as they are better than you can make at home, but if you like your potatoes chunky then get the home fries but a warning for people who aren't into rosemary, home fries have rosemary on them. Fresh sliced toast and homemade jam, I think it was plum. My wife had the omelet and loved it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverhyped?\nWhat am I missing here?\nI was very excited about checking out Matt's. We went on a Sunday morning, so I expected a long wait (I even brought a book).\nThere was about an hour wait ahead of us, so I was already happy it wasn't longer than that.\nThe exterior is cute. I was already giving the place a point on style alone and because the interior is oh-so tiny! \nThey had some retro looking fans going-we ended up sitting in the rear room.\nI had the eggs and sausage, with wheat toast. Meh. I wasn't crazy about the food. The prices were very reasonable though.\nMy toast was way too thick, and was more a multi-grain than a wheat (hey I know the difference). I like thin, crunchy toast, not giant slabs of semi toasted bread.\nThere is no bathroom-you have to go next door to the creepy motel to use the bathroom which is in a room .Did I mention creepy? it's super creepy.\nBack to the food. I didn't notice any size selections for the juices. I had an orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and very tasty, but oh so tiny. I could have finished it in a gulp.\nNo one read us any specials, though I did hear the people next to us were read the specials (hey maybe I wanted the steak and eggs?! At least gimme the option. hmmph).\nThe service was hurried, but not rude. Our drinks were never refreshed.. so I was licking the pulp out of my cup by my 3rd bite.\nMy husband had the belgian waffle. Again, Meh. Nothing special.\nThere was really nothing special here that would make me come back, the wait alone, though not as long as I expected, will keep me away.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for breakfast on a Friday. Waited a hour and a half to be seated, but it was worth the wait.  Breakfast here isn't fancy, just good.  They specialize in fresh pork products. I had the homemade country sausage and eggs. My son had the pork chop and eggs.  Both were very tasty.  We also split an order of griddle cakes.  They were light and fluffy. Overall, a great breakfast establishment, but plan on waiting. I can only imagine how long the wait is on weekends. Kudos to Elena, she does a great job of making sure things run smoothly and that patrons are taken care of.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for the first time last month. I had read a lot of reviews and was expecting a wait. It was about 15-20 minutes so it was not too bad, and definitely worth it. The place is just so cute inside. The bread was amazing and the preserves were awesome. I love that they only cook with real butter and olive oil. The husband loves green Tabasco on his eggs (any pretty much everything else) and they didn't have any so that was a bummer but the food was very fresh. A very unique place, I would definitely recommend it!\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's new location is bigger, but they have preserved the ambiance that makes Matt's a breakfast destination.  It doesn't matter how big they make the diner; there will always be a line to get in there!  The simple secret is the fresh, real ingredients they use, locally-sourced whenever possible.  When you're a regular, they know your name and your order.  Big plus, in my book, is the new digs have a bike rack.  LOVE Matt's Big Breakfast!  It truly is as good as it gets.\n\n\n\n\n\nWaited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list. She said she wasn't skipping me, that there were places for two people to sit, but not one. The last time I checked, one person is able to sit where two people can sit. I don't give a pretty fuck that you are trying to turn more tables, if I am waiting 30 mins, when it's my turn, ITS MY TURN. If someone that came after me, sits before I do, you are skipping me. There is no arguing with me about it. Won't be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways a wonderful experience here. Fantastic staff, big portions, reasonable prices and delicious food. The new location is great - you still have to wait, but there is a lot more room inside and nice that there are more parking options outside.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk so the look of the portions in the pictures are very deceptive.  The waffle and pancakes arent big as they look, however I am stuffed so I guess the waffle was big enough.  the food was very good, I thought it would be better, but I am not disappointed.  I would come back here :) the waffle was not as good as the farm and the pancakes were not as good as first watch. but thats just my opinion.  Next time I want to try some of their scrambles.\n\n\n\n\n\nScrambled eggs & Salami. Very good, The hash browns & jam were superb\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast was featured on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives. \n\nI've been to some of the top rated breakfast spots in the country, and have to say that Matt's ranks right up there as one of the best.\n\nI ordered the Waffle, which comes with Bacon, and also ordered a side of Hash Browns. The food all tasted very fresh and amazing and you could tell a lot of thought was put into every detail. \n\nThe Waffle- A large Belgium style waffle that was fluffy and cooked to perfection. I love the little metal syrup container that comes on the side and contains the perfect amount of warm syrup.\n\nThe Bacon- The best bacon I've ever had!  Thick, perfectly cooked, and the right amount of pepper coating.\n\nHash Browns- Awesome! I'm a big hash brown fan and these are really good. Perfectly cooked with an amazing fresh taste.\n\nMost of the top rated breakfast places that I've been to are ranked high for their delicious and creative breakfast items. Matt's get's five stars because they take the traditional breakfast staples and serve them to perfection.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn hour and a half wait...I thought after seeing this on DDD (from the Food Network) that it has to be pretty darn good considering how they raved about it. Was wrong to believe them. It was normal breakfast food that just tasted fresher than what you could eat at Denny's. Not sure why people are obsessed with it. I guess for that long of a wait you expect very yummy food and it was a let down.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe heard this was the best breakfast place in the Phoenix area so we had to check it out.\n\nThe long wait wasn't fun, but we figured if that many people were willing to wait almost an hour (10:30am on a Saturday, go figure), then it must be good.\n\nIt did not disappoint. The waffles were great, but my favorite was the homefries!\n\nIt was small and quaint and we had good service with a friendly staff.\n\nOh yeah, and they serve RC Cola, which made it even a better experience for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nI rarely agree with the culinary opinions of Guy Fieri, Human Cheese Fry, but I guess even a stopped clock is right twice a day.  \n\nFor about a year, I was at Matt's once a week when work would take me from North Phoenix to Tempe.  Service was nice, food was good, prices were silly, chairs were cramped, pretty much what you'd expect.  But after a while, I realized I was paying around $8 for eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns.  Sure, it was good, but it was a little much.\n\nStill, I stop by Matt's every once in a while to enjoy the food and atmosphere.  It's a great place to take your vacationing relatives, foodie friends, or other people who you wouldn't mind being crammed into a small space with.\n\nHOWEVER: If you stop by after around 7 AM on most weekdays, or at all on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  The weekend lines are ridiculous; you can hear people proudly proclaim how they woke up at 2:00 AM to drive down from Flagstaff to get the food.  Plan accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, I wait in line for the bacon. \nMatt's bacon is not for everyone, that's for sure. Vegetarians, look away! 'cause this stuff is fatty, medium-rare, meat candy! The pepper sounded off-putting to me until I tasted it, and oh, how I enjoy it.\nBeen there many times and whenever my Foodie brother is in town, he takes me there so he can get 2 or 3 orders of bacon.\nGreat on the side of their Griddlecakes, which taste like a combination of a corn muffin and a pancake. De-lish.\nWorth the wait.\nOh, and remember: this is a Divey Diner in an undesirable section of Downtown Phoenix--so SNOBS BEWARE!\nThe rest of us will continue to enjoy the homemade goodness.\n\n\n\n\n\nmy best friend and I went to Matt's Big Breakfast a few weeks ago after I read the rave reviews here on yelp.\n\npostitives: free parking, HUGE portions, delicious food taste just like your grandmothers big yummy breakfast, really cute and quaint decor, we were seated immediately, great location downtown phoenix. I ordered the cheese omelet, it came quick and it was gigantor and delicious, thick slices of toast came with it and my hashbrows were the best I've ever tasted in life\n\nnegatives: it can not be underemphasized how miniature this place is, very small menu options, cost is a bit inflated\n\nI recommend it for a try.\n\n\n\n\n\nwords can not describe the goodness that is matt's big breakfast. i came out here while on business/vacation and had matt's waffle. i have since been on a tear back here in L.A. looking for a waffle of equal caliber, but to no avail. \n\nlight, fluffy, perfectly sweet. i've even contemplated braving the 120 degree + weather just to savor the waffle that obliterates all other waffles.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't believe it took me so long to try this place! Heard about it from friends and of course saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and I had been wanting to try it forever but just never had the chance. I finally tried it with some friends and WOW was it good! I had the salami scramble which was DELICIOUS! Never though of putting salami in eggs but I knew I had to try it and it was really delicious...the eggs and salami combo was really tasty. Got that with hash browns and sourdough toast...I have to say, the hash browns were the BEST I've ever tasted. I have no idea what they do to them to make them so good but they were amazing! Very crunchy too which I love. The toast and coffee were quite good as well, and I can't wait to try the pancakes next time!! Best breakfast I've had in a long time!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood but not worth the wait, we waited over 2 hours for a party of 3.  Very nice staff and place looks clean.  Nothing really stood out to justify that type of wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese guys have it nailed, the breakfast is \"of Champions\". The fresh blueberry jam that comes with the killer fresh toast is so good I could eat it off the floor. (and possibly did cause I dropped some off my knife :). The only reason that I give them 4 instead of 5 stars is that WE GET IT you are small, you're hipster, you're non commercial...but for the love of Pete make the place a little bigger, so more than 3 people can eat inside at a time and we don't have to go on a wait EVERY time we come. But the quality is awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\ntook car for repairs this early this morning and had time before taking friend to work so he said, \"Where are we going for breakfast?\"  I said, \"I don't know, where are you taking me?\"  Realized we were in area of Matt's Big Breakfast, looked it up on Yelp for address and decided to try it.  Special today was Eggs Benedict with choice of hash browns or home fries.  I normally don't like poached eggs but thought I'd give it a try.  Glad I did.  The hollandaise sauce was delicious, the canadian bacon was very flavorful, nice sized english muffin and I choose hash browns which were soft and moist but a little too dark.  friend got the 3 egg salami sopprosata omelete (sure spelled wrong) with hash browns and oj.  the homemade, organic strawberry preserves they serves with his toast was amazing.  not too tart, not too sweet, just wonderful.  \n\nwill go back again, however, probably not during the snowbird season.  we were able to get right in this morning and we did hear some regulars talk about how it was nice to see so many people in there today, considering it's now off season for visitors.  apparently, as others have indicated, there can be very long waits to get in.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered 2 eggs over medium hashbrowns & the Griddle Cakes. My husband had the Classic Reuben. \n\nSERVICE - 2 stars - Waitresses were rude. And were transparently erked when we asked for Non Dairy Creamer.\nTASTE - 4 stars - Food was really good. But my eggs were over easy not over medium, the way I ordered them. \nVALUE - 1 star - they give you 2oz of syrup for an entire order of Griddle Cakes... then charge you $1.50 for every 2oz of extra syrup you order. My husbands Reuben had hardly any meat on it. \n\nOVERAll - 2.3 ... Taste was excellent but service and bang for my buck did not meet, even my most minimum of stanfards.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nWill I be going back?... probably not. \nWill I recommend to a friend... NO!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure you're asking how good can breakfast be? At Matt's it's the little things that count. Instead of giving you a piece of bread from a bag they give you a huge piece of fresh baked bread with real butter and homemade preserves. The organic eggs they use to make breakfast taste amazing and the syrup here puts Aunt Jemima to shame! Want to avoid the horrible wait everyone talks about? At Matt's the early bird gets the worm. Arrive between 6am-8am and you won't have to wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst come, first serve so put your name down quick on that notepad...\nSuper friendly staff with super friendly comfort food.  \n\nDon't go with a big party! The three of us ordered grass fed steak and eggs, the pork chop and egg, the bacon and home fries... all were delicious!  The wheat bread came with their home made strawberry preserves.  \n\nGreat for an american breakfast spot!\n\n\n\n\n\n12/10/09\nFinally had the chance to take Mom in to enjoy breakfast at MBB!  I tried taking her here once, but the line out the door was ridiculous; Even today there was a bit of a wait, and it wouldn't have been so taxing if it weren't so cold!  (We arrived at 10:15a, sat down at 10:45a, and had our meals delivered at around 11:10a.  Again, the wait times wouldn't have been so bad if my Mom wasn't due to be at the airline gate at 11:40a!)\nMom ordered the 3-egg salami omelette and hash browns w/ cranberry-walnut toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng#-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng, while I had the ham steak, hash browns, eggs (over-medium, please!), and whole-grain toast.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q#OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q  (Let me just say that we both LOVED the cranberry-walnut toast!  Is it MJ bread or from Simply Bread??  I've got to get a hold of some to have at home!)  I enjoyed the ham steak and the hash browns were wonderful, as always.  Eggs are always delicious here- aren't they from local Hickman Farms?  Mom didn't enjoy her omelette so much- too much salami!  I don't like salami, but I tried a bite anyway.  Yep, I STILL don't like salami...  However, she did enjoy the eggs, after picking off most of the meat, and the bread w/ the plum jam.\nI'm always happy when my Mom enjoys herself at a restaurant that I take her to, so thank you MBB for helping her start her vacation right!\n\n\n\n\n\nIT WAS AMAZING. My friends and I were on a road trip to the Grand Canyon and also visiting a friend in the area, so we decided to stop by this place. It was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-In's and Dives and definitely worth every minute of it! \n\nWe got their daily special - spicy chirizo sausages with eggs, jalapeos and with hash browns on the side. The food came out pretty quickly and it was just perfect. The fresh jalapeos added a slight kick but the spiciness did not overwhelm the taste of the sausages. The eggs that were scrambled in with the meat was perfectly light and fluffy. Their hashbrowns were fried with butter, so it tasted a bit different from your typical hashbrowns. I am not a huge fan of butter fried anything, so I didn't really care for it, but my friends all LOVED it.  One of my friends got the waffles with a strip of bacon, and the bacon was thick and crispy, cooked just right. Also, don't forget about the coffee! It's delicious - not too acidic like Starbucks, just the way I like it. \n\nThe decor in the restaurant is also very cute - bright yellow doors, retro looking posters on the walls, a small traditional diner like table sectioning off one of the corners. All of our servers were super friendly and made the entire experience a blast. If you are in the area, it's definitely a place you have to check out!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring one of our Spring Training trips, we stopped by here for breakfast on Guy Fieri's recommendation on Diners, Driveins and Dives. The place gets packed and it's a small little area, so expect to wait at least an hour. We waited for 90 minutes before we got in on a Sat morning...\n\nWell worth the wait! Ben had their omelet scrabble special with spinach, cheese and sausage. I had a simple scrabble eggs with sausage. Obviously, I liked Ben's dish WAY better. We ordered a side of their peppered bacon, they were thick and juicy and DELICIOUS! Ben was in love with their home fries, the hint of rosemary really added to the favor. Their pancakes and french toast looked good too, but we were too stuffed to try it.\n\nWe are going back on our next Spring Training trip! Definitely a must try, but like everyone said, be prepared to wait a LONG time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are craving basic nothing special breakfast food save yourself the hour long wait outside in the 100 degree heat and go eat at Denny's or IHOP.  Trust me you'll pay half as much and leave feeling less icky.\n\nI seriously don't understand the draw of this place.  The whole restaurant seats maybe 20-30 people, so we ended up sitting outside in the heat for over an hour waiting for a table.  Other reviews claim much longer wait times.  When we finally got a table our waitress was friendly enough and got our drink orders pretty promptly.  When they brought us our food  was nothing special just eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns.  The quality was no better than what you might get at any typical breakfast joint.  Seriously Food Network I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  The waitress forgot to bring us our bread.  After two requests and our meal just about finished our bread was finally delivered to the table.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend's bread had a little something extra...a nice long hair.  Disgusting!!  \n\nNever again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have found that during the summer on a Sunday morning before 930 is the best time to go to Matt's....at least that is my favorite time.   Why you may ask? No wait!  I have yet to wait in line at all when I go that early.  But mostly I have been by myself and I find a seat at the counter.  \n\nWhile I scan through the specials, I find myself more often than not, getting the Hog and Chick with Bacon and Hashbrowns.  I have tried the sausage patties and the ham.  I was not impressed by the saugage and while the ham is VERY good, the bacon still wins out.  The hashbrowns alone keep coming back for more and I am not a big potatoe fan.\n\nBut I admit I am spoiled living just a few blocks away....\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, you have to wait a long time to eat here... I came to Matt's on a Saturday with a friend and we waitedddddddd, but boy was it worth it. It could just be that I was just THAT hungry and anything I ate at that point was going to be amazing, but I'd like to think it was because the food wasn't some greasy no flavor mess you get at iHOP or god forbid...Denny's. They use fresh ingredients and they have REAL butter on their pancakes and waffles!!!! btw...the waffles are like....how do I put this?.... Waffle heaven! When they offer you the home fries or the hash browns, say home fries! and I only say that because I have not tasted the hash browns and I think the home fries are amazing! The home fries are potatoes made in buttery goodness, rosemary, and onions (not over-onion-baring at all). The freshly squeezed orange juice is tiny but it is sooo worth the $2.50 for those exquisite 6 sips! Staff was very attentive and friendly, the hostess was apologizing to everyone for the wait... and I think she really meant it :)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's everything and then some.  I only give it four stars because of how packed it is, and it can be kind of claustrophobic at times.  Other than that, I will wait all day in that line outside just to eat here!  So super yummy!  Definately a must try!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service sucks at Matt's. Unfortunately for those of us that like good food AND good service the food is crave worthy- better than any breakfast I have ever had, so simple and so, so, yummy. That being said, I have never been to a restaurant that ran out of cream for coffee. Not only that but they made it seem like no big deal, no apologies. I had one too many bad experiences and have not been back since. I have been tempted many a time to go back and see if they have changed their evil ways, but I just can't bring myself to do it. We'll see- life is too short to hold grudges, especially when good food is involved, right?\n\nUPDATE: Ok, we ventured back to Matt's to celebrate my birthday in April and I have to say that the service wasn't bad at all.... no more snotty waitresses, so I am adding 2 more stars. If they would make the effort to be really friendly they would get my 5th star... but I won't hold my breath, I think it is just not that kind of place. Now if you really are a thrill seeker I have a challenge for you... go to the bathroom at Matt's (go ahead and ask them where the bathroom is and you will see what I mean)... and if you want to have a good laugh imagine a nine months pregnant woman trying to go to the bathroom at Matt's... yeah, that was fun, luckily I escaped with little more than a pinch on the thigh from the toilet seat... but unless you have a death wish you should definitely empty your bladder BEFORE you go to Matt's...fair warning.\n\n\n\n\n\nI consider myself an expert on breakfast. I know this place is all the rave, but I think it stinks. Let me list the reasons. First, the place is tiny. Second, you can never get in. Third, the food is OK, and their soda sucks; they serve RC! Fourth, the place is always hot in the summer. Fifth, when you finally get a seat it is uncomfortable (They serve fat people food, but yet their seating is set up for a 5'1\" 100 pound girl). Sixth, it is a small neighborhood place so you would think people would be nice, but they are pretty stand offish. If you have ever been to nasty truck stop (versus a good one), this is the same type of food and atmosphere. Unless you are a yuppie and looking to slum it and want to say you experienced it, I suggest skipping this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food at Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty great. I defy you to find a better omelette anywhere in town.  However...\n\nI don't know why they had to go ahead and screw up perfectly good food with such terrible service.  Do not go to Matt's if you are thirsty. It takes forever to get your drinks and forget about re-fills. The waiters all act like you are bothering them if you ask for anything. The act like the good food gives them carte blanche to drop the ball on service entirely. Also - STOP using so much OIL. Yucky!\n\n***Edited on 10/07 to add the following: The staff at Matt's must be reading all the Yelp's about their poor service because I went back there today and they were really NICE! It was the first time they have ever been so attentive, quick and nice. And they were not just nice to me. They were nice to everyone. It was awesome! There is one kind of bitchy, slow, mean waitress who was not there today - so maybe everyone is in a better mood on her day off. I hope this trend of excellent service at Matt's continues. It it does I will re-Yelp with only positive things to say. Except...still...chill out with the oil!\n\n\n\n\n\nWant a simple breakfast without doodads and sprinkles? Hate when people come clapping by your table to sing Happy Birthday to little Timmy in the booth behind you when all you want is some f-ing breakfast and coffee? Matt's is the place for you. \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Amy D for lunch here a while back. I must say I was seriously surprised how simple everything was. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is a pretty straightforward breakfast joint. For my breakfast, I had bacon, eggs, hash browns and 1 pancake that was large enough for two. I washed it all down with their honey sweetened lemonade, which I thoroughly enjoyed! \n\nSo why three stars? First of all, a three star rating is NOT a bad rating. Second, it's breakfast. There really is no way to mess up a simple breakfast. I definitely will go back to try their burgers and maybe I'll boost my rating. \n\nMatt's is A-OK in my book and I look forward to going back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI think Matt's genius is knowing where to get good ingredients and not messing it up.  I was blown away by the peppered bacon and the rosemary home fries. The waffle was good, but didn't reach the amazing wonder that was the bacon.\n\nBut if you're planning for a weekend pilgrimage then prepare yourself well for a super duper long wait, followed by quick rush out of the tiny diner space as soon as you're done with your food.   \n\nIf you want a nice leisurely brunch then go some place with more seating, or you can take the drive down to Queen Creek and stock up on that incredibly delicious pepper bacon from the Pork Shop.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is very good at Matt's.  I usually get one of the specials.  My wife always gives me a strip of bacon from her plate, and I must say, they have excellent bacon there.  It's a nice thick cut of bacon, which is right up my alley.\n\nThe service is as it should be.  No frills, but they get the job done.  That's all I really care about.  I'm almost never in the mood for the fake banter you get from chain restaurant servers.\n\nThere is a little bit of a wait, but people who are not originally from AZ are used to waiting 2x as long, so it's not really a big deal to me.\n\nI'd eat here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was excellent.  They need to get a much bigger place though.  The waiting for a table is toughest part there.  Its just way too long.  You can get a comparable breakfast at the Farmhouse in Gilbert and not have to wait that long there.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. Arrived for a late Thursday morning breakfast (11am) and only had to wait 5-10 minutes. Server was friendly and I had the chorizo scramble special. It was great! Very tasty and flavorful. I am one of the pickiest breakfast eaters (i.e. I don't really consider US Egg & Denny's breakfast places). I expect my eggs and all the ingredients to be fresh, and that was certainly the case at Matt's!! This is one of my two favorite breakfast places in the valley (for different reasons, I consider Matt's and the Orange Table to be complimentary).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me start by saying I hate waiting in line.  If I could, I would get an intern just to wait in line for me.  Having said that, I have waiting in line more than once for breakfast here.  The food is delicious.  I'm not sure if its the copious amounts of butter in the food but I swear it is the best toast and breakfast potatoes in town.  Oh and the main dishes are great too.  The place is tiny, and they really didn't spend much money on decor.  But really, who cares when breakfast is this delicious?!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe checked this place out after seeing it on the Food Network and it was delicious. The rosemary potatoes are top notch and the strawberry jam would be great on almost anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen to Matt's one time and that is enough for me to know this place is one of a Kind.  From the awesome friendly service, to the amazing meals, to the distinctly delicious honey lemonade and FRESHLY squeezed OJ, to the Fresh flowers on the table, Its truly a place I hope to make a habit of!\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't think I have anything to share that hasn't already been posted in previous reviews.\n\nThe food here is stellar - quality ingredients, great flavor, and nothing cookie-cutter. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Service is friendly, quick, and everything one should expect.\n\nI absolutely love visiting this place and encourage you to do so, as well, if you haven't already. I am one of the lucky ones who has never had to wait more than 60 seconds for a table - I'm not sure how that's worked out, but it has, and I'm grateful. That said, I would gladly wait an hour to enjoy some great breakfast fare at Matt's. I'm looking forward to trying lunch one day, too!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has horrible customer service. I had been wanting to try this place for some time. Put my name on the list up front, checked it three times. The third time my name was scratched off. In this hour of waiting I hadn't even been acknowledged. I love small places like this and don't mind waiting, but I would rather drive to Tucson and wait for a table at Franks or BoBos than go back and try this place again. No food is good enough for an hour+ wait and to be forgotten. Again, don't bother.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is delicious! I have been several times and you should expect a wait. They have several 2 person tables so if you have 4 or more people that wait just got worse. There food is natural and its so good...Its not too expensive either. The place is very small and parking is a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\ndo not be fazed by the massive amount of people waiting outside.  just put your name down on the notepad and make yourself comfortable.  the wait on a Sunday morning was 1 hr, which really is not all that bad.  turnover rate is quite fast.  the breakfast was very good and worth the wait.  i had the pork chop and eggs.  the chop was nicely marinaded and cooked well.  the toast was thick cut, with the right amount of butter (i.e. not soaking wet), and came with good strawberry jam with chunks of strawberries.  amazingly, even though the food looked like greasy diner food, it did not taste greasy!  i think it was the butter that made the difference.  i ate every bite of my breakfast and did not feel overloaded.  service was quick and pleasant although i did have to ask twice for ketchup.  seating will be crowded, but you'll be comfortable enough to enjoy your breakfast.  overall, a very good use of my sunday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 300 reviews? What can I say? Simply one of the best breakfast places I've ever went to. \n\nMatt's Big Breakfast gets an easy 5 stars. \n\nPros: Everything, from the food, to the service, to the atmosphere, and especially the PRICES!!!\n\nCons: The wait (expect to wait at least 20 minutes during lunch time). The longest I've waited was 35 minutes. Also I believe their honey lemonade (which is DELICIOUS) is $2.75 with no refills. It is the only overpriced thing on the entire menu.\n\nIn summary, if you haven't been to Matt's, you haven't lived good phoenix breakfast yet!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely delicious, fresh food. Wonderful, friendly, on the ball staff.\n\nMy wishes for this place are:\n \nThey would put an awning and some misters outside for while you are enduring the long wait. The sun was beating down on us and we almost left as we had our 6 year old....it was getting to be a bit much. Easily rectified with some more shade and misters. I'm guessing they don't bother as they get enough business even without them.\n\nAs vegetarians, when we get something without meat, and don't sub it for something else, I always wish the price would be adjusted slightly. Wishful thinking in most places, I know.\n\nOpen something in Laveen Matt. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Hog and the Chick! No wait... The Chop and the chick...NOOO, get the special! Ok. Just get it all!! Thick cut bacon, fresh squeezed orange juice, crispy has browns, fresh preserves on sourdough toast.  Oh man, is this place good. Yes, you might have to wait a while to get seated in this TINY place, but it is worth it! \n\nThe service is very friendly and very quick.  I enjoy sitting along the window with their cute little knick knacks.  \n\nI hear the lunch menu is just as good at breakfast, but I have yet to try.  I honestly wish this place was open for dinner...\"brinner\" is my favorite meal! ;-)\n\n\n\n\n\nI heart Matt! He must  be  some kind of food saint. No make that a food angel , well whatever he does, he has the magic touch. \n\n We had a super delicious breakfast this morning. My husband and arrived about 9:00 am after riding  the metro rail ( get off on Roosevelt  station   FYI )  waited about 20 minutes for our  table. We  had a great waiter who was fast, courteous and attentive. \n\nOur order of pancakes, breakfast sandwich, and omelet arrived really quick. My husband quickly exclaimed \"Oh my gosh this is so good\", and it was.  We were so thrilled with our fabulous breakfast that the family waiting for a table outside was giggling at us.  Laugh away we  are eating good while your party of 7 waits, HA! !! \n\nThe food  had a super fresh taste. The breakfast sandwich had rich caramelized onions  that really enhanced the flavor of ham  and eggs on a tasty soft roll.  My pancakes were light and fluffy and I secretly envied the ability to get them that light and tasty.  The syrup  was served hot and rich.  The omelet  was smooth and cheesy and literally was falling off the plate it was so big.  Did I mentioned Matt uses local  fresh ingredients ?We also had shared a sweet little glass of orange juice that tasted like you squeezed the juice 5 seconds ago . It hit the spot. \n\nService was well thought out and friendly. they could go crazy in that little  tiny busy  restaurant but the staff seemed to take all the happenings in stride.   Remember if you go ,put your name on the pad on the table out front as soon as you get there. If you have  a small party you might find a  place at the counter.  I 'd advise to be prepared to wait  but it's so worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nA-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food\n\nGood specials to keep things mixed up\n\nGreat company and service\n\nCons:\n\nGuy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes\n\nPricey for some dishes\n\nInteresting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.)\n\nthe fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass\n\nOverall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first few times I went to Matt's was at the old location and I instantly fell in love.  Cozy, friendly staff and bomb a$$ food! I mean that bacon, come on!   Everything I ate was always delicious and I loved that everything was made fresh and bought local, it shows in the quality even if it is only breakfast.  \n\nUnfortunately I wasn't so impressed with the food at their new location.  Maybe I just went on an off day?! Brought a few friends with me too who have never been and got tired of me raving about the food.  Sad to say that none of them were impressed and a few said they'd probably never go back :(  \n\nPlease Matt, if you have changed anything since switching locations please stop! I loved you so very much before and now it may be a while before returning again....maybe\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for being featured on DDD, I expected a little more than what I got to be honest.  We arrived on a Sunday morning at 8:15 and waited a half hour, which I was fully expecting from the other reviews.  I was underwhelmed by the limited menu but understand that it has to be that way to turn the tables as fast as they need to in order to accommodate the crowd waiting outside.  My omelet was alright and my husband got the salami scramble which he did enjoy.  The sourdough toast, homemade jam and fragrant squeezed OJ was what I enjoyed the most.  I would recommend to visitors but honestly don't know if I would continue to come here and wait as a regular.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as we got word that class was canceled for the day we hit road with one destination in mind: Matt's Big Breakfast. This was my first experience with Matt's; my classmate is a little more cultured that I am, so he knew the ropes from previous experiences. \n\nThere really isn't a lot that the general public can use for parking near the restaurant, but I used my university parking pass to park in the ASU lot right across the street. Even though we went on a Tuesday morning the place was still packed. But the 20 minute wait wasn't bad because the weather was as nice as the outdoors waiting area. \n\nOnce we were seated (in pretty close quarters I might add) our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately. I got the honey lemonade which was such a great (and different) combination. \n\nMy classmate and I ordered the same breakfast entree: the five spot sandwich with a side of homestyle potatoes. Sweet Mary, the bacon on the sandwich was literally perfect. Everything tasted fantastic and complimented each other so well. \n\nI will eat here again whether or not my class has been canceled!\n\n\n\n\n\nWell I have heard the hype, seen it on DDD and viewed the lines wrapped around the block. A few friends raved about this place. I should have taken note to \"who\" of my friends were raving about it. They tend to eat anything.\n\nI will not say the food is bad. It is actually good. However, nothing that requires this much attention. I grew up in NYC and we had tons of great diners serving bkfst, lunch, dinner and late late night meals. The food is freshly made. The most impressive thing on my visit was the fresh squeezed o.j. It was perfect.\n\nThe menu is small and I swear they don't have a green veggie or fruit in that place. It is carb and fat overload. The portions are huge. But I know this is what some people like and what they go for.\n\nI was bamboozled by a friend into going here. He suggested lunch and was paying. Of course I will be gracious and go where he wants to go. I guess a part of me wanted to see what all the hype was about. \n\nI don't usually eat this type of food, which might be the problem right there. I don't get excited off plates full of pork, flour, syrup, carbs and more carbs. After waiting 30 mins or so I was hungry and decided that I will pay for the meal ltr by a kick butt hike. Well lets just say no hike happened. I took an extended nap ltr that day. That heavy food sucked the living energy out of me for two days. Ohh Matt your big breakfast was so not for me. \n\nIf this is your kind of food I am sure you will enjoy it. If you don't eat this way often be prepared to feel like you ate a ton of bricks the next few days.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally got something I've never had at this place: Good service....obviously a Phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once, but new location loses some of the old charm.  Limited menu, but pretty good...expect a long line...\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE LINE IS HELLA LONG!!! so is the wait!! other than that I thought it was good..... Oh yah phoenix is hot.... and you will be standing in line outside!\n\n\n\n\n\ni'll review this place better when i can ACTUALLY GET IN. This is just like that stupid cupcake shop nonsense in New York after everyone saw them on that \"Sex and the City\" episode. I have driven past this place FOUR  SEPARATE TIMES to try to go have breakfast, but i'm not waiting with 30 other people to sit in a place that has four tables to have pancakes. It's just not gonna' happen.\n\nEither use your profits to buy a bigger place, or add a patio and some more staff! Having a tiny restaurant and a wait that big isn't charming, homey, or fun. It's silly. Fix it!!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you love a classic American breakfast, Matts is the best in Phx hands down. I've only been once, mostly because its downtown and the long lines. All their ingredients are local, organic, and farm raised. Their bacon is something I always tell people to try. Its insanely thick and peppered to perfection! I would go there just for a side of bacon! Their toast is thick and baked fresh. Even their OJ is fresh squeezed. I wish I lived downtown because I would go here every weekend!\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT MISS Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. Here's the deal, saddle up to the breakfast bar & get set for a terrific breakfast, served by FUN, attractive servers. Matt only seats about 35 customers, so be patient, you'll be rewarded. If you have some flexibility, stop in around 9:15 AM Monday thru Thursday, often times you can get seated with no waiting. A local favorite & well known throughout Phoenix...FUN !!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as the food goes it is absolutely delicious. I had the special which was a 3 egg scramble with asparagus, top sirloin steak and fontina cheese and it was very tasty. One thing I really like about this place is that they have fresh squeezed orange juice. I love fresh squeezed orange juice and it is rare to find it in restaurants these days - or at least at the ones I have been going to :)\n\nThe glass of orange juice was awesome but it was tiny. There is also always a long wait here since the restaurant is very small and cannot accommodate very many people.\n\nI am deducting one star for the wait and the portions of orange juice, but the food was delicious - my wife and I ate every bite.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was 45 mins for 4 people. We waited because everyone keeps talking about it. Man, was I starving to death when we were seated. I had the ham and cheese omelet and everyone shared an order of waffle with everyone else. The omelet was good. The waffles were light and fluffy. Good but not to die for. I personally think it was over hyped. It is good breakfast food, not GREAT.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's is pretty good breakfast. I am glad that when I went we had no wait whatsoever. Not sure how we pulled that off on a beautiful Sunday morning...happy though!\n\nDefinitely overrated. No question there. However there is a certain extreme eating quality to eating at a place smaller than my living room with other guests. I might go back if i spy the line is nonexistent, otherwise...there are other places down the block that are better and you can walk right in and eat!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent in today for lunch, and ordered the AM special. The special was originally a 3 egg scramble with provolone cheese, ham, and fresh locally grown organic spinach. I subbed out the ham for their amazing bacon, and this was definitely a treat! I got this with white toast and their delicious home fries (they're the best I have ever had). \n\nIt's too bad Matt's doesn't open more locations around the valley. I really wish they had one closer to Scottsdale/ Tempe. I would be there 4 times a week!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had heard about this place since I moved here 3 years ago... But had been detoured by the long wait that comes with the fantastic reputation.\nI had some friends in town.. we ventured down there. We waited 45 minutes. We weren't expecting anything great by that point, but were committed to trying it.\nThe gave us menus in line & took our order, so that when we sat down finally, our food & drink followed immediately.\nAs doubtful as we were after standing that long, I have to say it was worth every minute. Down to the coffee, everything was spectacular. I ordered the special, steak and eggs. BEST BREAKFAST EVER!\nLike me, don't wait so long to try it and don't be discouraged by the long lines. It is phenomenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to Matt's the other morning for a solo breakfast before work. I was treating myself because I'd been on a gluten-free diet for over a month and that was the day I was reintroducing wheat after getting some blood drawn, and I'd been literally dreaming about waffles for weeks. \n\nDiet aside, it was such a nice, cheerful way to start my day. I'd been to Matt's before for a Sunday brunch, and we waited forever outside in the heat. This was totally different: I walked in and sat down at the counter, no wait at all, and the waitstaff is very attentive and quick. I found myself smiling out at downtown Phoenix through that big picture window before my beloved waffles had even graced my place setting. \n\nWaffles: solid. Belgian.\nBacon: thick-cut and peppered. I could have eaten 5 more slices.\nHomefries: this is what I remember as being so stand-out from my first visit, and they did not disappoint the second time. Crispy, tasty potato chunks with caramelized onions and sauteed bits of rosemary...oh yum. And they're not even made of wheat.\n\nThanks, Matt, for giving me a lovely mid-week breakfast experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nEh?  How have I not written a review for Matt's?  I went there a while back, but thankfully it won't be hard for me to recall the experience!\n\nPlace - Small.\nFood - Fantastic.\nWait - Usually.\nBathroom - An adventure.\n\nWe didn't have too long of a wait when we went, but that was entirely luck. I've seen crazy waits here, which is just par for the course when the food is good. Most of it is local and very, very good. Service was fast, and spot on.\n\nThe bathrooms are next door in an old motel. Apparently a separate room set aside just for Matt's. Just one more stand out feature for a very stand-out sort of place!\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there was way...too much hype for this little place. The food is good, but it wasn't worth waiting over an hour to eat here. I was lucky enough to have come by here and while waiting I walked over to the Farmer's Market, it helped kill my waiting time and standing in the heat. \nNo joke that the place is tiny. They do have a friendly staff and have lots of staff to help with the crowds they get. So the service is good.\nI had The Chop & Chick, the chop was pretty tasty. The homefries were just okay, the hash browns tasted better. I also tried The Five Spot and it was good. There are lots of great reviews on the bacon from this place and...it is good, but I wouldn't want to pay $2.50 for a side order of bacon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fam and I were hitting some DDD spots last week in Phoenix while we were out there from LA, and we had to hit Matts.\n\nI've actually thought a lot about this place since, and I have to say I dig it.  It has a serious funky factor - it's tiny, loud and the servers are friendly and outgoing.\n\nAs for the food, the pancakes were rock star - absolutely delicious.  If I was on death row getting my last meal, those cakes would send me to the great beyond in peace.\n\nOther foods were good, and I don't get the deal with everyone saying the coffee is crappy - it's better than chain restaurants, so I don't know what the problem is.\n\nThere is one thing that's keeping me from giving it 5 start.  While we were there, about 5 minutes after we ordered, the power went out on the whole block.  To their credit, they finished our order, but the place heated up and filled with smoke from the grill (the fans weren't working), and by the end of the meal we couldn't see the back of the restaurant from the smoke.\n\nThat's fine and all, but someone called Matt and he came down and was stomping back and forth through the restaurant - walking around outside, back in, back outside.  The place was full, and it would have been appropriate for him, as the proprietor to talk to the customers, let us know what's going on - he didn't do anything, and we were all just staring at each other and him.  It was a weird scene - he could have set everyone at ease, and at least poured everyone some free iced tea, but there was nada.\n\nPower failures aside, the place is the bomb, and just what a breakfast place should be.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally got to try Matt's EARLY one Sunday morning with the family.  Luckily they arrived well before I did and I didn't have to wait very long.  The place is small, like previous posters have alluded too.  You don't get how small until you actually go.  10 tables and 7 seats at the counter, tops.  The waits can be long and now I know why.\n\nSo we were a party of 8.  The parents sat at a table and the \"kids\" sat at the counter.  The menu is simple with not a lot to choose from.  I heard the pancakes were great, but I like a little more substance with my breakfast.  I chose the special, 3 egg scramble with bacon, cheddar, and fresh jalapenos, rosemary home fries and a tortilla.  Not being a huge jalapeno fan I almost had them nixed from the order, but decided to go with it.  Glad I did.  It was great and the peppers added a nice little bit of heat.  The rosemary home fries were outstanding!  I know all of this sounds very simple and you could probably make this at home, but it always tastes so much better when someone else makes it!  \n\nI think this place is worth the hype!\n\n\n\n\n\nYum! Breakfast at Matt's is well worth the drive and wait. The omlettes are incredible and the breads at are so tasty you don't worry about the calories you're consuming. Most important to me is that they use organic eggs and produce. I love to go on Saturday morning and walk over to the farmers market afterwards. I hear Matt is opening a wine bar soon. Can't wait to try it too.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy question is, if the portions were not so huge would people still be giving this greasy spoon 5 stars. I guess if you are very simple in your tastes you could give this place five stars. It is breakfast with nothing special about it except for the names on the menu. \n\nI figured it out, everybody is so goo-goo over it because its trendy! O wait maybe its because you wait outside for so long that you are even more hungover and so famished by the time you get in there that a goat turd would taste good. One more theory, the taste of the coffee made the food taste delicious. \n\nMatt is very popular in the central Phoenix area so word spread like wild fire and he has been incredibly successful by serving good quality typical greasy spoon food, and I do think it is as simple as that.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love going into this restaurant. A dear friend and I would go here back in the day. I hardly doubt yelpers had even yelped this house yet. It has a super special place in my heart.\n\nI ordered up the eggs and bakie. Comes with tasty hashbrowns. The sourdough toast is thick as is the bacon. The preserves were awesome. Everyone is very attentive and pretty happy.\n\nCongrats Matt on the upcoming move into the old verde house and the front room we have been enjoying breakfast in since 04 becomes Matts fast food takeout. I wish you well. And congrats on having your very own bathroom soon, lol.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelieve the hype, the food is delicious! I recommend anything with bacon or the chorizo with eggs and jalepenos...YUM!  If you don't like the wait, have breakfast for lunch (its pretty easy to get in around one).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is AWESOME!  I usually go there for late breakfast around 10:30 or 11 after working in the morning.  The wait at that time is not that bad but I can imagine the long line in the morning.  \n\nWell every time I go to Phoenix for business, I come here for breakfast.  The OJ is AMAZING!  The waffle is AMZING!  And the staff is AMZAING!\n\nIf in doubt, just look at the pictures.  Viewing them made me want to have an excuse to go to Phoenix again just to eat.  My mouth is still watering as I am writing this.\n\nYou MUST try this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this place may be a bit overrated. I arrived around 9 on a Tuesday morning, and I only waited about 5 minutes. I was happy not to wait long, but shocked at the ridiculously small space. Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives really makes it look much bigger.\n\nI don't know if it's my roots in southern breakfast or the mediocre flavoring that caused me to leave this place without much of a lasting impression. The staff was extremely nice, and I loved the fresh squeezed orange juice. Just not worth me getting up extra to include the place in my stops before work in Tempe, AZ.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I have this thing about long waits at breakfast places.  Every town in America seems to have at least one annoyingly popular place with a line  around the corner and overrated pancakes, omelets, etc.  Having visited Matt's on two previous occasions I found it to be great, but because it violated my \"line theory\" I've resisted embracing it.  Until now.  After meeting a friend at Matt's for breakfast this morning (and waiting about 30 minutes) I can honestly say that this place is the real deal.  The food isn't gourmet or even creative, it isn't supposed to be.  Rather it's classic breakfast done to perfection.  Exceptional pork, eggs, potatoes, breads, everything.  Although it pains me to say it, this is a breakfast place worth waiting in line for.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, we went to Matt's based on the raveswe read on various sources.  Like the emperpr's new clothes, we fail to see what the hubbub is all about. I recently went to breakfast there and order a cheese omelet with home fries and wnet away hungry and very disappointed.  The home fries were mostly uncooked and badly seasoned,  The eggs were hard and disappointing and the toast was hard and cold.  This was very unsatisfactory and it is certain that Matt's Breakfast lives off its laurels and not the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally, Guy?  So I guess if it's featured by Fieri you have to go, and you have to love it, right?  This is coming from the guy who plans cross-country road trips to get my lips on some of the food I see Triple-D.  Sorry Matt's, you kind of fell short on this one.  The wait was way too long for breakfast, although I guess the place is famous now so it's to be expected.  \n\nInside, there were definitely more staff than diners, yet we seemed to be invisible.  We waited forever to get menus, drink and food orders, etc.  The staff were friendly enough and apologized once realizing how long we waited, but come on - it's breakfast, and there are all of what, 5 tables in the whole place?\n\nThe food was fantastic, no way to argue that.  Just a little over-priced for the experience that we didn't end up getting.  \n\nWould I go back again?  Yeah, if someone came cross-country on a Fieri food frenzy and demanded it.  Otherwise, I would stick to a little more down-to-earth kind of place, which I bet this once was.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, people! For the love of God, stay home! Do not come to Matt's Big Breakfast.\n\nYou will not enjoy the crispy, fresh hash browns. You would not like the weekend specials, such as huevos rancheros with fresh salsa, or scrambles made with seasonal, organic ingredients. A cheese and mushroom omelette will not appeal to you. They do not serve delicious Wildflower Bread toasted with most entrees. The coffee will not be piping hot and the iced tea will certainly not be tasty and delightful.\n\nAnd whatever you do, please do not order one of the waffles made from scratch. They come dusted with powdered sugar, served with warm syrup and a big scoop of butter. You probably wouldn't like it.\n\nIf, for some unknown reason, you found yourself at Matt's for lunch, you would not enjoy the Butter Burger. It would not be served on a delicious roll and topped with gooey melty cheese and a thick slice of tomato. No it wouldn't. The macaroni salad is not an excellent substitute for the kettle chips that normally accompany said Burger.\n\nFor the last time, please stay away. May I recommend you get your breakfast on at the perfectly adequate U.S-Egg-Good-Peep, or First Watch? The lines at Matt's are long enough as it is, and the regulars are getting cranky about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast - the most important meal of the day and the best, especially if you get it at Matt's!\n\nMy biggest dilemma at Matt's is only solved by deciding I can take home what I don't eat and enjoy it later.   Plus, I have to say no whenever I can to their yummy organic chocolate milk which fills me up before my food even comes.   It is truly hard for me not to get their omelets which are extraordinary.  I get basic ham and cheese and the buttery goodness of the eggs along with the \"real\" ham just make any other omeletes I have had just average eggs.  Then there is the frantic moment when the server needs to know if I want home fries or hash.    Ack!  Both are the best although I have figured out that I can take the home fries home pop them in a pan the next day and my house smells like Matt's and the potatoes make everything I make to go with them taste even better.\n\nThey have scrambles on the special board that often tempt me away and the beauty is that they put in what is fresh at that moment.  Everything at Matt's is fresh and they only use the very best.  My other addiction is to their pancakes which just blow my mind.  No matter what we get I tend to get one on the side to share with my husband as while I don't want to get just pancakes I can't turn it away.\n\nThe most incredible thing I have ever had there is the Huevos Rancheros.  I even had my name put on a list to be notified when they have them and short of a 3 hour drive back into town I will get to Matt's when they call!\n\nMy husband is a true blue chop and chick fan.  He can rarely leave the pesto crusted pork chop to order other things, and then he proceeds to nibble every bit off the bone which he assures me is the whole point of the bone.  He also scores my jam as I am not a jam person and according to him and everyone else it is awesome.  I have bought it at the market from the makers as gifts.  The jam goes on the bread which is another treat altogether. Sliced thick and perfectly buttered it also is good the next day.\n\nYes the wait is evil but you just have to manage it.  There is no doubt we don't go as often as we would if it were not long.  It is hard to go on most weekends as it is a 3 hour chunk out the day (for us drive time, wait time, and yummy time), but on Saturday's you can put your name on the list visit the market and return to find yourself top of the list.  Don't fear missing your turn for if you mark down you are going to the market they will put you back at the top of the list when you return if they already called for you.  My husband also ventures there during the week as a single and says he is seated within 15 minutes any time.  Please note he is a cruel man and he is told to keep his trap shut about these solo visits as my food envy thunders in.\n\nIt is a no brainer 5 star adventure at Matt's.  If the food didn't melt my brain with sensory happiness the adorable picture of the owners' son on the wall certainly gets my heart.  Matt and Erenia keep up the great work (and the cute aprons :-))!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy visit was a complete disappoinment.  I drove all the way from Scottsdale because I had heard such good things about Matt's, so I arrived hungry, and with high expectations.  \n\nThe restaurant was busy, with only counter seating available, so I took one of the available stools.  They are VERY uncomfortable metal stools.  The seats are round, unupolstered, metal, smaller than most folks butts (I am a small woman), insufficiently contoured, and very slippery. I had to pull the stool in close to the counter, wedge my knees against the counter, and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if I would slide off.  The hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that I kept looking around in to see if a table opened up.\n\nSo, uncomfortably perched, I decided to try the pork chop, eggs, hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The plated food looked good.  The eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter, I couldn't get enought salt without opening the shaker, and though I am not a heavy salter, everything needed salt.  The pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry, overcooked, difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided, and tasteless (seriously),   I could see that the meat was seasoned, but I couldn't tast whatever they used.  I didn't understand the texture of the hash browns.  The top and bottom were crisp and pretty good, but the middle (which comprised most of the order) was really wet.\n\nHungry as I was, I ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns, a little of the pork chop, a couple bites of toast, and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one (I can't handle eggs alone).  No big breakfast at Matt's for me.  I was too disappointed to even complain about my meal.  I just paid my check and left for the treck back to Scottsdale with no plan to ever return to Matt's.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're in the area and you have a small party, give it a shot.  It'll be good not great.  \n\nI love breakfast so I'd combed the Internet for breakfast joints to visit while in Phoenix.  Matt's Big Breakfast was near the top of the list.  \n\nFinally made it there today with my mom - not the most adventurous eater but game for a good experience.  She was turned off by the flies and the heat inside the restaurant but did enjoy her tuna sandwich and potato chips.  The tuna was tasty - light, not too soggy, not too much relish or add-ins.  It tasted pretty fresh and the bread was delicious - definitely not just out of a plastic bag.  The chips were a little cool but the pepper was a nice addition.\n\nI've read complaints about the coffee and I'd agree it wasn't that good.  Not awful but if you're open to other beverages I'd say grab something else when you're there.\n\nI had two eggs over easy, whole grain toast, and hash browns.  The hash browns were some of the greasiest I've ever eaten (and I eat a lot of hash browns) but at least we're dealing with real butter and olive oil at this place.  The potatoes are grated really fine which perhaps adds to your ability to see all the grease.  They were greasy but tasty.  Still, the home fries on a plate nearby looked equally, if not, more tasty.  The eggs were fine and the bread was delicious. I had to order everything a la carte because the only two egg breakfast on the menu involved bacon.  \n\nThere are mostly 2 seater tables though they can pull up an extra chair to some of the tables but if you've got a larger party, prepare to wait. There's also counter space for people who are open to sitting at the counter.\n\nIf you go around 1:30 pm, there's definitely no wait! :)\n\nThe service was friendly though not particularly helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, first of all - if you're not up for a wait, don't go here.  Simple as that.  The place is small and it's popular - put those two facts together and there's a wait.  In the summer - yea, it's tought.  Now - that being said, I usually go to a place just down the street (don't know the name, but it's a 30 second walk to the south from Matt's) and have a bloody mary inside (or you can get coffee, juice, whatever) and do my wait there while reading the paper.  So, this works for me - no big deal.\n\nOnce seated the food is simply great.  If there's a better restaurant serving fresh, sometimes creative breakfast fare in Phoenix I'd love to know about it.  But, as a Phoenix native, I haven't found an equal yet.\n\nI usually get the \"five spot\".  Simple, delicious and reasonably priced.  I've had the specials from time to time and they've always been good to excellent.  The service is attentive and friendly.  And, as someone mentioned, the juice serving might be a bit on the small side - but it's always been enough for me and I'd prefer the excellent quality over 8 ounces of something average any day of the week.\n\nSo, take your favorite paper, prepare for a bit of a wait, enjoy the great weather (much of the year) and enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Chop and Chick is Guy Fieri's favorite breakfast dish, his credibility has dropped a few points.  I wanted to like it... heck, this was one of the reasons I drove out to Phoenix, but the pork chop didn't do it for me.  It was dry and there just wasn't enough pesto to grab my attention.\n \nThe hash browns saved the meal for me though.  They reminded me of the way my mom used to make them: very thinly-sliced, a little on the oily side and extremely crispy.  I can eat this forever.\n \nYes, the place is small and the wait is long, but I won't dock any points for that, even though it was in 100+ degree weather; waiting is all part of the experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast is a nice, quaint little breakfast joint that does breakfast very well. A friend and I came here this morning and we were very much pleased with the food, the atmosphere, and the service.\n\nWe both ordered the day's special. It was a apple sausage scramble with spinach, a helping of hash browns, and some toast. Everything about the dish was very well done. The eggs were scrambled just right so that they were buttery, a lil creamy, and very fluffy. The apple sausage was just alright. It wasn't bursting with flavor and could've used a lil more heat or smokiness or something. \n\nThe hash browns are worth raving about though. The top layer of hash browns were crazy crispy which is always a good thing. But beneath the crust were some great gooey gluey but not soggy potatoes that perfectly complimented the crisp of the outside. The crisp:gooey ratio was flawless!\n\nEven the toast was fantastic. Went with sourdough. Always do and forever will. The jam was made with fresh berries. The toast was thick and well-buttered. Went great with the freshly made jam.\n\nAll-in-all it was a good breakfast experience. It wasn't the best breakfast in the world. It wasn't super phenomenal or mind-blowing. But it was certainly above average so I'll give it 4 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo after many years if wanting to Dine at Matt's Big Breakfast today was the day.  I have read the rave reviews and was excited but that did not last long.  The first disappointment was they moved up the street and gone is the diner feel I so wanted.  The wait was long, about 45 minutes on a Thursday late morning but we were finally seated and the immediate feel was less diner and more industrial.  The server was quick to the table with water and a quick rundown of the daily special.  My partner and I looked over the very brief and very over priced menu and we decided on the breakfast special and a lunch sandwich, it was 11:15 so we thought we would try some lunch.  Ugh....after waiting over 30 minutes we got up to leave, I was hungry and the staff had now deserted us so we were going to leave.   At this time a woman, I can only assume she was the manager came up and said the food was coming.  We declined.  She said she could box the food to go, we declined.  She then said the wait was our fault, you see we ordered lunch.  So sad, I won't be back i will stay a loyal customer of Joes Diner were the food is appropriately priced, the service is great and the staff does not blame the guest for ordering lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast is a place that I try to get to multiple times a month.  To put it simply... it is amazing.  I am not a big breakfast person, but I would gladly make time to get over there for some food when I can.  The Eggs Benedict and most of the specials are great!  I typically choose hash browns over home fries, as the hash browns are a little lighter, but both are quite tasty.  Most people overlook the lunch items on the menu, they are just as good as the breakfast items.  The pesto chicken sandwich and the big butter burger are quite delicious.\n\nWhat else to say... The staff is very friendly and attentive. I have never had a bad experience there and it is well worth the wait if you have the time.\n\nOh and do yourself a favor... make sure to get some Bacon (unless you don't eat bacon).\n\n\n\n\n\nWell this was a pleasant surprise.  This place is small, a little cramped, but the food definitely makes up for it.  \n\nWhen seated, the waitress was very attentive and coffee was served almost immediately. The menu is small, but full of all the basics, along with the special of the day. \n\nMy fiance ordered the special, while I ordered the salami scramble. They are served with toast (white, wheat, sourdough, or cinnamon raisin) and potatoes (hash browns or country fried potatoes). We ordered the wheat, which was served with a chunk of butter melting between the slices and a small cup of jelly. The toast was served almost immediately after taking our order and it was full of nom noms. The service is fast and you never have to wait for a waitress to come by. There is always someone nearby to help. \n\nThe prices were very good as well. The average cost of entrees is between $4-8 dollars and the coffee has free refills. The amount of food served is just enough to fill you up with out making you feel like a glutton.\nThey don't take reservations and the place is very small with limited seating so either arrive early in the morning or expect to wait a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, lemme just say that this review reflects neither on the quality of the food (fresh) or the service (excellent).  But seriously, I've had better.  Contrary to other reviewers, Guy Fieri is not the savant of Flavortown the Food Network makes him out to be.\n\nMom really wanted to try this place, particularly the \"Chop and Chick\" porkchop and eggs dish that Guy had on DDD here and the reason his face is tie-dyed sprayed on the wall with the words \"Guy Ate Here\".  We altered our exit strategy from the Armpit of America (aka Phoenix - 120 degrees at 8am, no sir!) just to sample this mythically delicious dish.\n\nThe parking lot is the size of a postage stamp, and while there are several sizable parking lots nearby, you can't park there because it's private property and Phoenix PD don't mess around.  Which leaves metered parking along the streets.  a quarter earns you 10 minutes at Matt's Big Breakfast, and the wait time is about fifty cents on a good day.  You sign your party up on the list near a ceramic pig by the door.\n\nThe restaurant itself is exceedingly small.  Get to know your neighbors, you'll definitely be talking to them at some point in your meal.\n\nI had the organic chocolate milk which tasted exactly like the kind I have at home, an omelet with no special ingredients to set it apart from a Denny's omelet and Belgian waffles that weren't much better than the kind I buy frozen at Costco.  The menu at this Matt's location (I was told there are three around the Phoenix area, each with a more expansive menu than this location) is very limited and the ingredients are too.  No substituting fresh fruit, they don't have any.  That Chop and Chick that cost us $3.00 in metered parking?  I doubt Mom would have given it 2 stars.  Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it wasn't something I'd do again.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh how I love a good breakfast!\n\n     My first experience at this quaint little establishment was this past weekend, my sister, her boyfriend....my girlfriend and I decided we needed a bite to eat after a looong night of celebrating....they chose to make the trek from Gilbert to our side of town...our first logical choice laying in bed with a swelling head you ask?  Of course we had to try Matt's...after all, we had been hearing for weeks about the bountiful breakfast that awaited....\n\n     I absolutely love something about a place that can make you feel as though your a tourist in your own town...and this one does it, very small inside....no waiting area except the side walk in front....you have to \"sign in\" on an ordering pad (cute touch in my opinion)...any how, after seeing what we were up against....I thought the worst, you know what I'm talking about....long wait!  Thankfully I was wrong, we were sat within about 10 minutes!  (Side note, I think we were a bit lucky on timing....as we left, there were a LOT more people waiting, I believe we got there around 9-9:30)\n\n     Ok....for breakfast we all tried about the same thing.....\"The Hog and Chick\"....fancy(kind of ;) way of saying eggs and some kind of swine....anyhow, all the basics are included here...potatoes (your choice, home fries or hash brown)  I chose home fries...and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised...with out a doubt the best I'd ever had!  Along with the potatoes there were onions and fresh rosemary....honestly the rosemary made them.  The eggs were cooked wonderfully....over easy seems like an easy fix...but its truly amazing how many times this can be a disaster.  My best friend had the ham....and let me tell ya...Nicki loves some good ham...and she got it!  \n\n     I have read some other reviews of this place....some talking of prices too steep....not sure where they were coming from, but all four of us....huge plates, soft drinks and or milk....with tip about 45 dollars...not sure I would classify that as \"over the top\"....not for a meal of this magnitude...maybe Denny's...but hey if you want that...you know where to go ;)\n\n     Only quark with our truly wonderful experience you ask?....we got the wrong drinks....regular instead of diet....other than that, the wait staff was cheery and funny...two things that are a must with me when I'm baby sitting a hang over.\n\nLike I said...I love a good breakfast...Matt's truly delivers!\n\nThanks Matt....I will be back, very soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy SJ buddies and I came here for breakfast one weekday morning.  Now I know why Matt's gets such great reviews.  The only draw back to Matt's is that it is just so small.  But then again, that is part of it's charm.  This is a tiny little house on a corner in downtown Phoenix.  I can just imagine what the weight is like on the weekends.  They have great fresh food and coffee.  I had the \"Hog an Chick\" meat and eggs....applewood smoked bacon...YUM!!  And the potatoes reminded me of my Uncle Ernie's potatoes.  So good with herbs and onions.  I gobbled up every bite!!  My coffee cup was never empty and the sourdough toast was .....mmmmm toasty.  I loved Matt's.  Just be sure to bring lots of quarters because there is nothing but metered parking all around.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really think this is the BEST BREAKFAST I have ever had!  The 3 times I have eaten here it has been an hour and a half wait!  Other than that I would give it 5 stars...Food is great, staff is friendly\n\n\n\n\n\nYou seriously cannot go wrong if you've wound up at this place.  Everything on the menu is simply fantastic.  When I finally ventured to have lunch here I got blown away by the grilled chicken sandwich.  Its really small though so you usually have to wait.  And its so small you usually have to wait outside.  Because its so small.\n\n\n\n\n\nHands down, best pancakes I have ever had. I would wait three hours for those babies! Went on a Sunday, waited almost 2 hours and boy was it worth it. I would suggest going on a weekday early morning to avoid the wait but I promise you will be glad you waited! You can also do take out. Oh, and get the orange juice!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place! \n\nYes, the wait is long. I knew that going in, so it didn't really upset me. It's not as long if you go a little earlier in the morning. \n\nThe service is great. The owners are warm and cheery and remembered me the second time I went in! \n\nThe fresh squeezed orange juice is super yummy! Last time I went I got the porkchop and eggs. Mmmmm....\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, I'm sorry people of Phoenix, but I will go here every time I am in town. I saw it on the triple D and had to try it. We waited for about 20 minutes on a (late) Tuesday morning. I ordered the Butter Burger with Maytag blue cheese and my man ordered the waffle...neither disappointed. The service was fast and friendly. Loved it! Oh yeah, the place is TINY, but who cares when the food is this good?\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm probably the lone dissenter in the land of Five star reviews here, but here goes. \n\nI wanted to love Matt's. It's adorable and close to home. \n\nI don't eat pork, which eliminated a good portion of the menu right off the bat. That's fine, it's not like I expect restaurants to cater to me, that's what my kitchen is for. \n\nI had the cheese omelet. It was good, but could have used some spices. The hash browns were ok, despite the fact that they were floating in their own grease. \n\nMatt's is great if you like breakfast with a bucket of grease on the side. It made me sick, so I won't be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn town to visit some family.  This spot is great!  very small seat area.  The food is amazing.  I had the pork chop, Yum! Kids had the waffles.  Honestly the best things i tasted were the bacon and the pancake.  Staff was very helpful considering my family put them through their paces ( not taking them again - they don't deserve it).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's one of those mixed blessings.. do you eat/sample at the Farmer's Market or eat breakfast here first and then feel too full to impulse buy from the market later...\n\nBut if I'm driving 1/2 hr from EV to hit Phoenix's Farmer's Market, then it is totally worth the stop here.  This place is an awfully darn good breakfast joint that sources from locals... the last time I checked:\n\nBacon -- the Pork Shop in QC\nJams -- Cotton Country Jams\nCoffee -- C4 aka Cave Creek Coffee Company\nBreads -- MJ (drool)\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing like a five spot sandwich after the Farmer's Market!! Still super tasty ...I don't mind the wait ... it's that tasty!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing in the Navy, I've faced two-hour lines for some of the worst meals our galley slaves can conjure up, since the other option was \"starve\", and walked away hungry. Back home in Phoenix, though, I'll happily pace back and forth for two hours outside Matt's Big Breakfast because I know in the end it'll be worth the wait.\n\nBreakfast on a fall morning is a particular treat due to the presence of seasonal apple cider, which is phenomenal. Same with the blackberry preserves served with your side of toast. On my first visit, I ordered the day's special, an omelet stuffed with spinach and mushrooms, though couldn't help snitching from my mom's plate--she'd ordered the Chop and Chick, eggs served with a perfectly browned pork chop. The hash browns--my god. Studded with deposits of melted cheese that oozed out with every poke of my fork. Amazing.\n\nI've only been once for lunch, but I can say without hyperbole that the Big Butter Burger is the best cheeseburger I've ever had. Cooked in rich creamery butter that calls to mind a particular episode of the Simpsons. BEST CORONARY EVER. I couldn't even complain about the presence of chips as opposed to french fries.\n\nI really don't get the reviews dismissing Matt's as \"meh\", I'd love to know what heavenly manna these people consume the rest of the time\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know those mornings when you don't want to wake up? When you just want to lay there and rot?  Well, next time you feel that way and roll yourself out of bed, reward yourself with breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast!  YUMMMMMY.  It's all you need sometimes.   It's like homemade breakfast served to you in a cheery atmosphere, even a fresh little flower on your table.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I used to live in Phoenix I would be here a majority of my mornings! The Staff is so friendly and the food is high quality. I always stick with the classic bacon and eggs with some coffee, but I've had friends get the sausauge and steak which I tasted to make sure it wasn't poison...and I haven't tried anything that wasn't good! Part of what makes this place so good is the atmosphere. A tiny, trailer-esque diner? Sign me up! If there is a wait they usually have some water or lemonade to sip on while you wait....but the table turnover isn't too long, so it's nothing to complain about.\n\n\n\n\n\nBright and early, there I was standing in line, waiting to get into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait was tolerable, perhaps because it was still early (roughly 8AM).  Although, this tiny restaurant only provides limited number of seating; they were well-managed and promptly operated.  In addition, the waiter was friendly and the service was just flawless.  It didn't just take the restaurant's staff members to provide customers' smooth dining experiences; the customers also knew the etiquette.  They get in, eat, and get out, making the wait bearable.\n\nLike the name of the restaurant, the portions of our breakfast were extremely satisfying.  The extra plus Matt's deserves is the reasonable pricing that is particularly easy on your wallet.  Both their breakfast and lunch menu items range from $4 to $8 - incredibly affordable.\n\nI ordered the five spots with home fries.  As the dish was placed in front of me, the smell of fresh rosemary had swiftly increased my appetite.  The home fries were buttery, perfectly cooked, and well-seasoned.  The eggs weren't as fluffy as I'd like, but overall the pros definitely exceed the cons.\n\nI'd definitely stop by whenever I happen to be in town.  Bottom-line, good food, good service, and affordable prices, who wouldn't be a fan?\n\n\n\n\n\nCome here for lunch (but not too late because they close at 2pm). Then, get the Butter Burger. Even the memory of this burger makes me giddy with excitement. It's freakin' huge too. A hand formed patty, and fresh & fluffy bun. Wow, this burger will knock your socks off. Amazing quality and flavor. One of the best burgers in the entire Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best parts of my career is that I get to eat around. If eating were sex, I'd safely call myself a whore.\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast isn't just my favorite breakfast in Phoenix. It's quite possibly my favorite breakfast anywhere. Matt and Ernie do it right, and Phoenix is one lucky town for it.\n\nWhen I work in Phoenix, I conveniently stay just  few blocks away. On my last visit, I made it into Matt's no fewer than four out of the six days I was there.\n\nYes, you will likely wait outside if you go on the weekend. Not so much on a Tuesday, but perhaps. You never know. It's not important, though. It's so worth the wait. (weight).\n\nHaving tried a good portion of the menu, I keep coming back to the \"Salami Scramble\". It's one of those things you may make in your own kitchen and eat too much of when no one is looking. It's exactly what you imagine it is and, when paired with their amazing hash browns, close to perfection.  If you're feeling hungry enough, the Chop and Chick is the way to go. A delicious, well chosen pork chop with eggs. Sigh.\n\nThe quality of the food at Matt's is memorable for its flavor, temperature and love which is clearly sprinkled generously on top of every buttery bite. \n\nBig Breakfast. Big Love. Big Belly.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaw this place on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives on the Food Network and I knew I had to go if ever in the Phoenix area.\nAs luck would have it I was out there this weekend for a wedding and this place was on my must visit list. Even at 10:30am on a Friday there is a line out the door for this place. We happily waited the 30 minutes and it was well worth the wait. The husband had the pork chop and eggs served with hash browns and thick hand cut toast. I opted for the breakfast special of the day which was a hot link scramble with fresh jalapenos and cheddar served with a warm tortilla and hash browns. I will go on record as saying this is the best breakfast I have ever had. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the tortilla warm and fresh, the hash browns were crispy (not greasy) on the outside and perfect on the inside. We couldn't resist trying the pancake made from scratch as well. Fluffy and light served with warm maple syrup. YUM!  We didn't have room for all this food but we wanted to make sure we sampled all Matt's had to offer. WOW great food , excellent prices and warm friendly service. This is a must visit local breakfast joint in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nGREAT PRICE, GREAT PORTIONS, GREAT FOOD, & GREAT ATMOSPHERE! \n\nGet there early and come hungry! \n\nI love the Hog and Chick with the best bacon around! Recently tried the Chop and Chick OK I fell in love with Matt's all over again. WOOHOO that's a good pork chop. Try the griddlecakes as well they are outstanding. \n\nI can't wait to try the lunches at Matt's but after a breakfast at Matt's I am full until Dinner.\n\nIs it something about the name Eric?? Eric M you don't know what you are missing and Eric N are you sure you were at Matt's? You cannot get a better breakfast at any Denny's on any occasion! Matt's is actually cheaper than Denny's on certain Items and well lets face it most of what you get on Matt's menu you cannot come close to at Denny's. \n\nThe hog and chick is 2 eggs cooked with real butter to perfection, 2 slices thick cut pepper cured bacon, rosemary new potatoes with onions, thick cut wheat berry toast with homemade preserves! All for 6.50! With great Coffee & real cream 7.85. \n\nThe knock off Grand Slam at Denny's 2 eggs cooked with margarine not usually cooked correctly, 2 thin slices of regular bacon, shredded frozen potatoes (hash browns) usually not even brown, 2 slices of thin wheat toast with smuckers if your lucky for 5.99! With gross coffee & creamer 7.98! \n\nI don't know about you but I prefer to pay 51cents more without coffee or .13 cents less with coffee oh and get real cream and possibly wait an hour to get a really tasty fresh like my grandma's breakfast, in a trendy spot that is bright, clean, and interesting! Than something I could heat up in a microwave and have some slob in a dirty uniform serve me in five minutes. \n\nAlso I feel the need to address the comment on the 8.00 pancakes that she thinks she can get at IHOP for 6.50. 1st I must also correct you Matt's griddlecakes are 6.00 not 8.00! Matt's griddlecakes are homemade not from a box, second they are lighter fluffier bigger and well let's face it just taste better than IHOP pancakes. 2nd Matt uses REAL MAPLE SYRUP.  So have your more expensive IHOP pancakes. By the way IHOP uses Maple flavored syrup not real maple syrup go ahead ask em. You cannot compare the two. Matt is in his own league. Top notch!\n\nTo all those who say the portions are small...I say your stomach's are to big. \n\nTo all those who say the prices are to high... I say if you cannot afford 9 to 13 dollars maximum with 15% tip, please visit the people making breakfast at home or find me a place that offers the same ingredients at the same quality for this lower price you speak off.\n\nTo all those who say I can make it at home... I say please do! So I can enjoy my Hog and Chick faster! \n\nTo all those who say the wait is too long....I say I'll good things come to those who wait, but great things come to those who wait outside MBB!\n\nTo all those who say Matt's is delicious.... I'll race you to the sign in and see you there!\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is great....5 stars.  The wait....1 star.  Sorry...no place is worth two hours for breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nHands down it is the best Breakfast place in the phoenix metro. I came all the way from Maricopa, AZ to check this place out. I'm not a native Arizonan, but this place competes up there with all the breakfast places I've been to. The pork chop is is awesome! I was lucky enough to be the last guy that made it through the door when it opened hehe.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverpriced. Bland. If this is what Phoenicians rave about, no wonder they're so unhappy...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is your typical American diner. Great hash browns, their jalepeno scramble is super good. Fresh squeezed OJ and their bread with their home made fresh blueberry jam was delicious! I will bring my boyfriend here before I leave AZ.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a true breakfast/quick lunch spot. If you go in there with 6 people, you dont get it. If youre mad you had to wait 30 minutes for a 2 top, you dont get it. If you dont put your name down, YOU DONT GET IT! But if you can just show up, put your name on a list, and patiently wait till it gets called you will be privied to one of the best b-fast joints in town. Everything from top to bottom just tastes fresh (mostly because their product is almost all locally provided). The Chop an Chick is a great place to start, a hearty pork chop that has been marinating in some sort of love, most of the breakfasts are served with your choice of gold potatoes with rosemary and onions, or hashbrowns, eggs, and toast from Tammy Co. Bakery, they also serve it with fresh preservatives. The special is always good and always different! All in all I drive 25 minutes to this place atleast once a month and I have yet to have any sort of dissapointment once. If you ask, wheres my toast, YOU DONT GET IT!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wait was a little long but the waitress was able to take or ordered while we waited, as soon as we were seated our food arrived. I had the waffles with bacon.  The bacon was crisp and the waffles were like cake, so delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.  \n\nAt 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries. \n\nWhen everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!\n\nThe whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.\n\nYes the place is small and you'll most likely have a short wait for a table, but get over that, because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here probably five times, but not for awhile.  The only reason for that is that, by the time I'm ready to get breakfast, I'm pretty hungry and can't stand waiting 30 minutes to an hour to get in.  Last Sunday, I actually packed a snack and sat on the curb to face 45 long, hard minutes of being tantalized by delicious smelling food.\n\nI had forgotten just how great this place is.  The service is super friendly and very efficient.  Once you get in, you get served very quickly.  I could swear that they laid down our enormous spread of food within 5 minutes of us ordering, and it's not old, sitting-around-under-a-heat-lamp stuff, it's hot and fresh.  I got some eggs (fresh and cooked to perfection), and wheat toast which was thick cut and had some delicious local strawberry preserves with it, but the standout is always the hashbrowns.  They are the stuff of dreams: a giant, salty, crisp on the outside/soft on the inside, just greasy enough slab of heaven.  Sweet Pea got his usual Hog n Chick that comes with the thickest, most peppery bacon I've ever seen.  And THEN we split a waffle, also delicious (not as outstanding as the rest, but I'm not usually a waffle person.)\n\nIf you want the real deal, a straight-up BREAKFAST - no frills and newfangled foods, but just really quality delicious stuff, then pack a snack and get to Matt's. Nobody does it better.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name makes my mouth water.  Matts Big Breakfast.  \nQuality food, this location will make you proud of what downtown phoenix has to offer and what is to Come.  From the vegetables to the meat selection hand picked food creates quality dishes.  \n  This location serves a  big breakfast in a small place. I look forward to seeing this place grow, do i hear patio?\n\n\n\n\n\nI grew up in AZ and did not know about this place until just recently from a friend's recommendation. This is the greatest hole in the wall breakfast I have ever had! Be prepared to wait or make sure to go grab a coffee so you are ready for the 45 minutes you have ahead of you. Also, you write your name on the list yourself outside (we were newbe's and a few skipped in front of us on the list because we were too timid to write ourselves at first until we knew it was the norm). Got the special scramble and the waffle and would recommend both again. Above all though, make sure you try the honey lemonade! It is made with local honey and has the pulp from the lemon in there to show you how real it is. Will be back soon, the service was great as well :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Guy Fieri of FoodNetwork fame, this place was at the top of my list for a weekend getaway to Phoenix/Scottsdale! My friend and I drove directly from the airport to Matt's, which turned out to be in a rather desolate location but easy enough to find. Our timing was just right because we arrived a little before noon and were seated within minutes.\n\nSince I'd been up since dawn and not had a proper meal, I went all out and ordered the Hog and the Chick (choice of pork product with eggs), plus a side of the pancakes! It was all fantastic--just wish I could have finished it. The bacon was tasty and the griddlecakes were amazing! They had this wonderful texture, substantial but still light, tasted of corn, and stood up to the syrup. I hate when pancakes go all soggy with syrup, but these didn't. They just stayed delicious to the last bite. Yum!\n\nWill definitely go back if I'm ever in Phoenix again.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's is good and certainly worth doing at least once.  The food is solid to above average even if it is a little pricey for breakfast but not outrageous.  \n\nThe real draw is the location which is next to the downtown farmers market.  So on Saturday you can hit the market while waiting for your table, buy something to strengthen your locavore cred and then eat at Matt's which is a hip reclaimed location.  \n\nThen off to buy some new Steampunk junk..\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid. Just had a trip to Phoenix to pick up a Diamondbacks game and tried Matt's Big Breakfast, well, for breakfast. I read the reviews for this place and decided to choose it based on the high rating.\n\nHad eggs, bacon, toast and the OJ. It was easily one of the best breakfasts I've had. When I visit again, I'll go back for sure and highly recommend it to anyone looking for breakfast.\n\nThe price was about right for the organic and natural foods they offer. It's probably a little more than most tiny breakfasts stops, but knowing the food served was chosen from natural food markets, the price was spot on for the quality of food.\n\nThere was a wait because the restaurant was tiny, but well worth the wait. Trust me, definitely swing by this breakfast diner. You'll be glad you did!\n\n\n\n\n\nI made my second trip to Matt's this week.  I took my wife for breakfast once before.  We waited for about a half a hour but the experience was very good.  So, I found myself downtown with my daughter who was signing up in the Army National Guard to be a Air Traffic Controller.  I left her at the Military Entrance Processing Station on 1st and Washington at 0530.  With alot of free time on my hands I decided to walk to Matt's.  I arrived just after it opened and there were about 8-10 people already inside waiting for their food.  I sat down and was served almost right away.  I ordered eggs and sausage along with wheat toast.  I then called my wife, who was getting the rest of the girls ready for school, to tell her I was at Matt's.  She was not happy!  Oh well......     The food was great!  The service was great!!!  My total bill was $12.50 including tip.  \nI then proceeded to walk back to meet my daughter and spent the rest of the day waiting for her to finish her paperwork.  She leaves on June 1st and I am very proud of her!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen here twice ...and both times were worth the wait.  It is a tiny little place with nice, genuine staffers.\n\nBoth times I ordered their specials of the day...and both times...YUM!! One was a scramble with Anaheim chilies in it....delish!  The potatoes were scrumptious too!!\n\nDo yourself a favor and check it out...if you can...go during the week...weekend waits can be pretty long!\n\n\n\n\n\nLong wait (40 minutes) on a Friday morning. Guess it's due to limited seating capacity. But the Five Spot and home fries were delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\nI definitely would have to give Matts a 4 stars max, could not give it a 5 stars because I do believe they are of a five star quality but lack any originality as say a Liberty Market. \n\nHave heard a ton about Matts and I do have to say that they have quality food, Went there and had waffles with bacon and a side order of potatoes. They do make basic food very well and that is a good but it is basic food. Nothing imaginative or out of the ordinary, so nothing to really to say WOW that is something new. Again though they do basic food very well which is harder said then done, and that is why I would recommend it, I would not go out of my way though just because of the location and the size of the place, but I only judge by food. If you can get in the food is very good even great.\n\n\n\n\n\nYay, finally got to try this place today. I had the waffle which came with two slices of bacon and I added an overeasy egg. Best Belgian style waffle I have ever had. It really is amazing. Butter was tasty and I even loved their syrup (I normally despise syrup). Their syrup lacked that really pungent smell that usually makes me a little sick. And it was a lot thinner than most syrups I've seen. Very yummy. You can tell everything is really fresh. Would highly recommend it. Service was friendly and came around frequently, but the wait and metered parking knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nI did not wait long to try this place after going to the farmers market. I have had way way better. The food was so so. My impression here is that folks who rave about this place have never had really good food with flavor. I actually find that a lot in Phoenix...PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW GOOD FOOD HERE!!!! Look at most of the bad reviews and see where most of the people are from. Yeah, not here with exception of myself but I am actually from Los Angeles and have had access all my live to some of the best food around. Matt's big breakfast is a big joke! I actually prefer to go to wildflower over this joint.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a late night out with a few college buddies, we woke up @ the downtown Hyatt starving for a hearty meal.  Einstein Bro's Bagels located downstairs, wasn't gonna satisfy our insatiable craving for some rib-stickin, home cooked food.  \n\nWhen we arrive, there are people milling about the exterior of this tiny restaurant, sipping orange infused water provided by the staff.  We assumed it must be excellent, if these people were willing to wait in the sweltering heat for a coveted seat.\n\nAfter 15-20 minutes, we feel like celebrities on the VIP list as we're escorted through the door.  I order the Hog & Chick, which provided more than enough hash browns, eggs, toast, and sausage to quell the lumberjack appetite I developed.  \n\nThe staff was friendly & fast, attentive to our dwindling water glasses and clearing plates quickly.  We were more than pleased with the meal, hospitality and price point--happy to walk a little of this hearty breakfast off, on the way back to the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing food. I travel all the way from Tucson monthly just to eat breakfast here. It's delicious. There's always great service and the food is the best. If you're in town, I'd check it out for sure!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was first introduced to Matt's Big Breakfast when I was a resident of Flagstaff, AZ, where waiting for a good breakfast is an everyday part of life.  I know that some people in Phoenix will not be able to wait, since they have their Denny's and Waffle Houses in their neighborhood.\n\nWith that said, Matt's Big Breakfast is worth the wait.  Waiting is good for you.  And the wait is usually not that long.  And, while you are waiting, there is stuff to look and see and do!  The Downtown Public Market is adjacent to Matt's, the people at the Coronado Hotel are pretty cool after you give them a cigarette or \"shfifty shents\".  \n\nThe staff is always in a rush but as pleasant as cherubs.  The coffee smells delightful, and the honey lemonade is the bees knees  The food is the best part! I love the ingredients that Matt picks, which are local and organic when the product is convenient, affordable, or rockstar status.  All the eggs are from local cage free chickens.  All of the jams and jellies (which rotate on a daily basis) are from local businesses and they will probably help relieve any allergies you have (if you live in Phoenix).  When I was a young Big Breakfast eater, I enjoyed the Five Spot and worked my way up to the to the succulent egg and pork Chop and Chick before graduating to simply ordering the special, and trusting that Matt and his minions will take care of me.\n\nThe specials are the reason why I keep coming back, and why I bring my friends.  I have brought out of town poets, musicians, and artists to Matt's.  They all love the diner feel, the orange and simple menu, the nice and friendly staff, and of course - the BIG breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing. Simply the BEST breakfast place in Phoenix. Always friendly staff, super fast (not the wait to get a table), the highest qualify food. It's refreshing to eat at a restaurant that clearly takes pride in the products they buy, and the flavor of the food they serve.\n\nEvery item we've tried has been beyond delicious. The only down side is the usual wait to get a table. They do a great job of being on their game, and serving quickly without making you feel like they are rushing you. This is a MUST try for any breakfast lover. Best advice: get there early, and try the griddle cakes!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nmeh. i've experienced better.\n\n\n\n\n\nWait, you're shitting me, right?  35mins+ wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and eggs?  No way.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just went to Phoenix for the first time this past week, and one of the must stop places on my list was this restaurant: Matt's Big Breakfast. This place has been featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. On the third day of our trip, my husband and I went here, despite warnings from my cousin that the wait could take hours. Fortunately for us, we only waited twenty minutes. Upon entering this tiny retro diner, I ordered the special, an egg scramble with thick bacon, fontina cheese, and baby spinach in it. This was accompanied by hash browns, homemade bread and homemade jam. I was very pleased with my choice of meals, it was awesome!! My husband ordered the Hog and Chick. This is a meal that comes with two eggs any style, ham, fresh bread and jam, as well as a choice of hash browns or potatoes. My husband said the ham was incredibly delicious. I tried the potatoes with fresh rosemary and liked those even more than my hash browns. Both of our meals were around $8.00 each. There were not too expensive and they kept us full all day.\nDespite working in tight quarters, the waiters and waitresses were friendly and helpful.\nBecause our overall experience was so good, my husband and I returned here the morning we left for the airport. This time we both had the hog and chick. It was just as good as what I ordered previously. I highly recommend this sweet little joint in the heart of the southwest!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWanted to try either the pork chop or the Hog and Chick, but it was Good Friday (meat abstinence), so I ordered the cheese omelette with Wisconsin cheddar, hash browns (extra- crispy) and sourdough toast.  Omelette, made with eggs laid by cage-free hens, was perfectly cooked, looked wonderfully cheesy, and tasted divine; and while the hash browns tasted delicious and were amazingly crispy, they were definitely GREEN in color... Very buttery.  Loved the sourdough toast, especially when slathered with seedless blackberry preserves.\n\nNew health ordinance (implemented just a couple of weeks ago) does not allow Matt's customers to use the restroom behind its kitchen (one would have to walk between the work stations and the oven-grill to use it), so if you need to use the lavatory, you will to have use the one at the Coronado Hotel next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the name of the restaurant and the line outside, I gained certain expectations. I was expecting a BIG BREAKFAST and amazing tasting food. However, I was disappointed. \n\nI had the Chop and Chick with home fries. This item was not worth the wait or the price. The serving size was small. The taste was forgettable. \n\nI also had the Waffle, which saved the experience. I have to admit it was tasty. I love a waffle where the batter is sweet and doesn't need too much syrup. Also, it came with a slice of bacon, which had a kick to it making it super good. Lastly, it was decently priced. I was close to saying that it's worth the wait, but I found out it's not too hard to make a similar waffle at home by just adding malt to your waffle mix. \n\nThis wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast, but if you're like me and you like to try places featured on the Food Network, just order the bacon. It's unique and different.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will not be back. \n\nYes, the food is very very good... but it is not the best breakfast I've ever had. \n\nWe waited outside for an hour.  There are only two umbrellas for shade and this morning, there was no water in the jug.    \n\nThe service could not have been worse--everyone seemed slow and apathetic. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we were placed on stools in the window where tourists were taking pictures of us eating/the inside.  If you need to use the restroom, they send you to the hotel next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast should be at the top of anyone's Phoenix \"Must\" list. All of the food is locally sourced and served up so fresh you really can taste it. Everything from their kick ass bacon to their bread to their coffee and juice will knock your socks off with their freshness. It is no surprise that even on a summer's day people sit outside in the heat and wait for a table.\n\nI'm surprised by comments about the service here because all of the girls came out to check on those of us waiting outside and even took our orders in advance so they would be prepared the moment we were seated. Everyone working there was very sweet.\n\nMy last visit was a sad one however because I was suffering from a brief but very severe hangover (what I like to call an Express Hangover) that was so bad all I could manage was a few sips of juice and coffee. If Matt's is in the future I have to make it a point to behave myself the night before because passing up such a great breakfast is a crime in this Yelper's book!\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG - eggs Benedict special was amazing!\nI usually try to eat somewhat well, sauce on the side, eat half, cancer causing sweetener.\nAll that went out the window when i walked in there this morning.\nLuckily there was a short wait and it was a great day out!\nPut your name on the list by the door. Don't come into the restaurant unless you know you should - it's too small!!\n\nThe staff is amazingly friendly and down to earth!\nWe were seated promptly when called, got coffee and oj (order the double oj, small is really just a taste!)\n\nHubby did the Hog and Chix - mmmm! Bacon looked amazing. Bread is thick cut and comes with fabulous strawberry rhubarb jelly. Mmmm!\nI did the Benedict and it was amazing - did i mention it was amazing?\nThe sauce, oh the sauce.\nThe ham\nThe home made english muffin - smothered in butter...  yes my arteries are clogging as i write this...  but wow!\nThe home fries with the caramelized onions.\nThe coffee with the organic raw sugar.\n\nAmazing!\n\nCute little location. Limited parking - but we walked so it didn't effect us much.\nShort menu, but super yummy!\n\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE this place and if I lived closer I would come here every day. I've had breakfast twice here with my boyfriend. I so want to branch out my order but both times I ordered the Hog and Chick with bacon and hashbrowns. Thick-cut, delicious peppered bacon and crispy on top, soft in the middle hashbrowns, what more could you want? The thick slices of toast with jam are a really nice touch and the honey lemonade is to die for. My boyfriend always gets the Five Spot breakfast sandwich that has eggs, bacon, onions and cheese on a fresh roll. De-lish! Next time we go I plan on trying the pancakes, I always eye them enviously when I'm there.\n\nWhen you get there, simply put your name on the list and the number in your party. The pad is usually on top of the water cooler by the door. Then grab a seat in the shade if you can find one and wait anxiously for your name to be called. Don't let the wait detour you, it's completely worth it. Now that it's cooling down the wait won't be so unbearable, especially if you're like me and want your weekend brunch around 1. (I've waited about 30 mins on average)\n\nThe restaurant is small and there are only a few tables but it doesn't feel crowded. The staff is super friendly and quick with your orders. You can usually hear some good tunes coming out of the kitchen. The prices are beyond reasonable for the quality of food that you get.\n\nYou will leave full, happy and extremely satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother DDD try, we had to come here twice. The first time it was just to crowded. Glad we came back. I really enjoyed the daily special, which changes every day. Also enjoyed the waffles. Wife and daughter enjoyed the usual eggs and hashbrowns. Very friendly service would come again!\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace is crazy good. Breakfast favorites that don't skimp on flavor...or saturated fats. Isn't that what breakfast is all about. If you're only going to eat out breakfast a few times a month, this is the spot. \n\nDon't be fooled by other Phoenix Yelp haters...\"too loud\", \"not worth the price\", \"I want to love this place, but...\", same old tired reviews left at all of PHX's favorite restaurants. Check this place out, grab a coffee while you wait, and hope the Matt wants to expand the operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, I will admit that my family watches Triple D.  Now with that said my wife and I have been to a few of the joints showcased on that show.  As many of you that have started this journey like we have you find killer places and some okay places.  Matt's is a KILLER place.\n\nMy wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning.  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge.  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spots.\n\nThe food is awesome!!  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning! \n\nHere is what we had:\n\nPork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries, side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly.  The pork chop is to die for.  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed.  Not at Matt's, it was tender and cooked perfectly.  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven!  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually.  This bacon would make anything taste great!  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage, fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble.  Once again cooked perfect, not greasy at all but with big flavor.  We both had home fries which were incredible.  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions.  Pretty close to perfect!\n\nThe next day my wife had the waffle, which she liked.  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish.  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm).  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak, eggs and hash browns.  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often).  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely.  The hash browns were very nice.  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle.  Exactly what you would hope for.  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly.  It was like butter!!!  Nothing like your store bought jelly.  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both mornings!!!\n\nAs for the service it was pretty good.  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant.  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad.  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon.  Very nice touch!\n\nOverall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants breakfast cooked the way it should be!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot as long a wait as I was expecting.  Great service and the Griddle cakes were great. I would definitely came back, when I'm in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery much appreciate the new space with bathrooms and room to move. And also happy that the food quality was not impacted the slightest. The wait makes it all the better. And that strawberry lemonade?! Whoo, tasty. Just lighten up on the ice! But for those who are looking for veggie options, they have a lil' bit, particularly the standard omelet with cheese. Would like to see a bit more variety without the meat. Otherwise great work.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaw this establishment on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives. Guy Fieri was raving about his termed out of bounds breakfast choices. Matt appeared very courteous. Not as good as they say. They are all right. The reason is there's always a line is because this place is so darn tiny. Didn't have a restroom available... What's up with that? Will admit the service was efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food's great. The pork products are amazing. The owner has a line on the best around. My gripes: the crowded conditions, the wait and, occasionally, the service, which seems to suffer because of the crowd. Two times now I've had to pull a Shirley McClaine in \"Terms of Endearment\" (think hospital scene and an ailing daughter needing pain medication) to get my coffee refilled even once. If Matt's has space, and that seems to occur only at opening, I'll slide in and enjoy. But I'm not going to get sunstroke for it, as great as the food is (and it is great).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 stars!\n\nThere is a huge hype about this place. It was featured on tv. I get there early to eat here with my brother in law and there was a half hour wait. While we were waiting, a huge line started forming to the outside of the restaurant around 8:30am on a Friday. \n\nMy brother in law had the special of the day, which was a chipotle jalepeno sausage and cheddar scramble served with potatoes and a tortilla instead of toast. I ordered the Salami scramble. I liked his dish because the chipotle sausage was spicy and full of flavor! My Salami scramble was good, but on the salty side. The salami was cut similar to fries, in long rectangular thick pieces. For some reason, I expected thin slices, but it was good all the same. The \"home fries\" looked more like a hashbrown cassarole and were much, much better than the regular breakfast potatoes. The home fries were my favorite part about being there, more than the salami scramble itself. \n\nThe side of sourdough toast that came with my meal was impressive. The toast appeared to be nearly 2 inches thick, and that was a single slice! It was served with a savory homemade marmalade. \n\nThe owner and the servers there were very friendly, and despite the chaos of the line of people waiting and people constantly checking to see if a spot opened up yet, the staff handled it very well! That alone I give them 4 stars. \n\nFor being a big breakfast, I'd say that my dish was just the \"right portion size for me.\" For some place with big breakfast in the title, if the portion is just right for me, that means that the dish is on the smaller side. \n\nAfter telling about my experience to another friend, who adores this restaurant, I guess I was supposed to order the pancakes, because they are ridiculously good. I've yet to experience those pancakes. If I'm in the area, I will definitely stop by this place again and give it another try, but I'm not sure if it's worth the 40 minute drive from where I live to wait another hour to get a table once I get there, so that's why I took away half a star, but I still really like the place.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince breakfast isn't my favorite meal to eat out (I like to eat as soon as I get up...breakfast is yummy just rolled out of bed), I had not tried, but  only been hearing raves about Matt's Big Breakfast for literally about a year, so I knew it had to be good...good enough to try breaking my fast outside my own kitchen.\n\nLuckily it wasn't too crowded (as I'd heard it might be).  We were seated at a window counter, but then moved once our food came to a little table by the door.  The staff was ultimately accommodating to the best experience for us. \n\nThe food was beyond delicious.  Egg salad sandwich with chips (I told you I wasn't a huge breakfast-out person), a waffle, and potatoes, and chocolate milk.  It was all SO delicious!  And SO MUCH!  We were able to take most of the sandwich home for later.  By the way, the break was AMAZING...just amazing.\n\nMy favorite thing I think (besides the food) was how friendly everyone was--from the staff to the customers.  It also was cool because since Matt's is small (but not too small), you wind up talking to the people around you.  Three tables joined in our conversation to complain about State Senator Russel Pearce, who led the slaughter of AZ's education budgets particularly in Spring 2009...but that's a different story...\n\nI need to go back to Matt's soon--it was a great time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome place. Be ready to wait because it is very popular place.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast is THE best breakfast in Phoenix. Fresh, organic, and wherever possible, LOCAL ingredients, cooked up to perfection. Delicious coffee. Crowded, especially on weekends. Worth the wait. Get there early or after rush hour on weekdays. Worth every penny.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some reason, we hit Phoenix on the first rainy day since October but that did not deter us from checking out Matt's Big Breakfast based on all the Yelp raves.  We had to wait outside for about 10-15 minutes in the rain, but finally got two seats at the bar.  When people describe this place as tiny, think 8 small tables and 6 bar stools tiny.  Do not try with groups...it will not work.\n\nThe waitress behind the counter was a riot telling people to \"Smile, it's Christmas!\"  She definitely kept the spirits up.  Our service was great, but we were at the counter where coffee was readily available.  First impression was that the coffee was great.  It is local, fresh and delicious.  My husband's waffle was really good but I won with the cheese omelette with mushrooms, onion and bacon.  It was full of gooey cheese and my husband helped me polish it off.  The hashbrowns were good, but a little greasy and the sourdough was perfect.  \n\nBottom line - it is worth the trek downtown if you are on vacation or do not live downtown.  Good simple breakfast with plenty of butter for you arteries to soak up.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery Phoenix visit, I make it a point to come to Matt's. BUT... once a year is just not enough. And though my time in Phoenix is always limited, that hour and a half wait for a table is worth the wait every single time.\n\nIf you're here for breakfast, order the special. You will never be disappointed. It's usually some sort of scramble, with fresh local ingredients. The potatoes with rosemary always hits the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the LARGE freshly squeezed orange juice. The small is a tiny little thing, and if you're gonna spend the money, spend the extra buck and get more.\n\nMy favorite lunch item is the Rueben. BEST RUEBEN EVER. And I've had my share of reubens. This sandwich is magic in your mouth. The last time I had one, I decided that I also wanted breakfast, so I had them add an over-easy egg in the sandwich. That was heaven in my mouth---- I still dream of that particular sandwich.\n\nA majority of the items on the menu are made with local ingredients (jam, bread, and coffee included). The service is ALWAYS fast and friendly. And as tiny as the place is, they turn tables quickly and keep everything immaculately clean.\n\nI love Matts. Best breakfast in the entire state of Arizona. Oh yeah. I just said that. And I meant it.\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously I've been here for breakfast.  I got the steak and eggs and I was amazed.  This amazement isn't from the steak or the eggs, even though they were both delicious, but it was with the toast.  I have never had such great toast before, and the jam was so fresh....\n\nThe wait was long, and we were there in July.  Limited shade outside, but at least they had a water jug for the people waiting.  I recommend preparing for the heat if you decide to go during the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee was good, orange juice was fresh & delicious.\n\nI had the waffle which came with bacon: OMG, my mouth was in heaven! Bacon was sooo good, covered in black pepper, and the waffle was soft and sweet and oh-so-good! \nBoyfriend had the breakfast sandwich: also very yummy.\n\nThe wait can be ridiculous. The place is pretty small, but it was very well-priced.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was in the downtown area and needed to have a good breakfast so I headed over to Matt's. I heard the food served here is organic and local whenever possible so I wanted to check it out. I was surprised how small this restaurant is but it doesn't feel stuffy or cramped inside. There was no wait when we arrived around 8 am and we were immediately seated. My cousin and I ordered the same thing coffee, chorizo and eggs with jalapenos, and hash browns. We downed a couple of cups of coffee and our meal arrived. The service was fast and they did a great job of keeping our coffee cups filled up.  I noticed the ketchup had a sweet taste to it I looked at the bottle and it was Heinz ketchup. It didn't taste like Heinz! I wonder if they add something extra to it ? The food is good but the atmosphere makes you feel at home and I think that's why many people come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest waffle I have ever had, and the five spot ain't bad either. Food is a bit greasy, and I recommend going on a weekday.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally good breakfast. The waffle was probably as good as I've had at a restaurant and the quality of the food was really good. I'd recommend stopping in, but as for now and where my travels have taken me it didn't dethrone Ruth's Diner in Salt Lake as my favorite breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nBacon O' Bacon!!! This place was one of those random \"let's see what's good in this area\" excursions. WOW. I was excited by the reviews and the fact that it was featured on DDD (secret foodie mission of mine is to try EVERYTHING on DDD). Well, it was worth the wait and had the best bacon I have ever tried! They were quick and attentive once inside. HOWEVER, I did wait for over an HOUR on a half broken milk crate I turned up-side down, outside in the JULY 100+ degree weather. They had one bench that seated four with some shade and the rest were out in the open. They do have a crowd and I understand a wait for good food but, it was uncomfortable. They also have an honor system scratch pad under a paper weight, that is barely monitored and I saw a few people try to sneak their names on! Thankfully, people who are hungry are ruthless and they didn't get very far! A hostess would help IMMENSELY or a police officer in case a fight breaks out ;)... \n\nOVER ALL- once I was inside, it was a good experience, fresh food, cozy atmosphere and great service!\n\n\n\n\n\nmmmmmm I just went here this morning for breakfast and it was pretty yummy. I used to come here about 5 years ago before I left phoenix, and it is still as good as I remember it. The place is super small so getting there early is important if you don't want to wait. So we got there at around 7:15 and didn't have to wait, but we did have to sit at the back counter, not a table. That was alright, although weird people waiting kept staring at us like we couldn't see them through the window.... anyway, I got the griddle cakes. These are so good. I don't know what they put in them, but they are better than most any other pancakes. They taste like pancakes made by your grandma if your grandma was an awesome cook. I also got coffee and oj. The oj is delicious, small, but so good. Now here is why I took off a star. The coffee. The coffee is not good. Despite this, when I use to come here years ago they gave you real cream to put in the coffee. That improved the coffee dramatically. When I came today they gave milk... not even half and half. When the coffee is not good, I need something a little more potent than milk... plus I was looking forward to that cream. Oh well. The bf got a waffle that looked pretty good and came with really peppery bacon. All in all, it was a good trip but if the Matt's people are reading this.... Bring back the cream!!! \n\nKthanksbye.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely adore this place. Matts' serves the best breakfast in downtown Phoenix!! I usually order the special which is always amazing!!  The toast  is delicious with their organic preserves. The homefries are also yummy. I love the local vibe. The owner is always friendly,  and greeting you with a big smile! Stop by and you won't regret it! Can't wait to go back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to sum up my own experiences and some Pros and Cons for people from reviews already posted, to give people a good starting information point.\n\nI had the Chop and Chick.  It was great.  If you like breakfast pork chops, this one is top of the line.  The breads and jellies are great too.  The hash browns, crispy and buttery.\n\nWhat I did not like is getting FLAT OUT RIPPED OFF with the TINY, TINY glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice they offer for $2.50.  I mean it's literally only about 3-4 ounces.  Tiny.  Grossly overpriced.  It's like they priced it like that to DISSUADE people from buying it.  Hate this about Matt's.\n\nPros:\n\nFresh, local ingredients, well-prepared and tasty.\nMany people say this is the best restaurant breakfast they have had, or among the best.\nPeople LOVE the buttery, crisp hash browns, and the home fries get a lot of praise also.\nAlthough the wait can be long, many people say it's totally worth it.\n\nCons:\nThe wait can be soul-crushingly long.  The place is TINY.\nStupidly overpriced orange juice. Fresh-squeezed, but JEEZ !!!\nTiny parking lot also.\n\nSo, ingest all that info, and decide if Matt's is for you.  \n\nHappy Yelping !!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome toast. Awesome waffles. Awesome coffee. The bacon wasn't crispy, but everything else was so awesome it didn't matter. New, bigger location. Highly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was underwhelmed with my experience at Matt's Big Breakfast, although I visited the place prompted by reviews from others.  The location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh, organic ingredients.  The breakfast fare here is nothing spectacular, although they do simple brunch foods well.  Don't expect anything fancy or fusion.  \n\nMy waffle was perfectly adequate, and while I thought the almost spaghetti-like hash browns were interesting/tasty, the rest of my table disagreed.\n\nStandard breakfast fare done simply, nothing to write home about.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome American breakfast joint, the portions are big and the ingredients fresh. This place is small so you may need to wait but going on a weekday morning before work is not to bad  of a wait. This place is a great breakfast place but please no parties of six because you screw the rest of us who want to eat too :)\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely love this place! We chose to go to breakfast on a Tuesday and only had to wait 30 minutes for this delish meal! It was a good time to look over the menu and decide what we wanted to eat. The menu isn't big but everything looks good! Since we were only getting to try one meal at this place, I decided to go all out and get the Chop and Chick with a side of the bacon and a strawberry honey lemonade. The food was amazing. Hash browns all the way! And the bacon...oh the bacon...and the bacon! It was worth it for me to get the extra side of bacon. Did I mention the bacon? \n\nI do have a critique on the lemonade. It was a bit too sweet for my liking. So i diluted it with a bit of water and that made it just right for me. I'm going to have to try other menu items...I'm not a fan of waiting an hour, so it might have to go again during the week to avoid the much talked about morning crowds. You gotta try this place if you are in Phoenix!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ate here last weekend and it was nice.  The wait was long but if you've never eaten there it's worth waiting for.  Once you get in there you'll see it's a fun place to be; a combination of hip/50's dinner with real all American food (especially breakfast).  I had the salami and eggs breakfast which was ok.  I thought the salami was way too salty.  The hash browns on the other hand are amazing.  They were made from real potatoes, cooked just right with plenty of grease and I loved every bite!  I also had a cup of coffee that was average at best.  My wife, on the other hand, had a glass of lemonade that was made from scratch and was sweetened with honey which we both thought was awesome.  If you're going to come here bring a small snack you can munch on outside because the wait could be up to an hour and a half.  Best thing is to call before you come and ask how long the wait is.\n\n\n\n\n\nCant say much that hasnt been said already.  Matts serves some delicious breakfast.  Yes its small.  Yes theres a wait.  Yes its worth it!  Bring a newspaper or a book, sign your name in and chill out.  At least now they have added a few benches to relax on.  Once inside anything you order will be fresh and delicious.  From amazing waffles, to the freshest fruit, to the tastiest bacon.  If Im in the mood for a bomb breakfast and have some time to kill Matts is at the top of the list.\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, Matt's definitely deserves 5-stars. \n\nDid I have to wait longer than normal for a Wednesday morning before 8 AM? Yep. But I knew ahead of time that Matt's has some hefty wait-times. (As long as I know ahead of time that I'll need to wait, I never have a problem with it.)\n\nThe service, once we were seated inside, was awesome. The waiter came over and saw that we were ready to order and didn't dally at all. He took our order and drinks at the same time. Within 10 minutes, our food was in front of us. I think that is impressive - for a place with such a long wait time, once you're inside, they get you eating as soon as possible.\n\nI had the salami scramble. I loved the huge strips of salami. The eggs were cooked perfectly - not too runny, but definitely not too cooked and dry. My friends had the chicken sausage with artichokes scramble (it was a special). They were both as happy as I was. \n\nMatt's is worth it. Go, have a great time with your friends, and eat a great breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat more can be said. Amazing food. Right next to the Farmer's Market on Saturday's. Friendly staff especially the ownwer's wife who noticed that we were new on our first visit and went out of her way to welcome us. The pancakes? Wow! 'Nough said....\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here a couple weeks ago while passing through Phoenix, and it was delicious! As mentioned before, there is a bit of a wait. However, we just walked around a little bit and explored the area, and pleasantly, there was no pressure by the servers to turn over tables once we were seated. The venue itself is small, but beautiful. The windows were large and filled with natural light making it seem open and spacious.\n\nThe food was also really good. While the salami scramble didn't particularly suit my taste, they had crispy hashbrowns and freshly made cherry jam to go with the toast-- both were above and beyond. I'll definitely be back next time in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nI miss Matt's!  I haven't been able to find decent, let alone great breakfast in LA. \n\nWhat I like:\n- The coffee.  Seriously people. What are you bitching about the coffee for?  I'm guessing most of you are Starbuck's frequenters that think over-roasted burnt beans = delicious coffee? That a macchiato is really a sugary drink with lots of milk?  That drinking a coffee concoction containing 1000+ calories daily is good for you?  That's what I thought.\n- The daily specials.  The bacon, spinach and cheese omelet they do sometimes is amazing.  If you are *lucky* enough to walk in on the rare occasion they are making French toast, well then you had better order it while you can.  Best freakin' French toast I've ever eaten!\n- The ingredients.  Fresh, local and organic.\n- The staff.  They are awesome.  Enough said.\n- The size.  I like the fact that it is small and quaint and that you can peer at your neighboring table's order.  And even say hello...try making a new friend instead of whining.  \n- The prices.  Perfect.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- That it is in Phoenix and not LA.\n\nTips:\n- Don't bring your kids. \n- Order your hash browns well done.  They are PERFECT that way.\n- If you aren't a fan of waiting a little bit, go to Denny's.  Or go early!\n- Don't go to a diner if you only eat health food.  It's not called Matt's Granola & Fruit Bar.....\n\n\n\n\n\nYay! I'm a fan! I tried Matt's Griddlecakes and Salami Scramble. Also tried the freshly squeezed orange juice and sipped on their coffee. \n\nHere's what I liked -- the griddlecakes are 3 stacked pancakes with \"mystery\" ingredients. It seems like they infused the pancakes with butter and milk. They place sweet cream butter on top! Please make sure to share this plate! It's very sweet and I could only eat half! They also mention to give real maple syrup on the side, which is a nice touch. I'm just a tad skeptical though if it is real. \n\nI do like their hash browns and salami scramble. It's a little on the salty side, but it is tasty! The orange juice to my surprise did taste great! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here after seeing it on DDD. The waffle and bacon were amazing! Got there right before the rush (Sat around 8am) so we didn't have to wait. They don't have tables big enough for 4 (it's a smallllll place) so we sat at the counter. Everyone's food was great. ONLY problem was for some reason, the waitress refused to give my husband water. I say \"refused\" because it turned into a joke but he asked her like 4x and still didn't get water.\n\n\n\n\n\nI heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here's what I concluded\n\n1. Space: first of all this place is really, really, really tiny so sitting situations are way too close for comfort.  I recommend small party with 4 people max.\n\n2. Menu: just because its listed does not mean its available.\n\n3. Quality: not so great, my hash browns were burnt (more like hash blacks) and the rest of the food too greasy. I myself is not a big fan of Fat.\n\n4. Beverage: uh, I rather go to Circle K and get a cup.\n\n5: Service: ok, but for such a limited customers how can service go wrong?\n\n\n\nAll in all I was not impress with this place.  I even went back for lunch thinking maybe it was only during breakfast that this place lacked the hype that everybody was talking about, but once again I very disappointed.  \n\nBTW i like my Burger with Butter and not Butter with Burger.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow great breakfast spot. My friends recommended going after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the food network and we were not disappointed. Being the norcal gal I am I called and asked if the line was hella long... the gal on the phone mentioned that around 12:30-1pm the line calms down. We got there and were seated immediately. Bonus points for having ice cold water outside too. This place was perfect for recovering after the previous nights drink fest. I had the Five Spot with hash browns and it was amazing. My entire group agreed I picked the best thing off the menu. When I'm back in Phoenix I will be back for the Five Spot again..\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter finally going I definitely believe all the hype. Everything I got was delicious; the pancakes, waffle, eggs, bacon, hash browns and even fresh squeezed orange juice. I got there at 9:20 on a Sunday and there was about an hour wait, but it was well worth it. \n\nIt is a very small restaurant, but that obviously does not stop the people from enjoying their great food. The service was on point, our food came out right away and when I ordered some extra things, that came out right away too. I would definitely like to try their lunch menu as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nGot 3 dishes because me and the boyfriend are greedy like that.  Eggs with salami was truly outstanding. Creative and delicious. Eggs and pork chop were ok. Chop flavor was good but a bit over cooked. Waffle was good, nothing special. Hash browns and home fries both pretty good, not great. Good coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was okay, I am not waiting all day for it though.  If I could go in and get a table right away I'd eat here again, but waiting more than 10 minutes, no thank you!  I would rather walk to Matadors or First Watch....\n\nP.S. Go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns, unless, of course, you would like some hash browns with your grease.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hash browns are an amazing butter-delivery system. The bacon was thick and wonderful, and everything was spot-on delicious. It was worth the 40 minute wait, but I wish they would have more outdoor seating for when you're waiting.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family and I parked our asses at the breakfast bar after a 45 minute wait.  And had a perfect breakfast.\n\nErnie was delightful to chat with, but more importantly, the breakfasts were spot on.  Great cakes, great scramble, amazing chunky breakfast potatoes, and am I imagining it or did I get served a bloody mary?  Hey, a guy can dream.  :)\n\n\n\n\n\nno place i would rather be on a Saturday at 6:30 a.m.  then at Matt's Big Breakfast -definately we worth getting up early for with a small group of great friends - the best breakfast joint in Phoenix!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been coming here for a long time, and there's been no dip.  Kudos to Matt and Erenia for holding true to the idea of making rad, no-frills breakfast food like they do back on the farm.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like, because the lines are impossible and I don't have the time to devote to an hour wait for Saturday or Sunday breakfast, but if the night before was long and I end up sleeping in, I have no shame about grabbing some breakfast at 1:30, and the lines are usually gone by then.  I will miss this place dearly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of those hole in the wall restaurants you hear good stuff about and is actually true!\n\nWhen I first arrived I was a bit apprehensive having to write you name with pencil down on a piece of paper that the hostess only checked every so often. After about a 30 min wait (Saturday morning) we got a table. It is a very small place but cozy and bright as could be.\n\nFrom the coffee to the breakfast sandwich, everything was great. As long as you aren't counting calories I would recommend it to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo....finally went.....and am graciously giving one more star. But that's about it.\n\nOf COURSE triple D keeps finding places in Arizona to broadcast shows from. Is this a big news flash or something? We should be the \"Wide Load\" state. Guy F happens to be a lard, so of course he's gonna B-line towards this shrinky-dinked, over-hyped and over-booked lil' nook that serves portions which could very well springboard the next season of \"1000 Pound Dad\".\n\nThe whole \"Reality Food Show Swoops In And Makes Dining Hotspot Out Of Otherwise Run Of The Mill Establishment\" is getting really, REALLY old, Phoenix! Get off your arses and find some places on your own instead of waiting for Food Network to whip you into a manufactured frenzy.\n\nI don't see the point of going, WAITING (and yes - it's true - they don't give wait times {get OVER yourselves}), and then being squished in seats and then paying for portions you can't possibly finish. How about more varied ingredients rather than a hunger-relief-in-Africa portion of potatoes on my plate?\n\nNOW I know why some Scottdalers adore and coddle this place:  It makes 'em feel adventurous. What's more edgy than coming to the semi-impoverished Roosevelt district, parking by a seedy motel (where \"those\" people live), gorging on local bacon and UFO size pancakes, and then safely returning home to the trials of spending the afternoon at Williams-Sonoma? Please.\n\nThe flavors are good, but not unique for breakfast. Pancakes were fluffy, but not better than my Pop's. It seems the hype is in the portions, the TV exposure, and the limited seating. People see a line and wanna go wait in it, for some reason. The food is so plain and the menu so basic that it behooves me to come to this conclusion: there's nothing new here, folks. It's breakfast. It's huge. And I couldn't care less.\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing but fat and grease! EEEK. \n\nGriddlecakes are great, however... everything else comes with fat, cut from fat. I'm sure it's good, just not my thing. \n\nBTW, be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait some more for a table. Come in with a bag of snacks if you're really starving and ready to eat. \n\nP.S. did I mention the wait??! YES!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the movie \"The 40-Year Old Virgin,\" there is a line they repeat often to Steve Carrell: \"You're putting the pu$$y on a pedestal, that's your problem!\"\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast was on a pedestal. We'd tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked \"What's the probable wait time?\" We were told, \"Oh we don't really provide anyone with wait times.\" The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn't really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we'd turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table. \n\nThen this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said \"Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now.\"\n\nI just came back from breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast and now I'm waiting for my heart attack.\n\nI'd tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the \"traditional breakfast food\" so \"different.\"\n\nI ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.\n\nThe omelette was more like \"Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese.\" The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They're not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they're ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?\n\nI'm one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to \"go there\" at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I'll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?\n\nIt was a'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people's palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don't know. The ingredients were definitely \"real,\" which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny's. It most definitely beats \"Moons Over My Hammy\" for instance.\n\nBut we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.\n\nThe bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it's BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said \"That's a tasty plate of diabetes right there,\" while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.\n\nMostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department. \n\nI might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I'm not. I'm a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick's Hideaway several times a week. It's just that at Dick's Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I'm used to having an entire day's worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I'll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won't eat meat for meat's sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn't an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.\n\nThe \"thick-cut bacon\" that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper. It was good, but it was also bacon ... bacon SHOULD be good, it's hard to do bad.\n\nI see the trendy hipster appeal everywhere - orange countertops, orange everywhere, down to the stapler on the counter, the 1950's signs that say \"Eggs!\" and stuff. Whatever. I get it, it's better than Denny's, and it's better than 5 & Diner. It's NOT \"The Best\" and it's most definitely not worth standing around outside in no shade, without any idea how long the wait will be for a table, like a sucker.\n\nThe chalkboard on the wall inside says \"Visit our bar The Roosevelt around the corner.\" I hadn't known they own the Roosevelt. I recommend going to the Roosevelt and waiting around for a seat there, where it's worth the wait.\n\nI'm glad I finally went, to knock the place off its pedestal. Now I just need to wait like a month or something for my arteries to un-clog.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5-4 stars.\nBumped up the rating because the servers were so nice considering how crazy/busy it was.\n\nSmall hole-in-the-wall breakfast place. Loved the cranberry walnut bread. Coffee was good. Had the 3 egg, mozzarella, spinach special which was good. Nicely made home fries & hash. Fast but very friendly service.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany reviewers indicate that it's worth the wait, and I MUST wholeheartedly agree!\n\nKnowing there would probably be a wait on a Sunday morning, my co-workers and I hustled ourselves out of bed a little earlier than we otherwise would have, checked out of our hotel, called for the valet to bring our car, and drove to Matt's.\n\nI was frankly surprised at how very tiny the building was - I knew it was small, but WOW!  There didn't seem to be *too* many people waiting before us, so we put our names on the list.\n\nWe waited probably 45 minutes, and were very glad that it hadn't gotten truly HOT out yet.  Once inside, the place looks even smaller than it did from outside.  We were seated at the bar, which honestly looked a lot less cramped than some of the other tables with \"large\" parties (read: more than 2-3 people).  I think the entire place might seat 20 people?\n\nWe were immediately asked for our drink orders (coffee, orange juice and water), then our food orders.\n\nI should have paid more attention to what my co-workers ordered (I know Hayden and Sheri shared an order of pancakes and bacon, and maybe something else, while John also had pancakes and something else with hash browns), but seriously?  Once my Belgian Waffle arrived, there was little room for me to pay attention to anything else.  \n\nI can't say I consider myself a connossieur of waffles or anything like that, but I've truly never tried another waffle that even comes close to comparing to this one.  The consistency was absolute PERFECTION!  It was crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and the texture was hearty enough to hold up to the (real!) butter and (real maple!) syrup I subjected it to.\n\nOh, yeah, I also had the thick-cut bacon.  It was just a little too peppery and a little too done for my taste, but it was still quite good.  John declared the hash browns to be the best he'd ever had, and the pancakes got the same pronouncement from Hayden and Sheri.\n\nService was spot-on and cheerful.\n\nThere's just a couple things I would change about Matt's if I had the opportunity:\n\nA) Expand.  With the demand, they could easily seat and serve twice or even three times as many customers and still have a wait on weekends!\n\nB) Get a public restroom.  My very first desire upon leaving was to find a restroom!\n\nC) Relocate.  Seriously, Austin needs a place this good!!!  I know at least 4 people who would ensure good business forever after...\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a unique appreciation for smaller, urban, phoenix based spots.  Matt's Big Breakfast was recommended from a few people in my building.  I went there a few days ago and the wait was atrocious.  When I got to my table I was given a menu.  The food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out.  The waiter seemed too involved with tasks that I assume far surpassed customer satisfaction in importance.  At best, this was a drawn out version of an old, unmaintained, dirty Denny's.  I will not return.\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic breakfast and very good service. The cafe is also very clean. Can't wait to come back and try something new.\n\n\n\n\n\nI finally made the great Breakfast pilgrimage.  It was worth every minute of the wait.  We put in our names, and walked over to the downtown market to kill some time.  We still had to wait about 15 minutes after that, but it was a great way to go.  Highly suggest it.  \n\nThe best pancakes I've ever had.  Ever.  And the home fries?  I could eat just a big bowl of that and be happy.  Great rosemary taste.  Really loved the coffee. Yummy peppery bacon.  One of our companions said the ham was the best she'd had since she's lived in Tennessee more than 15 years ago.  \n\nRight before we left, we saw someone served a hamburger and we could hardly move.  It was the best looking burger I've ever seen.  We will TOTALLY be back just for lunch. Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmmm...  \n\nBut Matt himself cracking jokes with the patrons and chatting with downtown neighbors walking by was awesome.  While the food felt made with love, the big guy's personality totally put it over the top. You love supporting him supporting downtown.  Its the kind of business you would almost like to go even if it wasn't that good.  But thank goodness - it is that good.  Can't wait to go back.  \n\nVery.  Very.  Soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Matt's. I hate the wait. But if you have the patience, it's worth it. Really yummy hash browns, waffles, and I am never disappointed with their specials. Irenia is super nice and remembers her regulars which makes it feel less like a conveyer belt of customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nhmm...Well, I loved the breakfast at this adorable little joint.  Unfortunately, I am not a fan of waiting an hour and a half outside in the heat.  I also do wish they had a larger menu, but oh well.  thats what makes this place, right?  anyway, I will definitely come back again, but not if i am stuck waiting outside in the heat.  ...but i should probably get to the point.  I had the breakfast sandwhich (sorry I cant remeber its name :(  ) and my friend had just a regular belgian waffle.  both were delicious.  OH YEAH!!  and they offer fresh squeezed OJ.  that was one of my favorite parts.  When we were all said and done, we left with a $30 bill including tip.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favorite breakfast place.  Love the food, love the prices, love the decor.  But...\n\nHATE THE WAIT.\n\nThey know me.  My wife and I bring our two small kids here every week or two.  But our AVERAGE wait time, sitting in front on nice modernist benches, is about 25 minutes.  \n\nIt sucks.  I wish they would get rid of two rows of parking, put up an overhead tent with heaters/misters.\n\nBut I think the fact that people have to wait actually increases the love of the place?  Strange, huh.\n\nFood is delicious.  I love the aged cheese omelet.  Go for the home fries, which are delicious and dusted with fresh rosemary, over the overly buttery hash browns.  Almost everything on the menu is perfect.  My kids do a single pancake, perfectly cooked, with great syrup.  \n\nTheir bread may be the best part.  Fresh, thick cut bread with butter and fresh jam/jelly.\n\nLook, it's a slightly upscale \"diner food\" that is well worth every $ you spend and every calorie you consume.  \n\nI hate to give a good review... what if even MORE people come and my wait is even LONGER... :(\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hearing rave reviews, we finally went to try for first time.  Between the long wait time just to be seated, poor service, the constant waiting and having to ask for refills.  We even went to the front and asked for our check rather than continuing to wait for it.  The food was good no doubt about it, but with as much hypster hype as there has been about Matt's Big Breakfast, we expected better.  Probably wont be back....\n\n\n\n\n\nyep, good ol' simple home cooking, and by 'home cooking' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving.\n\nif you've never gone, don't be scared off by all the butter references, it's not that bad. the place is teeny tiny, and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place, parties of more than four, you'll probably have to get split up. \n\nthe omelettes are wonderful, and the rosemary home fries are too good. the bacon is so good.. i can't even describe it. let me stress i am NOT a pork fan, and rarely eat it. i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i'm so picky about it. everyone raved about it here, so i dived in and thought, 'what have i been missing my whole life?' ha ha, yeah, i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint! seriously, it's unbelievable.\nit's worth the trek no matter where you're coming from, especially on a sat morning. afterward we checked out a small famer's market that was going on right up the street, and then popped in Circles records and tapes, also within walking distance.\n\n***Update 3/8\nI just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes. i was ok with it, but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food, which kind of put a damper on things. def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust got home from eating at Matt's Big Breakfast. Waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated which wasn't too bad. However, after trying the food, I don't think it would be worth it to wait beyond 15 minutes especially during the summer months to eat here. \nTo start, the menu is a little too small and was missing some key breakfast essentials I thought. Biscuits and gravy... Hello? Anyways, I decided on the chick and chop meal with hash browns, over easy eggs, and sourdough toast. The chop was really dry and tough and at times, flavorless. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns, though really greasy, were some of the best I have ever had. The toast didn't taste much like sourdough to me but the home made peach preserves were pretty legit. My husband on the other hand liked the toast. I also ordered a small fresh squeezed OJ. Maybe its just me but I almost felt I would have rather had something from a bottle. Something just didn't taste right to me about the OJ. Lots of pulp, so if you like to chew your OJ, then you might enjoy it. The husband opted for the special: 3 meat scramble with cheese and fresh jalapeno's, hash browns, and tortilla. He said it was alright but was a little weirded out that one of the meats was bologna. \nAll in all, the prices were not too bad. We felt they were a little skimpier on their portions than other places particularly with the amount of hash browns and the toast. For a place calling itself \"big breakfast,\" I guess I expected more. Would we go back? Being that we are from Maricopa, this is pretty far for us to travel for breakfast so probably not anytime soon. The wait that is almost always present also doesn't seem worth it for a place that had nothing memorable to me other than their hash browns and peach preserves. Maybe if we are in the area and its not summer though...\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people say Matt's is small, they're right.  I think there are maybe 8 tables and some stools up at the bar and that's about it.   Also, don't expect to walk right in & grab a seat.  Popular spot + tiny place = waiting (we waited about 45 minutes for a table for 2).  Thankfully, it was a pretty nice day, though there isn't a whole heckuva lot to explore in the area.\n\nPlusses:  \n-They serve RC cola!  Fun times.  I haven't had an RC since I was a kid.\n-Their waffle is really good.   Light, sweet, buttery deliciousness.  \n-Small place = intimate setting.  It's a good place for conversation, at least in a small group setting.\n\nMinuses: \n-The place, and my silverware, weren't especially clean.  Having a knife that's gunky doesn't make me want to eat.\n-The bacon was underdone.  I like chewy bacon, but mine was almost oinking.  I'll take a steak medium-rare, but please not the bacon.\n-The aforementioned RC cola gets served to you in can form. \n\nAll-in-all, the food was pretty good, but not a place I'd wait outside for 45 minutes for.  \n\n3.5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no \"big breakfast\". Matt told me himself. What you will get is a delicious, fresh, locally grown breakfast served by really nice people. Line was super long and I thought servings were average so I gave it three stars. Really nice place and I definately recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to matt's the other day to see what the rave is about and just as I expected nothing but self perpetuated hype with the help of the food network nothing more. The service was ok the coffee nothing special and my hog and chick was very unremarkable at best. It was not that the food was bad, however, if you can't be seated right away it's not worth the wait. This is not a special place. No gem to find her just pricey breakfast food and there are other choices that you can do better with. I saw a guy paying for his breakfast using three different credit cards....I mean what did he eat? And how much did it cost!!!!?? Anyway, if you are into over hyped breakfast joints and food that is mediocre at best then you may like matt's. Nothing against them but you guys are not all that when it comes to what you serve and your 15 minutes of fame has long been expired. Making people wait to eat here is nothing more then for show..trust me this is my review and I was seated right away just imagine if I had to wait in line what the review would say. Save your money and look elsewhere for the start of your day. I give matt's 5 stars for boring me with their breakfast and coffee and I give them another 5 stars for being able to convince people to pay over five dollars for a lacluster breakfast which amounts to culinary rape of one's taste buds. Do yourself a favor when you pass by this \nplace and your hungry just drive past and go to any other nearby spot that won't   Molest your good senses.\n\nTo make it you have to rely on your food and staff........not guy fieti and the food network!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aptly named Big Breakfast isn't the only thing they should be famous for. The food is not only generous, its fresh. The potatoes are home made (nothing processed here) and the bread appears as if its never seen a bag in its life. \n\nThey kept the coffee coming! \n\nWe didn't wait at ALL on Tuesday at 7AM so if you work downtown, do yourself a favor and hit Matt's before work one day..you'll beat the traffic, the Saturday lines and be so full, you probably won't need much of a lunch. \n\nIn short: fresh food, tall coffee, tasty treat. Well worth it. Even with a wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat breakfast down to the toast. Delicious fresh-squeezed OJ and the Hash browns were to die for. Ham was a bit tough to cut but good flavor. Was traveling alone for work and enjoyed sitting at one of he window seats. Imagine there'd be quite a wait if it hadn't been 645AM on a week day. Will recommend to friends passing through PHX for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I have raved about this place in the past, I wanted to once again extol the virtues and, more importantly, the family feel of this place. Ernie lights up the room with her smile. Once that happens, the coffee is served, and the service begins then the rest of the breakfast is just a wonderful continuation. Peg and I went for my birthday (actually, we try to extend family occasions so that we can visit the family of chefs with whom we have grown since we moved here in '97). The OJ was fresh, the specials are always superb, and there is a continuity in the kitchen that virtually assures that the quality will be stellar.  We can't wait for the new addition this month, and Peg and I always will support Matt, Ernie, and of course Christopher!  Dr. B\n\n\n\n\n\nYou gotta love Matts Big Breakfast...a simple menu with the freshest ingredients, good service, and a cozy down home setting that makes you feel like you're eating in Grandma's kitchen. We got lucky on our last visit b/c it was later in the day and drizzling outside, so there was no wait at all and we got right in. I don't think I would try to go here during peak hours on a Saturday or Sunday morning, unless you like waiting a while to get seated. \n\nWe ordered the Salami Scramble (good) and the Waffle (great), along with a side of bacon. Their bacon is definitely one of the best in all of Phoenix, that's for sure. It's flavorful and juicy and crisp all at the same time. \n\nI don't think I would change a thing about this place, except for the sketchy location that it is in. It's kind of artsy fartsy and trendy on the one hand, but then on the other hand there are about 5 crack dens surrounding it. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be there alone at night.....hence why it is a breakfast place I guess. We actually experienced some of the shadiness first hand when we went to the hotel next door to go pee after our meal (no bathroom in the place). There was a torn up hooker in her 50's arguing with the lady at the check in desk about money with some guy who was missing all of his front teeth. There was obviously something illegal about to do down in one of the rooms, so we peed as quickly and quietly as we could and left the scene before we could get shot. Even so, getting shot is definitely worth the risk for some of their delicious food!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I made it to the Farmer's Market early on a Saturday, which is quite a feat, so we decided to reward ourselves with breakfast across the street.  We'd heard great things about Matt's and I always see a crowd of people waiting outside.   He waited for our table while I shopped across the way at the farmer's market.  While he was waiting he went inside and asked for a cup of coffee.  He was told that they only sell coffee with to-go orders, so he asked for a coffee \"to go\".  He was turned down, so he walked across the street to the farmer's market and bought some coffee from a stand.  When our table was ready, they made him stand outside to finish his coffee because they have a strict \"no outside food or drink\" rule.  Pretty lame.  As far as the food, I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and fontina cheese.  My husband had an omelet with hard salami.  While the food was good, it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home.  The star of the meal was the locally made fresh strawberry preserves, but nobody told us that was coming and it didn't go too well with my husband's sourdough toast.  A heads up would have been nice.\n\nI think part of the allure of this place is the fact that there is almost always a crowd of people waiting outside.   There's very little chance I'll ever join them.  I'll stick to the breakfast gyros and free samples across the way at the farmer's market.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor so long I have been encouraged to explore the breakfast happenings at this local spot in Phoenix.  I believe I am going to be one of the few who was not wowed by what Matt had to offer.\n\nMatt's gets a big gold star for its earth friendly and locavore kitchen.  The menu features \"cage free eggs from humanely raised chickens\", grain fed pork and natural beef, as well as local organic produce.\n\nYou will only find a breakfast and lunch menu here, and the items are unpretentious and down-home - virtually anything I could easily whip up in my own kitchen such as BLT's, tuna salad sandwhich, tossed cobb, and burgers.\n\nAs the name infers, breakfast is big here.  And greasy and indulgent.  The \"five spot\" breakfast sandwhich appears to be the most popular item here and comes on a roll with two eggs, two slices of bacon, American cheese, and grilled onions.  (Personally, I feel American is the worst cheese in America, and I wish that government regulators would ban it from kitchen tables.) And when you add greasy grilled onions to an already greasy sandwhich with very un-American cheese, you get some bad bed-fellows.  So, unfortuantely, this breakfast for me was under-appreciated and finished by my breakfast date who had the same thing.\n\nOther breakfast items included omelets, salami scrambles, griddlecakes, and waffles.  Notable drink items were fresh squeezed orange juice, honey lemonade, or organic chocolate milk.\n\nVene Vidi Vici.  But I likely won't return.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had to wait for Matt's, I don't think I would like it so much. I mean, it's good, but it's not \"I will wait an hour in the Phoenix summer\" good.\n\nFortunately, I've live across the street from Matt's and discovered they have takeout! There is nothing better than walking out with my takeout while people who have been waiting for an hour enviously stare.\n\n\n\n\n\ni dont think they care that they are so rude. the worst service i have ever had. i was amazed that they would treat their customers like that.\n\n i will not spend any money there\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 480 reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast at this time. My guess is that I can't say anything that hasn't been said here or on Food Network. I have wanted to get here for a while, but finally made it in last week with \"second wife\". She and I are always up for sharing, so we got the cheese omelet with wheat bread and the griddlecakes. Wow.\n\nThe omelet was large and tasty; it went very well with the Tapatio that we both tried (for the first time!). We got the rosemary potatoes on the side and they were delish. The griddlecakes were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just perfect. Light and airy with a touch of sweetness.\n\nSaving the best for last... the toast. The bread was dark and amazing- full of seeds and whole grains. It came with a little butter, even though we asked for it dry. There was a small side of house-made blueberry preserves that were incredible. I would go back just for the toast and preserves!\n\nWe went on Friday at 1pm, probably a smart move.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was good.  Greasy but good.\n\nThe price of the small glass of fresh sqeezed orange juice was silly expensive but it was tasty.\n\nI had an omelet with sauteed mushrooms and onions and cheddar cheese with wheat toast and preserves as well as home fries.\n\nI would eat here again if there was no wait and I was in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking at a large hotel downtown I am always sending people to Mat's Big Breakfast and I finally had the opportunity to hear what all the talk was about this morning when a friend and I decided to eat there. As usual there was a wait, but there was some seating outside for us. I have to say I really liked the desert landscaping out front. I ordered the special which was an omelet with fresh jalapenos, cheese, with hash browns. I also ordered a side of the bacon which was delicious! Actually it was all delicious. All of the servers were extremely friendly and said goodbye and thank you to every patron that was leaving. The orange juice is also a must to try. It was like they picked an orange right off a tree. I can't wait to give my money to this place because it's local, the food is fresh, and it's just great.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn hour wait and well worth it. This breakfast will put you into the best food coma you've ever had before noon. When you wake up at 3 pm all you'll be thinking about is the amazing bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice that put you out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to describe Matt's is \"breakfast nirvana.\"  I've been going to this cheery downtown spot for weekend breakfasts and weekday lunches for around 2 years now and have never been disappointed with the food.  Small touches of quality abound: freshly-ground pork sausage patties, perfectly browned, homestyle potatoes o'brien (not of that cubed pre-frozen crap), thick-cut bread with homemade jam, and what tastes like real maple syrup for Matt's awesome pancakes.\n\nWhat keeps a breakfast enthusiast like me from hitting Matt's at each opportunity are the insane queues, especially on weekends.  The air conditioning can also be a bit sketchy at times, too, given the cramped space and swarm of humanity in there at busy times.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis morning's target was Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. After all of the media hype over this little original were they going to be as good as promised?\n\nWe were thrilled to find that Matt's is very close to the Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central, so we took the train and didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot. A very good thing as it turns out as there are a few parking lots near Matt's but all of them were full.\n\nI had heard that's Matt's was small, but I was not prepared for just how small. One car garage small. Including the kitchen! This causes a major problem for hungry customers, the wait was nearly two hours! Wow, this place must be great if people are willing to stand out in the rain for nearly two hours to get in.\n\nOnce we were inside and seated things actually moved pretty quickly. We actually had food inside of ten minutes of ordering. The only con inside I saw really was how loud it was. But hey, I could live with that.\n\nThe food was very good. My wife had the Chop and Chix, a lovely seasoned pork chop, eggs perfectly cooked, home style potatoes and toast. I had a Salami Scramble, three eggs, Molinari sopresseta, hash browns and toast. It was all very good, very flavorful.\n\nHowever, after the hype and the nearly 2 hour wait to get in I was expecting outstanding not just very good. The other reality check item for Matt's was the price. I ordered a soda, $2.75, what I received was a 12oz can of soda. Yup, nearly twice the price of a six-pack of soda at any store in town for one can. A 4oz glass of orange juice, granted freshly squeezed, was also nearly $3.00. Hmmm, I didn't order any. \n\nTotal bill for our breakfast was $27.00 plus tip.\n\nBottom line? Matt's Big Breakfast has very good food, but only very good food. There was nothing exceptional here to justify all of the hype, there are many other breakfast places here in town with food at least as good if not better than Matt's for less money and without the marathon wait to get in.\n\nIf you go to Matt's expect to wait at least an hour, you will enjoy the food I promise. Only you can decide if the wait and the price are worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a YELP guided breakfast stop on our Spring Training week food tour. I trust YELPers to guide me to the best places and they always come through. They were right on about the wait. Mid week around 9am and there was about a 30 minute wait with lots of people waiting outside the tiny little restaurant. Luckily we were just a 2 waiting for a seat, as opposed to the party of 9 who would have to be broken up or wait for hours to be seated.... (HINT HINT, not a place for groups. 2 is ideal. 3-4 is max unless you do not care about sitting together.)\n\nHaving been on day four of greasy high caloric breakfasts, I opted for the steel cut oatmeal with the raisins and brown sugar and an OJ. SG got standard egg plate with eggs, toast, ham and rosemary potatoes. SG was very happy when his plate arrived. The large piece of ham and the delicious rosemary potatoes set this place aside in his mind. My oatmeal was very good, but my humungous raisins put it over the top. The service was great and Matt himself was even there helping out. \n\nSG said this is how a breakfast place should be done and this is the model he would use for his own breakfast place (that will most likely never happen). The menu is limited, but offers the usuals. There is special attention paid to those things like the potatoes and the raisins that makes this place special. \n\nCheck it out. Expect a wait, bring a news paper.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo frills basic breakfast.  Hash browns were soggy and oily. Chop was cooked nearly perfect. Chop and chick, side of bacon, and glass of OJ came to $18 including tip, so it's a little pricy for a basic breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nGREAT food!  Small but intimate dining, just like the old days.  Have the pork chop and eggs or the eggs benedict....they're outstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best hashbrowns I have ever had. Cripsy, buttery, not soggy or soaking in grease. Cooked well done, can't wait to go back. I went for brunch around 10:30-11am and the wait is not as bad as earlier in the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's everything the more flattering reviews say and more - including the wait outdoors. Mine was during a rare Arizona downpour, but even so, it was well worth it.  I waited about half an hour, sharing an umbrella with strangers.  When it was time to be seated, I was asked \"are you ready, honey?\" by a woman who might have been half my age, if that.  Even though the place was cramped and extremely busy, all of the staff were friendly and accommodating.  Not long after being seated, I was poured the first of what turned out to be four cups of delicious, freshly-ground coffee, at which time my order was also taken.  I had the special - 3 scrambled eggs with locally-raised ham, roasted red peppers, and provolone cheese.  It arrived promptly, and was savored thoroughly.  I'm leaving Phoenix in less than 48 hours, but I'm definitely planning a return visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I were in the neighborhood as we had taken our daughter to check out PHX zoo. We heard about this place from diners, drive in and dives and had to check it out. \nwe were starving and had a wait for a full two hours prior to being seated! :( This place is a hole in the wall!! However, the breakfast was worth the wait! My wife had the bacon and waffle and enjoyed it so much that she ordered another order of the waffle. I had the special which was to die for, scrambled eggs with turkey sausage, peppers and cheese. \nwill definitely come back if we are nearby!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBest breakfast in Phoenix hands-down!\nLove, love, love the Chop and chick!  The pork chop is cooked perfectly.  First time ever I've had a pork chop cooked and seasoned perfectly that I didn't make myself :)\n\n\n\n\n\nsorry, everyone else---all the crybabies that want a big place to get a table fast, absoulutely comfortable refrigirated air, and room for your party of 38.  this is not your place, so deal with it.\n\nwhat it is, and the only way i found the place was doing some work about a couple blocks away, and wanted to get a good bite to eat.  nothing special, but something close.\n\nsomeone on our work crew steered me here.  i went back the second day as well.  the food is fresh, plentiful, and the service--at least to me was really attentinve.  i was lucky to hit the place where i did not have to wait.  \n\nplaces like this are the kind that i keep coming back to.  the quality of the food that i had was very very good, and the prices are reasonable as well.\n\nit's a cute place, but if you don't want cute, don't want to wait, and don't appreciate the kind of place that matt's it----go somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love breakfast food. Usually there are great options for non-meat eaters. But this is really a meat-eater's breakfast paradise. We realized during the long (1  1/2 hour) wait that we would have limited offerings, but everyone leaving assured us it was worth the wait and it was too late to get breakfast someplace else. \n\nMatt's served the hottest, best tasting scrambled eggs, amazing coffee and some pretty good pancakes.  My companion ordered the tuna sandwich. Good, but not worth the wait. Four stars for the food, minus the wait and the choices.\n\n\n\n\n\nwaited for a really long time . . . like an hour and a half.  To be honest - it wasn't all that and a bag of chips like I expected.  I mean, it was good, but I was expecting to get blown away and I didn't.  The breakfast wasn't even that big.  I had the special and I can't even remember what it was that's how unimpressed it was.\nI won't go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few places that I'm completely OK with waiting thirty to forty-five minutes to eat breakfast, much less in the Phoenix heat, but when it comes to Matt's Big Breakfast I don't think twice about it.  It's actually a regular occurrence, while sitting on the outdoor waiting benches, for the guests who are leaving to assure you it is worth the wait.\n\nThe place is small, you might even say cramped depending on where you are sat, but the food is second to none.  I always get the special, which varies from day to day.  It's typically a scrambler with generous helpings of meat and cheese, and some locally grown veggies or peppers.  I recommend a side of home fries with rosemary as opposed to the hash browns.  If you're not in the mood for eggs try the waffle or pancakes (seriously it's just all good), and if bread doesn't come with what you order you've got to try the sourdough toast with house made organic blueberry jelly...so delicious.\n\nIn addition to the amazing food, the service is always great.  Hands down, Matt's Big Breakfast is my favorite breakfast stop.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bacon served here is something special.  However, this place not only has big breakfasts it also has big waits.  The waits are to be expected with such an establishment, but once you reach your seat... well it is not a comfortable one.  The seating is too hard and the set-up does not support a leisurely weekend breakfast with friends...  a yummy breakfast... yes... but not a leisurely one.  Nevertheless, give it a try and enjoy the bacon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast does not get any better.  After eating the bacon at this restaurant, I can't order bacon at any other breakfast joints... it simply does not compare.  They use thick, smoked bacon that is incredible.  Definitely worth the extra dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was pretty good but the service was terrible. \n1. There was hair in one of our waffle plates. \n2. The servers were not very attentive. \n3. When we had a mistake on an order, the waitress rudely confronted us instead of being accommodating.\n 4. I had to wait over 5 minutes (after the rest of my party had walked out) just for them to notice I was waiting for the check. And last when I paid the bill they did not bother to ask how everything was. Poor service ruins even a great meal and I will NEVER return and let my friends know to not bother going there.\n\n\n\n\n\nI travel to Phoenix often and after several attempts to bypass long lines, I was able to get seated after a 20 minute wait. With that said, dishes with eggs and home fries were excellent. The chops were dry and not really flavorful. We sat at the counter and the service was efficient without feeling rushed. I liked this place, but the wait and the metered street parking doesn't make this a very convenient option for a weekday breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatts feels like home. The tables remind me of snack time in Grandma's kitchen, the salt and pepper shakers remind me of the ones that sat on my neighbor's counter in her collections.... even the slightly wobbly leg of the chair reminds me of my college apartment furnished with family castaways and thrift shop treasures. \n\nREAL food comes from a place that feels so much like home... by real, i mean... real eggs, real butter, real sausage.... \n\nFood at Matt's is pure and innocent... Pancakes with butter. Eggs with potatoes and bacon. Classic. \n\nyum.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am another who does not understand the hype about this diner. I have been there twice.  I have had the waffles and hash browns.   The waffles were soggy and the hash browns were very greasy (both times).  I could have done that at home without the 45 minute wait.  Plus, the coffee is putrid.\n\n\n\n\n\nCould be one of the best breakfast I have eaten outside of my kitchen.   The staff is friendly and the food came out fast and hot. I will be back in the near future.  Order the OJ is is fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\n*burp*\nYou know you have to put the guilt aside when it's lunch with your girlfriends.  More so when Dottsy suggested Matt's.  \nIt was my first time, I remember it like it was yesterday.  Or, a half hour ago.\nSign-in at the door to wait to be seated.  Gorgeous day out, so no big deal.  I took a seat on the bench outside and waited for Dottsy.  Then a lady sat at the other end of the bench and my side flipped up.  \nI had heard it was small...but not *this* small!  It was really cute and the staff was super-friendly.  I had to pee, though.  Apparently, the bathroom was off the kitchen.  OK.  I hope to myself as I make my way past the grills that I am not posing a health hazard to Matt's.  I mean, I was wearing a baseball cap, but no net!  Bathroom was tiny with no mirror.  That was ok for me, because, as I stated, it was baseball cap day.  The bathroom and its location are the only reason I took a star off.\nI got the cheddar and mushroom omelet.  Came with a side of hash browns and toast.  With a little cup of jelly.  At first, I didn't know it was jelly...until Dottsy saw a man put his little cup-o-stuff on his toast. \nOmelet was huge, as was the hash brown.  The omelet was stuffed.  STUFFED with cheese and mushrooms.  I could see the butter on the plate.  Oh, man, this was gonna ROCK!  The hash brown was made from spaghetti-cut potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmmmyummy!\nI ate it all.  Everything.  I mean, I waited a half hour to be seated.  And my 20-year High School reunion isn't until July.  So, that's ok that I cleaned off my plate.  Right?  RIGHT????\nOh, and I ran into Dallas there.  Always a plus!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food and service. I loved that they use all natural fresh ingredients from local farms. The place is small so get there early on the weekend if you want to avoid the wait and I don't think they have a bathroom so get that sorted before going. I was very happy with the overall experience and  I would  highly recommend a visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk. I started coming here when Matt could only get the local downtown area news channel to cover his place. It was only open for about 2 weeks and you could walk in at the height of the lunch hour and grab a table or spot at the bar. That was then and the food \"F\" rocked! Ok flashed forward to present day! Service is still pretty good, the wait can be a bit long, the food now is just ok. It has lost it's charm a little. Menu is sit short. If you are in the area and can afford to kill 30 minutes for a spot then check it out.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast? \n\nI'd say the only thing big about this place is the wait. When you walk up to the tiny place (it looks like a miniature brick block that you're not sure is big enough for humans), you scrawl your name down on a standard piece of notebook paper... and then you wait. Not fifteen minutes. Not twenty. More like 60. At least they have free water outside because, let's face, even in October, the Phoenix sun can be brutal.\n\nPeaking inside, you realize why there's such a wait: about 8 tables (most seat 2 or 4) and about 5 stools at the breakfast bar. It's no wonder... If you do the math, the average person takes about 30-45 minutes to eat breakfast. So, add the ordering time... the cooking time... the debit card time... And you have about an average of an hour per meal. The odds are against you.\n\nBut, you put your name down, so you might as well suck it up. It's going to be a BIG wait for Matt's Breakfast. So, it's no wonder the food gets such great reviews. You're ravenous by the time your name is called -- you'd eat the fake flowers if you could away with it. \n\nCoffee is meh. At least they bring ya real cream. That's awesome. \n\nThe decor is minimal. It's said the color orange makes one feel hungrier. I really don't think Matt needs to worry about his patrons being hungry by the time they sit down to eat. Again, the wait is BIG. \n\nBut, I'll stop whining about that. Moving on... \n\nI ordered the daily special - a scramble with mushrooms and fotini cheese. It came with home fries and two wedges of cinnamon raisin bread. It looked very good when it arrived. One bite of the scramble and I thought, \"I could have made this.\" The home fries were bland... nothing like Kerby Lane's in Austin, Texas (if you've ever been, you know what I'm talking about... please, somebody wipe the drool from my face...). The redeeming piece was the bread. Granted, it's not the best bread I've had, but it was pretty yummy. I made sure to finish all that off, but I left 1/2 my scramble and all but a couple bites of my home fries behind. \n\nAs for the service, is was above average. Not extraordinary, like I somehow expected from a place like this that boasts the cozy feel of eating among friends. The service was prompt, though, and the people working were friendly and seemed to be in a chipper mood -- that's hard to imagine when you've been on your feet since before 6 a.m. with a consistent rush. One of the cute waitresses even made people outside laugh with, \"We accept all kinds of payment. Cash. Credit. Check. Or you can work in the kitchen for a little bit.\" I thought her happy-go-lucky attitude was a breath of fresh air. \n\nIn conclusion... \n\nWalking away from the tiny place, I commented, \"I'm pretty sure I won't be going back there.\" \n\nFrom all the great reviews I've read, I had to try this place. I'm glad I did... it was definitely an experience, especially since the police showed up to deal with some next door squabble/drug bust/whoknowswhat. At least while I was waiting, I had free entertainment to occupy my time.\n\n\n\n\n\nService here is great.  Despite how busy it gets, the food came promptly and the wait was bearable (though 30-40 minutes on a Sunday morning can be hard for those running short on time!).  It's funny how you can smell bacon/greasy meat before you even walk in!  I eventually got accustomed to it.  I didn't get to try the waffles, but their hash browns were soo good!  I will definitely come back again if I'm in Phoenix again.\n\n\n\n\n\nNever before in my life have I tasted breakfast this good. The place is small (very small), expect to wait around an hour on the weekends.\n\nOnce you get in here try the \"Hog and Chick\", I suggest you get the hash browns over the potatoes, and you MUST MUST MUST try the bacon! (if you're a vegan - let it go for one day!) \n\nTheir waffles are to die for too.\n\nAnother 100 places like this and Downtown Phoenix will be THE place to live!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile my friend Austin was here in town, he had wanted to eat at Matt's big breakfast after hearing about it on a travel channel show.  So, we wandered downtown and tried this place for breakfast.\n\nWhen approaching the restaurant, we noticed that parking was limited.  Mostly sidestreet metered parking.  We found an open meter, and went inside.\n\nThe place is really cute from the outside, and crazy small on the inside.  Its more of a simple decor, with orange table tops, and white walls.  We had a small wait, and put our name on the list.\n\nEventually, we sat at the bar after waiting about 15 minutes in the sun. I ordered a cheese omelette, and Austin ordered a cheeseburger.  Both our food came out, and it was tasty!  Service was quick, and we were in and out of there in less then an hour.\n\nO, and a word of advice.  The bathroom here is located in the middle of the kitchen!  I had \"to go\" while we were waiting, and I was surprised at the whole thing.  the bathroom is teeny tiny, and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it.  Plus, its located immediately next to the grill!  If you can help it, either \"hold it\" or go before!  Fair warning for bathroom users!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I'm heading out to California and I decide to \"load up\" before I hit the road. I've been wanting to try Matt's ever since I moved here last year. So, I get up early to try to get a head start on traffic and lo and behold, traffic. I finally get there after a few wrong turns (Thanks stupid GPS, you're going back from whence you came). I sidle up to the bar and now the decicsion begins. Eggs? Omelette? Cakes? Cakes it is and a side of bacon. While I wait with my cup of coffee, which wasn't half bad, I take in the smallness of this place. Glad I got there early. The GriddleCakes arrive with the bacon. The sweet cream they use makes other places cakes seem like toast. Rich and fluffy with the melting butter on top and real maple syrup, Wooo! The bacon was nice. Cooked to where it wasn't too crispy or too rubbery. And with pepper. Now I just hope I don't fall asleep during my drive. Oh, and what's with the metered parking. I put my .60 in the meter which should have given me an hour and I go out to my car 45 minute later and the meter says expired. What?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat hasn't been said about Matt's???  It's great food and the folks that work there are as friendly as they can be.  Get there early or you'll wait.  Every time I bring the two year old with me the staff goes out their way to take care of this Daddy on a date with his daughter.  Hog and Chick is the staple and the hash brown taste like they've been cooked in a pound of butter.  Be still my beating heart... Eat any more and we'll see that.  The Missus had the pancakes and they were also great.  Fresh ingredients abound and you syrup isn't flavored corn syrup.  Real maple syrup!!!  A true Phoenix landmark and place to eat\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd have to say it was a decent breakfast... nothing more, nothing less.  I had a cheddar cheese and ham omelet with hashbrowns, sourdough toast and mediocre coffee.  The hashbrowns were on the greasy side, but that didn't bother me; it's just that nothing blew me away either.  The service was a bit slow considering we got there at about 6:50 a.m. and there were open tables; so I can only imagine how it would be at any other time of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was good but the 45 minute wait ruined my experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery good traditional breakfast spot. I stopped in just as they opened during the week to make sure and grab a spot.  I was treated with a really tasty plate of eggs and peppered bacon.  One of the biggest pluses, Matt's actually knows how to cook hash browns, I didn't need to order them well done, they come nice and crispy as is.  The real show stealer is the toast and home made jam.  Nicely done breakfast at Matt's, go grab some!\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel kinda silly writing about a place that already has over 200+ amazing reviews, but this is the internet and goddamnit, my opinion matters. But its true.. All 200+ rave reviews are spot on... \n\nMatts. Is. The. Shit. \n\nIf it weren't for the long-ass wait in the three thousand degree AZ summer heat, I'd probably be there on a regular, but sorry dudes, I am a ginger kid, and I burn. I also have no soul, but you all already knew that.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI was skeptical for, ohhh, about a year... yes, it took me that long to actually muster up the patience to deal with the wait.. but I have very persuasive friends who have really good ideas., so last Saturday, I went, and the fact that its been almost a week since i've tasted the sweet spuds in their hashbrowns makes me want to cry. They are seriously, one of the most delicious things ive ever eaten. I got the Chop & Chick.. because i love pigs and eating them. The pork was perfect, nicely seasoned, tender and delicious. I got my eggs over medium, because egg yolk is one of my favorite things to dip shit in, and an order of home fries because the waitress said the hash browns were \"kinda funky, not like usual\", that day.. but she lied. or maybe she didn't, but my friend got them and either way, they were amazing. My friends got the 5 spot (breakfast sandwich thing) & the daily special (some chorizo mexicany mash up of yum), which were both equally amazing, but for real, my yolk covered pork chop superseded anything those fools were eating. Its been on my mind for days.\n\nAs usual, I drank way too much coffee, but what I should have done was order a chocolate milk like my good friend Georgie S. had.. For whatever reason, it was better than any other chocolate milk in the universe.\n\nIts small, cramped, kinda retro, no booze and there is no bathroom.. but whatever, I like places like this. its totally worth it, and did I mention its CHEAP?!\n\nGo here at least once in your life. Make sure to get the HB's and visit The Downtown Phoenix Farmers Market across the street when you're finished. Its the perfect way to start your Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great place - small funky and right on time. I love this place - its old school charm with your mama's kind of cooking - huge portions, excellent food - sloppy joes - no way - WAY!  Not fancy - but I love the tight quaint atmosphere - reminds me of a neighbor joint in Chicago. Try it - you'll lie it! Historic area of the Phoenix Downtown area. Very reasonable - and REAL food!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I say that hasn't been said about this place, other than the fact that my dad was visiting from Mexico and found this place as he strolled through Downtown back when this place first opened and recommended it to me. \nHigh wait times are WORTH THE WAIT. Even the water with lemon they have outside for you while you wait is delicious and satisfying. I always go for the special, and my oh my it has never disappointed.\nYou can tell the difference between this place and other breakfast joint once you taste their food, its natural, organic, with lots of flavor and it smells fresh. \nTheir rosemary garlic potatoes are the best, their pancakes are a trip to Neverland, and their coffee is just as good as the one at a Starbucks. \nThis place has a special place in my heart because I remember going to it when the hype hadnt started and I hardly to wait to eat there at first, so I am glad for them because they really deserve all of the attention that they get for their delicious food. Plus, the owners wife always remembers me and even tells me she hasnt seen me in a long time when I go, its just a wonderful place that knows how to treat its customers and how to keep em happy.\n\n\n\n\n\ni can never remember if i like the hash browns or home fries. it's the home fries, definitely. portions are super huge. i don't go here nearly enough, but maybe that's a good thing. breakfast is too delicious for words.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hearing so many positives about Matts Big Breakfast, I decided after retrieving my friend from the airport to go and get my breakfast on! Love at first sight , no!! But never judge a book by it's cover, right? Huh, maybe... Parking is minimal, and in that part of the city.. It can be dicey to find parking . The place is tiny.. Tinier & more cramped with dreadful decor... Much like Over Easy, in fact! There are a handful of basic breakfast selections.. With catchy names though.. I ordered the 'hog & chick' for example.. Only bc I wanted to have poached eggs.. That was     just the easiest way to get them& I passed my 'hog' on to my hungry hog\n\nloving friend... The eggs are free range &  were perfectly poached, score ! Finally some chef in the desert got my poach correct... I'm very picky on the poach... Not like it's a hard process, I know as I have the calphelon pan for poaching in my own loft! I loved my home fries.. Big nice wedges of potatoes.. Sidenote -- too many Rosemary stems.. For me and my built in retainer , it could become a toothy disaster ! And whoa with the onions... Yikes ! Great for flavor, but not unless your planning on being amongst the masses following breakfast! There were a ton of big slivers of white onion.. But once your past picking all the flavor adding things out,you have great home fries..my friend has the hashbrowns, she said they reminded her of OreIda with alot of grease...I've never been a fan of shredded potatoes seemingly devised to soak up oil from the pan , so I wouldn't test them... Loved the bread... Wow! Homemade jams too.. Yum! There was no fruit on the plate.. It's presented in a basic diner way.. I personally like some fruit when I go down the breakfast path.. Relatively inexpensive.. Coffee , nothing special & no options for espresso ... Thot I was going to have a small panic attack over that alone... One other disappointment... Restroom?? No.. It's next door in a divey looking motel with wooden shutters ... I'll wait & use the Starbucks restroom as I drive home disappointed and needing espresso fast.. I'm thinking I'm seriously picky with my breakfast/brunch & just unable to find a 4star option here.. Oh well, I fly for free... I'm goin back to Cali..\n\n\n\n\n\nIts been a while since the hubs and I had been to Matt's. \n\nWe woke up on New Years Eve and I knew Matt's had to be our last breakfast of the year. \n\nWe got there at about 930 and were 5th in line! Wooooot! \n\nThe hubs and I grabbed a spot on one of the benches and had fun watching all the newbs come up. They always walk right past all the people standing outside waiting, past the sign in page and march inside like they own the place. soooo funny. \n\nThe food and service is still as great as its ever been! The waffle was sent from heaven and so was the bacon! \n\nEven though our visits have become few and far between due to moving further away, Ernie still knows who we are and keeps teasing us and asking when we are going to have kids, she is like a distant aunt! Love her! \n\nKeep it up Matts!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was so very excited to eat here as I had been trying for a number of years.  The wait was not bad and we were seated within 30 minutes on a Thursday morning.\n\nEveryone was polite and this being a very tiny spot everything was quick.\nI ordered the waffle and bacon and my mom had the ham and cheese omelet. WOW is all I can say we were both impressed and I really enjoyed the waffle and the thick sliced bacon.\n\nI really really enjoyed the thick sliced bread with the strawberry preserves and the omelet was amazing. Also the chocolate milk was very very good.\n\nIf your in phoenix I cant say enough that you should try Matt 's for friendly service and great food. It is worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, yes.  This place is awesome.  The other reviewers are right and have covered the details.  In order to not waste your time, I'll keep it short and simple.\n\n - Best pancakes I've ever had.\n - Bacon was quite delicious.\n - Spectacular, thick cuts of bread for the toast.\n - Yummy, homemade jam.\n - Quick and friendly service.\n - Don't forget to ask for your to-go cup of coffee.\n\nI went on a Friday morning, and we only waited 5 minutes for a table of four.  Like \"they\" say, this place is small so it's going to fill up quick on the weekends.  Not sure about you, but I instantly think, \"What can I do to avoid the wait?\"\n\nHere's my tip . . . find a reason to go out to breakfast on a weekday.  Plan a \"business breakfast\" with some co-workers (we do \"business lunch\" all the time . . . why not breakfast?).  Or pick a day when you can go in an hour or two late and have a friend meet you.  Make it a birthday breakfast for your signification other, parent, or sibling.  Whatever the reason . . . just find one!  It's a nice way to mix up the regular weekly routine with something fun and treat yourself at the same time.  \n\nAnd trust me, Matt's is worth it!\n\n\n\n\n\nI never thought I would say this, but I recently had a breakfast better than one consumed at Matt's.  It's best not to go any further.  That being said, whenever I am off on a weekday, the urge to go to Matt's emerges at the crack of dawn and does not subsist until I have either satiated myself with hash browns at their tiny digs or have painfully decided to deny myself the rich excess.\n\nThe wait is almost always 45 minutes even if you are a party of 1.  Going later helps reduce the wait.  Sometimes.  The wait though only builds the appetite and anticipation.  This is food that deserves such dedication.\n\nI almost exclusively get the special.  And they are all special.  However, the most special of all specials was my first and one that I hope will make a comeback soon.  Imagine for yourself: Chicken Artichoke Sausage, Fresh Mozzarella, Organic Spinach (locally grown, mind you), Hash Browns, and Whole Wheat Toast (with some local fruit preserves that they like to give a lot of props to when they deliver it to you).\n\nAlso, cheers to the wait staff who work frantically in such a small space.  I also appreciate their sort of Mother Hubbard, pseduo-indie, partially jeans and a t-shirt dress code.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's was my favorite breakfast place ever but now I have to add a caveat.  Do not go to Matt's during a busy if you want to hear anything the waitress or anyone that is with you.  The food is still fabulous and it is great that you do not need to wait long but the noise level is a constant roar of voices.  Even if I was alone it is uncomfortably noisy.  I would not go there again for breakfast until at least after 9 AM .  Maybe it gets busy again for the lunch crowd but I have never been there  after 10:30AM\n\n\n\n\n\nI was over to Matt's again last week. I finally had a chance to try lunch here. OMG! This place should be called Matt's bad ass Butter Burger! Are you kidding me it is so amazingly delicious! I have been lucky I guess and have not had to wait to get into Matt's. But I would wait for one of these burgers any day! Katie food was OK are you nuts! First Watch can't even be compared to Matt's menu. UGH gimme a break!\n\nMatt's ButterBurger is so freakin good I don't have words to describe the deliciousness of it all.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo until today I didn't know there was a lot of hype about this place.  Ashley L. suggested it and I said sure why not.  While waiting for her in the parking lot, doors locked and windows up, I decided to look at it on Yelp.  Wow was there a lot of reviews.  \nSo we got there early and there was no wait.  I guess that is rare.  We both got The Hog and Chick with bacon and sourdough bread she got eggs over hard and I got them scrambled and we shared a stack of pancakes.  I have to admit that the food was really good.  I am not saying this because others have said it but because it is my own opinion.  Like I said I didn't even know it existed until she suggested it.  The service was great and we had a great experience. \nMy only problem is the size.  It is tiny.  Wow.  There is a place on the west side known as The Place and it used to be in a small location and moved to a larger one.  Much easier to get in and the food is still great.  They may stay there because it feels quaint but that I think was the only flaw I saw.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we were on vacation and Guy Fiere had suggested a breakfast place my wife agreed to go to Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. This place may have converted my wife to becoming a breakfast liker.\n\nThough there menu below is kinda of lite on options. Nine breakfast items and if your there after 11am you can choose from another nine lunch items. If it wasn't for Guy Fiere featuring them on them twice on the Food Network we would have skipped this place. How could any of these common breakfast items be so good to wait in line for about forty-five minutes.\n\nOverall the restaurant can hold maybe about fifty people. I wouldn't suggest this place if you had a party of more then four. They really don't have room to combine a whole lot of tables. Also they don't quote wait times be scared, be very scared or bring a newspaper or your phone with a 2 person game like we did. We like playing Connect 4 it's an easy game but both of us are pretty competitive, so time passes fast. \n\nWe got seated at the bar, the service was prompt. We ordered coffee's, Griddle Cakes and The Chop and Chicks. Took under fifteen minutes to get our food out. The food was hot and smelled amazing.\n\nAccording to my wife these are the best pancakes the ever! She almost couldn't put the fork down. They were really light, sweet and fluffy pancakes. It was served with a nice dollop of butter and warm maple syrup.\n\n\n\n\n\nI waited for 2-3 hours awhile back because everyone was raving about this place.. I had the pork chop but it wasn't anything special. Maybe I was just tired from waiting so long. I didn't get what was so special about the place. But I will try it again and maybe find the magic in it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter driving from Lake Havasu to Phoenix, the bf and I were ravenous and wanted something big and breakfast-y.  Matt's Big Breakfast was the natural choice, and we didn't regret it, not one bit!\n\nWe arrived at 2pm, and the place closes at 2:30, according to the sign on the door.  Luckily, they let us eat.  I got the waffle and eggs ($6).  The waffle was possibly the best I'd ever had - big squares of Belgian waffle fluffiness.  The eggs, scrambled, were organic, and they made sure we knew it.  I appreciated this very much because I live in organic capital of the world.  Also on the side was a delicious, fresh thick-cut of bacon, perfectly peppered.\n\nThe bf had the salami scramble ($6.50), equally delicious, with authentic, not-out-of-the-bag salami.  These were thick chunks, and tasted wonderful in the softly scrambled eggs.\n\nIf I'm ever in this neck of the woods again, I'll be sure to stop by Matt's. Overall, a delicious breakfast experience for a steal!\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall cozy joint.... great coffee... friendly servers....simple menu. \nAnother Triple D find worth going to...... I am finding Guy F. loves Arizona... after spending a week here I can see why.. tons of good eats super little time! Got here after the business people but before the slacker crowd (back home that means somewhere between 8:30 and 9 AM). So we had no wait....\n\nI got the five spot which totally kept me full for hours...that and the three cups of local coffee... The peppery bacon this joint uses is to die for...My five spot: The sweet onions, the bun, the bacon and the perfectly cooked eggs.... solid breakfast. I had a taste of Julie K's griddlecakes and they were yummy. \n\nI appreciate simplicity and this place has some basics on the menu but do them well. Reasonably priced menu... I highly recommend :-).\n\nFew things\n1. BRING QUARTERS ....  lots of places to park but it is metered parking\n2. come early and make sure EVERYONE in your party is there\n3. Bathroom is next door (TALK TO MIKEY.. he is a very wise and amazing person)\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat specials, decent service. Definitely a local hotspot. Board was not current.\n\n\n\n\n\nDunno if you can really call it a big breakfast, but it's usually a good breakfast.\nSeems like it's a scratch cooked kitchen because the food seems so fresh and tasty.\n\nWe liked the salami scramble with the fresh baked wheat toast,, it works well.\n\nSweet as sugar, attractive waitresses who are appreciative of their customers and seem to be right there for ya. They always remember you.\n\nBeware that you are charged for all drink re-fills except coffee, and they may not mention it to you,, and suddenly your bill doubles.\n\nYeah,,, you have a wait, even for the 5 seat counter,, and sometimes they'll seat an employees family member way ahead of you,, and sometimes forget to check the sign-in list and customers are left stranded outside and ignored,, that really sucks.\n\nIf ya feel un-loved outside sitting on the on deck bench, perhaps peek inside and remind them someones waiting.\n\nBring quarters for the parking meters. A buck fifty an hour.\n\nCramped and uncomfortable seating throughout. No place for a fat man,, non-fat only.\n\nOpens at 6:30 AM and they usually call it a day roughly around 2:30 PM.\nClosed Mondays last we rolled through.\n\nI like almost everything on the menu, though it seems when a good food place gets national media attention, their quality thus backs into hell. \n\nWe'll see with Matts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's about time that people be a lot more honest in their reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast.\nThis place is over hyped in every sense, and mainly - still - because of its faux-trendy/hip atmosphere...  that was cute five or so years back.\nThough, what matters is the food and maybe the surroundings of a place, right?\n\nWell, the servings are hearty (pack an extra artery), and the home fried potatoes are tasty.\n\nThat's about it.\nEnd of review.\n\nNo... got to be a little more honest here.\n\nThe rest of the menu is mediocre at best, and hardly worth an hours' wait in line and/or just to be seated, nor enough to chew on or pay for.  The first or second time might be cool, you may enjoy it.  But the third time there you'll be honest to admit that there's far better elsewhere.\nAs surroundings go, the place is like a muggy gym locker room but smaller in size, and so poorly ventilated that you'll think that the proprietor's must think nothing of sitting in the humidity upon a toilet of a rest stop in Austin, TX with their plate of food on their knees.\nMe thinks that anyone with a few simple squares of aluminum foil and heat could cook any of Matt's menu items within their own kitchen and very likely do better within 20 minutes flat, easy.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh or scathing, but after hearing so many sheep over hyping this place time after time you realize it's all fake kissy-kiss talk.  \"Phooey!\", I say.\n\nThe most important thing you must know and take from this - regardless of whether anything I'm saying here is something you agree with or not - is to beware of the... ehm... \"coffee\".  Sincerely.  I've heard many others state that you must be an incredibly gracious customer to take a sip.  Merely a whiff of its bouquet brings to mind a vinaigrette of acrid rags and dank wool socks.  Most folks count on having a great cup of coffee with their breakfast; a great cup of coffee is obviously required in conjunction with breakfast.  Like the necessary combinations of two things: Sun & Moon, peanut butter & honey, soap & water, doesn't everyone have a knowing that if you're going to serve coffee during breakfast it needs to taste like coffee?  Even if it's the most watered down brew it needs to taste something LIKE coffee.  Apparently Matt's will hear none of that; they don't seem to be aware nor have heard the talk that some folks don't return just because their coffee resembles what Grandpappy brewed up in a drop-pan a week ago ON TOP OF the coffee grounds that he brewed a month ago, then filtered through newspaper taken from the doghouse outside and used a second time to line the bottom of a bird cage.  (Shwew!)  In fact, I can count two separate occasions when I had actually overheard a server apologize to customers who'd commented on their putrid brew.  Utterly disgusting.\n\nThe servers and cooks are nice, friendly and personable (I'm talking - genuinely enjoy what they do) and that, admittedly, counts for a whole lot.\nNonetheless, give Matt's a try at least once.\nAt least.\nBut, pass on the coffee... or, \"Don't go into the light!\" as they say of near death experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went early, 8am on a Sunday for breakfast.  There was a 5 minute wait (although they don't quote wait times), and we sat at the bar counter.  The coffee was delicious, as was the daily lemonade.  We ordered an egg special with country sausage patties, homefries, and toast.  My husband is a huge sausage fan, and he thought it was very good.  The bacon was delish, and the pancakes were simply but fluffy and flavorful.  We will be back, but we will go early because by the time we left, there was a very lengthy wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Bacon - taste beautiful \n- potatoes - good\n- Waffles tasted homemade\n- Toast - jelly taste homeade\n\nCons\n\n- the wait time.\n- the butter burger could've been better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been to Matt's a couple of times now.  There is always a line.  Most recently I went on a Wednesday, which they will tell you is the slowest day,  and the line was shorter that day.\n\nMatt's is small, not in a quaint way, but in a cramped way.  I sat at the counter.  It's impossible to sit comfortably at their counter, because of the lack of leg room, but the other problem is that  they have put one too many chairs at the counter, so I was bumping elbows throughout my meal with my neighbors.  If you go by yourself, they won't let you sit at a table, so you're stuck at their crappy counter.  (don't get me wrong...I normally love to sit at the counter at a restaurant, as you get better and faster service)\n\nOne of my meals, the AZ scramble (a special) was pretty solid.  And I like the rosemary homefries.  Other meals (including the salami and eggs) weren't that remarkable.\n\nMatt's won't be my first, second, third choice for breakfast in the valley.  Too much trouble for inconsistent results.  If I want to wait in a line I'll go to Morning Glory Cafe, where the atmosphere is SO much better and the food is better.  If I don't want to wait in a line, there are many other breakfast places that offer good consistent food without a wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was great. Eggs were perfect, delicious pancakes. Very nice servers. Not worth the wait in the summer months. We sat/stood in 90 degree weather for 45 min with minimal shade and seating. No waiting room inside. I'd go again when it cools off\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, but not worth a significant wait.  The food is good, but anyone from the Midwest (like me) will probably find it to be similar to the average diner back home.\n\nI cannot figure out what the hype is for this place, other than perhaps the fact that this place stands out in a city that really doesn't have too much else to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been to Matt's Big Breakfast twice. I was not impressed by the long wait or the atmosphere. It  was small and dingy. The bathroom in the dive hotel next door was really disgusting.\n\nI did enjoy the food though. The first time I got an *egg white and vegetable omelet*, which was ok. It was fresh, which was good. The real stand out for me was the *toast*, they said they said it was local and the bakery sold at the farmers market around the corner. It was really delicious. I also enjoyed the *hashbrowns*, they were greasy but yummy. They used a spice that I couldn't discern. I think it was a little bit of nutmeg. It really popped. \n\nThe second time we went, I got the *egg salad sandwich*. It was well balanced. Same good bread. I got a side of hashbrowns, because I enjoyed them the first time. \n\nMy husband wasn't impressed at all. He thought his omelet was average and didn't really care for the atmosphere.\n\nBecause of the cost, and atmosphere, I don't think we will be returning anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the best breakfast I've ever had.  Period.  The food was SO good that it totally outweighed the wait outside on a hot day.\n\nYes, you WILL wait if you come here, but it is absolutely worth it.  The staff here are quite adept at quickly moving people through the restaurant without making anyone feel terribly rushed, and other than your wait to get seated, you won't wait long on anything else.\n\nMost breakfast places excel at one or two things, usually the sweeter side of breakfast (pancakes, waffles, etc).  I don't tend to eat a lot of these, so I'm stuck getting some half-toasted toast, eggs, and potatoes.\n\nNot here.  Here everything on their menu looks good and is even better in execution.\n\nI did end up ordering the toast, eggs, and potatoes, to be fair, but I still can't forget just how good they were.  The toast was a whole-grain variety, thickly sliced, nutty, and perfectly toasted.  It was served with butter and jam, and it was so good that I was reluctant to let my friend try any of it.  The potatoes were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, but both the toast and the potatoes paled in comparison to the eggs.\n\nYes.  Eggs.  Matt's Big Breakfast earns my nod as the best breakfast joint I've ever patronized because of their eggs.  They were scrambled, but something about them was so mouthwatering that I was disappointed when I finished them.   Most scrambled eggs at other restaurants are served cold, dry, chewy, or any number of other unappetizing ways.  Not at Matt's.  I'm sure they cooked them in butter or something equally as awful for you but, damn, were they ever good.  To this day, nearly a year later, I still have not had better eggs anywhere else.  Believe me, I've tried.  Nothing beats Matt's.\n\nEverything else looked amazing, and they frequently feature specials.\n\nThis is the Pizzeria Bianco of breakfast in Phoenix.  Long waits, but a must-attend for each and every Phoenician.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place. We've been going every Saturday for the past few months, and although there is always at least an hour wait on Saturdays the awesome food and cute cozy atmosphere has been worth it. This is definitely a gem in the heart of downtown Phoenix, I personally love the Hog and Chick which is two eggs cooked to order, three big strips of peppered bacon, your choice of hash browns or home fries and your choice of fresh baked toasted bread on the side served up with preserves from a local source. Their honey lemonade is inspired and their iced coffee is pretty good too. \n\nThey are right across the street from the Phoenix Public Market and if you want to go walk around and see the shops instead of waiting outside (for an hour) you can write 'market' by your name and you will be seated next up if you get back after you've been called. My daughter always orders the waffles and devours them and her dad keeps 'waffling' between the pancakes and the waffles but always cleans his plate (and usually some of mine as well!) the hostess is very cheery and efficient, she calls us 'Team Justin' and she always checks in with us at least once or twice during our meal.\n\nI'd definitely check this place out if you've never been, they used to be closed on Monday's but very recently that's changed and I've been told that if you want to get in WITHOUT the wait, Monday is the time to go! Happy Eating from Team Justin!\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Matt?\nWhy is his breakfast so big?\nWhy are there lines out the door on a regular basis?\nWhy am I able to without hesitation give this place full marks?\n\nI took Kristy to this place one cold Fiesta Bowl morning when Jonny decided he needed to sleep in rather than entertain his guests!  Somehow, I remembered that I needed to arrive around 8am if I would get a seat and parking and not starve at the door.  We walked right in!\n\nThis intimate kitchen setting stashed in the middle of downtown nowhere really is the BIG attraction in the area.  Wholesomely good with organic everything and home grown and home made this and that, I found myself ooohing and aaaahing before even opening my mouth to sample the tea and grapefruit juice!  EVERYONE's food seem to lure me in and I actually had a VERY hard time selecting just one item that I wanted for breakfast.\n\nThe menu is not big. But my eyes were as a re-contemplated the implications of not getting one item or selecting another option over another.  I landed somehow on the omelette!  Original n'est pas?\nI enjoyed everything about it.  Kristy got the pancakes and coffee and is still talking about how this was the next best thing to do if  you were denied a promised road trip by a hungover friend to Sedona!\n\n\n\n\n\nbesides the wait, being i am not a patient person all i can say its worth the wait  .this is my first visit the breakfast was simple but delicous bacon excellent great hash browns and thick baked bread slices and well priced oh and fab staff\n\n\n\n\n\nFor any of you that have been to Matt's and don't like it, no offense, but we wouldn't make a good breakfast eating team. \n\nBecause I love it. I had read and heard many a glowing review of this place from friends but the lingering question in the back of my mind was \"How can bacon, toast, and eggs be that good?\" Candidly, I still don't know the answer to that question. What I do know, however, is that it is, indeed, that good, if not better than I ever dreamed simple breakfast foods could be. \n\nThe line can be a formidable obstacle. There is a pad on top of the water by the front door where people write in the name of their party and number of people and you just wait for them to call your name into the tiny restaurant. I saw quite a few people outside, content to be waiting with a book, obviously knowing what they had in store.\n\nAs for the \"too much butter\" complaint from other reviewers, my advice is don't worry about it. If you want a light breakfast, Matt's isn't what you're looking for. For an obscenely delicious plate exploding with flavor and goodness, bring a book and post up at Matt's. It's worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the menu looks small and simple, but this place is really good!  I went for breakfast. We both had eggs.  My eggs were eggs. But, the eggs with salami were really yummy and salty. The hash browns and home fires were awesome! Some of the best I'd ever had.  The toast was delicious and came with (I think homemade) blackberry preserves. So good!  And my coffee and water glass was never empty.  \n\nWe went on a weekday at 7:30 and there was no wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove their cheeseburger, can tell it's real meat no 90% fillers! Hotcakes, real maple syrup and best bacon ever! Do expect about 1 to 1hr1/2 wait but totally worth it!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was on the DD&D places my family wanted to go while in town, I joined them since I'd heard plenty about it but never gone.\n\nThe place is small, so yes there is going to be a wait.  You chose to eat there knowing this so complaining about the wait is pretty ridiculous.  That said, I'm not sure if I'd attempt coming here on a weekend, but during the workweek it was fine, the wait was maybe 20-30 minutes.\n\nThe food was great, the coffee was strong.  My only complaint is with more than one person checking on our table we asked for water from them 2-3 times and I don't think they ever came back with it.  Wasn't that big of a deal but seemed like it wasn't that hard since they were checking on us about every 2 minutes (got the feeling of being rushed through our meal, but maybe that is their way of keeping the flow of folks coming in and out).\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm  going to stop being such a taker, and give for once! I use Yelp along with other reputable websites to help make my dining, travel and shopping decisions and I never take the time to give back!! I know, I know....awful. I'm turning over a new leaf! Here is my first Yelp. Please don't judge. It's my first time.... Okay, here goes. So, I went to Matt's for the first time a few days ago....\n\nFood- Amazing.  Best pancakes ever! I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.\n\nThe building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile in Phoenix, walked to Matt's for breakfast on Saturday morning. Not being really familar with it, I had no expectations. We ended up having to wait over an hour to be seated - mostly because this place is really freaking small. (If you have a big group, you'll take up the entire restaurant and that's just rude.) The menu is pretty sparse, but has something for everyone. I got the hog and chick - with scrambled eggs (just ok), thick cut bacon (it was heavy on the pepper but good), hash browns (odd, the home fries looked better) and sourdough toast (next time, I'm just getting the toast. The sourdough was awesome). With a coffee, I think my total was around $10-11 - not too bad. \n\nOverall, if it was a random day during the week with no wait, I'd be more excited. I'm not sure it was worth the wait - but my cousin is still talking about how great it was.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisappointing.  I have been hearing about this restaurant for YEARS and was really disappointed.  While the quality of the food was exceptional, the dining experience was marginal.  Difficult to hear, too much traffic, too small of a location.  Clearly, this is an acquired taste by a loyal group of patrons.  Glad they use cage-free eggs!\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't been here in a while.  Stopped in Monday AM and didn't have to wait for a table which is rare.  I had their special which was scrambled eggs with apple sausage and spinach.  Served with hash browns and toast it was a great way to start the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast is the real deal - celebrating tons of local ingredients and making everything from scratch. But the wait can be killer.\n\nWe were a party of three going to Matt's about noon on a Sunday. I had heard about the wait, but the hour we sat there was still pretty rough. Once we were seated, though, the service was fast and friendly.\n\nOur friend (who's a local) told us the best thing on the menu was The Hog & Chick, so that's what all of us ordered. I was totally pleased with everything:\n\n* Coffee - from a local roaster\n* OJ - freshly squeezed (in a teeny tiny glass)\n* Eggs - fresh and local\n* Potatoes - buttery, herbed, and delicious\n* Toast - thick, buttery, and delicious\n* Preserves - homemade at Matt's and super delish\n* ham - a giant slab of serious goodness\n\nThe price was very reasonable too - especially for the quality of food. For all the items listed above, I paid about $15. Next time I'm in the area, I'll totally go back to Matt's, but I'll try to pick an obscure time when the wait isn't quite so bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nGRANDMA !!!!!! ARE YOU BACK IN THAT KITCHEN?? GET OUT OF THERE!!! \n\nThat's basically how I always describe this place.. \"Its grandma breakfast\"... you know fresh, cooked to order, and way too much! \n\nI have always loved Matts and have been coming for many years...the only thing I hate.. the wait.. (well, that and the unfinished, sloppy paint job in the dining room) \n\nThe food is ALWAYS great here... their pork products are amazing! Super fresh cage-fee chicken eggs, local produce and hearty THICKLY sliced breads served with a side of strawberry lavender preserves... yummy. If you're not in a hurry and have the time to endure the wait... this place is HIGHLY recommended! \n\nAlthough my grandma left me many years ago... her breakfast spirit lives here!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I were visting Phoenix this past week. We looked on Yelp for a recommendation for a great breakfast place that wasn't far from our hotel downtown. \n\nBoy were we happy we found Matts! It was Thursday morning and the wait was only about 10 minutes. The restaurant is small and lively. The service was fast and friendly. And the food was FANTASTIC!\n\n I got the H & C - with delicious thick cut peppered bacon and fluffy scrambled eggs. The hashbrowns were delicous and the thick slices of sourdough toast with raspberry preserves completed the meal. The coffee was also very good. My husband had the salami scramble and thought it was very tasty as well. \n\nMatt's was one of the highlights of our week!\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't be turned off by the location and size. Good things come in small packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been hearing rave reviews about this place from all my co-workers, so I decided to give it a go.\n\nI called to place an order and the girl accidentally hung up on me. I don't know why that bothers me so much, maybe it's just because you should know how to operate your phone?\n\nWhen I went to pick up my order the place is busy, as always which is a great thing. It's like going to a Mexican restaurant and seeing Mexicans, it just means the food is good. \n\nI got the omelet with onions and ham, with hash browns and wheat toast. The top half of the hash browns were on point, crisp and tasty. The bottom half . . . soggy and soaked in grease. GROSS. \n\nThe omelet was huge! If you are looking for a lot of food this is the place to go, though if you are looking for taste I would skip the omelet. The only thing that didn't taste like cardboard was the ham. Thank God for the ham. \n\nThe wheat toast was ok, though the spread they include has chunks of fruit in it and is amazing.\n\nDon't order the OJ to go. You get about 3oz. of it in a plastic sippy cup. I don't know if they thought I was heading to the airport? \n\nAnyway, if you want a huge obese enticing portion go here you will get it. If you are looking for a non soggy breakfast I would keep looking.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage at best.  I have been here 3 times, primarily based on all the hype and wanting to be sure that I was giving Matt's a fair shake.  Listen, it's not terrible...but it's just nothing special at all.  The menu is basic and unimaginative.  I guess I would expect some creativity in the menu selections for such a \"hot spot,\" but alas there is none.  The execution is ok, but not great.  I thought the hash browns were terrible (greasy and overdone) and the rest of it was quite ordinary, if not excessively greasy.  It's small and crowded.  The service was generally fine.  I also thought it was a bit overpriced...particularly the OJ, which I think was like $4 for a tiny glass of what seemed to be made-from-concentrate OJ.  Anyway, I think I'm done with this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nHmmmmm, another place I heard about for years. Movie stars love it! Locals love it! Food critics love it! I am not a breakfast food eater for breakfast so I figured I would never try it. Hey, I am OK with Denny's or McDonalds for Breakfast! I knew I had to go when the gentleman sitting next to me on the plane recently told me that he purposely landed a layover in Phx just to try the darn place. ( I am like,\" Really\"? But then I thought I might do the same over a great NY pizza sooooooooo I cut the guy some slack-lol) So when I found myself Downtown yesterday I stopped by. Ok, right away I had issues. Nowhere to park. I found a spot on the street and paid 2 bucks for metered parking.( And worried about a break in since the neighborhood is real bad)  We are not starting off well. I then walked the two blocks to the restaurant. Being 10:30 am on a Tuesday I figured the normal 1-2 hour wait would not apply to me, yet the place was not dead. ( Hmmmm, good sign in today's economy) I had to sit outside for a little while but the wait was less than 10 minutes and the woman who worked there was very nice.                                                                                                              The place is an old dive. Now don't get me wrong I love old buildings. Super fan of Coronado Cafe, Teeter house, and other old houses renovated into eating establishments but this place is not one of those. Frankly, it is pretty gross. Small and old looking with uneven floors. It only has 6 tables  or so and a tiny bar. No wonder the wait. The menu only has 6 things on the Brkfst side and 5 or so on the lunch side. I ordered a Salami Scrambled Egg plate with Rosemary potatoes.Maybe I  am not an EGGSpert so I couldn't tell what the big deal was and why they are quoted as being so much better than elsewhere. Now, they are cage free eggs and cooked in butter. They tasted good but I didn't like have a heart attack or moaning fit over them or anything. The Rosemary Potatoes were good but nothing I would wait in line hours for. I have had better. The coffee tasted average. Now, the bread was a different story YUMMERS! Smashing! I asked them if it was homemade and they said they get it at Wildflower Bakery. Soooo I am thinking to myself there are plenty of those in town. I will just go there next time. No wait or parking issues. I ordered an egg salad sandwich to go. Which was delish, BTW and the Homemade Mac salad was outstanding. So, my foodie fingers type, What's the big deal? Did I order the wrong thing? Why the fuss? What am I missing here?  It was very good I agree but Oprah and Guy Fierro????? REALLY? The service was fine. Everyone was nice.  I did go off hours so small wait. I honestly don't know how it made the Food Channel or why people wait three hours in the heat to eat here.  \n   I would go back sure but if I had never heard of the place I wouldn't have ranked it even in the top 100 of my favorite dining experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WAIT IS WORTH IT! Most breakfast places in Phx., even the so called better ones, are medicore to say the least.  I've lived here my entire life and I can honestly say this is the best breakfast I've ever had in Phoenix. I definitely will go back and wait again. Skip H.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had breakfast here yesterday morning - early on a weekday with one of my best friends, and had no waiting time.  It was a really nice meal and the staff was really pleasant.  The decor is a little too bright for this early morning wanderer.  I'm not a morning person - I need time to wake up & charge up for the day.  I don't suggest this place for any more than 2.  I suggest avoiding the crowds and going early so that the experience isn't tainted.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest breakfast in town that I have had the pleasure to sample in Phoenix\nYou will likely have to wait a while to get in, and seating is limited.  If you take a big party, you should be ready to wait a bit longer.  The food is always done great, and they have a daily special.  The ingredients are part of the success, and they use local fresh organic ingredients in the food.  The waffle is the best on that I have ever had in my life.  The eggs and ham or bacon are mucho terrific.  My cousin is a fan of he chop and eggs, and that its two healthy pork chops with eggs and sides.  I have eaten most of the stuff on the menu, and there is only one clunker in my book.  that is the home made potato chips with lunch items.  They are a little heavy for my taste, and its would be nice to see fries with stuff like a huge butter burger.  Sample the organic lemonade, and you won't be disappointed.  The restaurant is close to the light rail, so you could go there on that, and parking is limited.  Visit Matt's BB and you will be back without a doubt.  This is the kind of place that is more old school, and if you want a lot of space and don't want to be close to your fellow diners, you might not like the dining experience.  I see more of these kinds of places popping up now in Phoenix, and it is a great trend in having a more varied palette in the dining experience beyond the huge chains that seem to dominate such new cities like Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I really want to add to the love-fest? Yes I do.\n\nI've been here twice, and gotten in once (the wait got me the other visit). But now that I've made it inside, I can tell you that the wait is well worth it.\n\nM had it as simple as you can get: A single egg, scrambled. And it was light, fluffy and perfect.\n\nI had the Honey Lemonade and wish I could have it every day. \n\nI also had the waffle & Bacon, both were amazing. The thick cut peppery bacon is soo good. I don't eat a lot of pork; so for me to love bacon, it's a big deal.  The waffle is the best I've ever had. the exterior is perfectly golden brown, and the inside is like eating a cloud. A tasty tasty cloud.\n\nWait it out, it's worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's be positive.  Matt's has the best waffles I have ever had. And the pancakes are pretty darn amazing. \n\nBut, Matt's has too many rules. Especially for a diner-style resturant. I feel like every time I go there, I leave being pissed off about something.\n\nFirst, NO substituions.  I'm a vegetarian and most of their dishes come with a side a meat.  I would rather have a side of potatoes (and that is cheaper for the resturant than a side of meat). But, NO substituions. I have to order \"no meat\" and then pay for a side of potatoes. C'mon, now.\n \nAlso, NO outside beverages.  Matt's is located in an epicenter of amazing local coffee shops.  I would like to enjoy a handcrafted latte from Lola's instead of Matt's drip with breakfast - but the waitress will jump on your butt about that coffee cup before you even sit down.\n \nLoosen up, Matt. It's a diner.\n\nAwesome tip: Matt's does take-out orders. If you're craving some yummy pancakes on a Sunday morning and have no desire to stand outside for 90 minutes - call it in! It will be ready in 15 minutes and you can enjoy a local latte with it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is this? A restaurant for ants? I don't want to hear any excuses! The building has to be at least... Three times bigger than this!\"\n\nOn a more serious note, this is a teeny, tiny restaurant - so small that the first action of order is to write your name on a notepad that is waiting on a small table outside the entrance. Then expect to wait outside until there is space inside, because there is simply no space to stand and wait inside. But when you do manage to stick a foot in the door, Matt's Big Breakfast invites you in to a cheery, diner-esque environment but with fresh flowers on the table and nicer than average cutlery to boot. Like the establishment, the menu is small. We ordered the Salami Scramble and the Chop & Chick.\n\nSALAMI SCRAMBLE\nThough I can always appreciate a bacon and eggs type breakfast, the peppery punch of the salami scramble was a nice change from the classic. Of course breakfast isn't breakfast without some made-from-scratch hash browns that were crispy but not too oily. I generally like my browns a little less fried, but I still enjoyed these taters nonetheless.\n\nCHOP & CHICK\nThe pork chop was expertly seasoned which was right up my alley, because huge hunks of just meat just doesn't hit the spot. Huge hunks of meat with lots o' spices though? Oh yes.\n\nAll in all, a nice experience at this charming little restaurant. I would definitely visit when I want some good ol' meat and potatoes for breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal owned, Local Grown this place is all the hype and more.  We ride our cruisers here for breakfast and even before we get in for work.  Why? This place has a warm feel to it and the food is AWESOME!  They have daily egg specials that are remarkable.  The Honey Lemonade is fresh and like no other in town.  It gets busy so get in early and put your name in the notepad at the door.  I would not recommend for large parties, because they are very small. Steak and Eggs every Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought the food was really good here. I went just like everyone else because of Diners, Drive-in's and Dives and some other local input. I can't even tell you how long we waited. It was unbelievable. The quality was good and the price was great. I would have given it 4 stars if we didn't wait outside for at least 2 hours. The place only holds like 5 tables so the service better be good. We have not been back because it's hard to justify that length of time waiting to eat.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendly service, great atmosphere, excellent coffee (they have their own house blend of a local coffeemaker) and phenomenal food!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes anyone actually wait more than once for this?  We waited 1 hour; thankfully, it was a beautiful morning.  Once inside we had trouble sitting on the bar stools, they are so small and slippery.(We aren't large people)\n  I stood up to eat my breakfast.  My husband enjoyed his Iowa pork chop, but my ham and cheese omelet was generic.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://stevelerer.com\n\nI traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.\n\nThe restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.\n\nThe last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.\n\nAll in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.\n\nOverall Review: 7/10\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was at Pizzeria Bianco, the second in line peeps mentioned that I try Matt's Big Breakfast. I had also saw the episode on Triple D with Guy Fieri and the dude raved that this was his fave. Now I had already put it on the \"must go\" list and then asked for recommendations. I was told to expect an hour wait, order the waffles or griddlecakes and the pork rib chop. Good info...\n\nIt was ambitious of us to want to wake up early to have Matt's, but we did eventually get there, even with the stoopid Android GPS getting us lost at First Ave and not First St. We had made a few passes around the block and saw the farmer's market diagonally from Matt's. I dropped off Kathy to put our names down, parked in the lot and headed over to the farmer's market. Now, you couldn't plan this any better, but the market is open Sat and Weds, so what better way to kill time, instead of sitting in heat? After about 40 mins, we headed back and got called immediately.\n\nWe got in and ordered waffles with a side of the griddlecakes, since Kathy couldn't decide. I went for the pesto crusted pork rib chop with home fries that were Yukon gold potatoes grilled with rosemary and onions and two eggs over easy. The batter used for both the waffles/griddlecakes were light and fluffy and when you factor in the homemade whipped butter and authentic Vermont maple syrup, the combination is Dyno-mite! My pork rib chop was tender and moist and the Yukon gold fries were absolutely perfect. The thick toast with a side of peach marmalade was delicious. I'm stoked they use locally grown produce, as that ensures that the food is always tip top. The super thick bacon that came with the waffles were just perfect balance of salt and savor. Simply bueno!\n\nI'm always in awe of the other reviewers who were expecting some Iron Chef to blow them away with spectacular gourmet food. To do the basic breakfast items and take them to another level should be spectacular in itself. I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast for simplistic elegance and for breakfast that truly did deserve Guy Fieri's adulation.\n\nHousekeeping items: Go Saturdays, so you can check out the Farmer's Market with all the free and tasty samples. That should keep you busy as your name floats to top of the wait list. The wait staff wants to turn over tables, so other Yelpers can get in and eat too. \n\nStay hungry my friends and happy eatings...\n\n\n\n\n\nI've decided to make this one short and sweet...\n\nThe Menu - Too Small.\nThe Food - Good, but nothing special.\nThe Service - Stellar.\nThe Aesthetics - Cute, 5&Diner-ish, CRAMPED!\nThe Wait - Too long & clearly not worth it.\n\nJust because Guy Fieri ate here...Puh-leeze. 2 Stars because I genuinely appreciate a warm and attentive wait staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had my first experience with Matt's this morning. A friend of mine had seen it on Diner's, Dives and Drive In's (or something along those lines) and was excited to try it out. The wait was about 20 minutes(arrived at 9 am) and seating is very limited but worth it!\n\nI'm all about the breakfast food so I was excited to try somewhere new. The menu is limited but covers all bases. The coffee (a special blend just for them) is local as is everything that they serve. I swear the bacon tastes better when it's from around the corner.\n\nI decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns. SUPER YUMMY!! I appreciate the note on the menu that they only use butter and extra virgin olive oil... No trans fats here! The hash browns were a bit oily but tasty overall.\n\nAs I was leaving I saw a huge stack of pancakes on their way to a table... I know what I'm getting next time!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Matt's...wait in line if you have to...fight for parking...just go.  I don't like going too early, as the American fried potatoes haven't had the opportunity to soak in enough rosemary and get that nice crisp crust from the grill yet.\n\nHands down, the best breakfast I've had in the Valley.  Bacon arrives fresh each day...I think everything does.  Coffee is terrific and then there's this woman...(Matt's wife), who just simply lights up the place.  \n\nI go to restaurants a lot...more than most...more than I probably should.  I will go once on a recommendation from someone.  I will go back again, if the place measures up.  If I go back more frequently, it's because of the people.  And Matt's is about the people.\n\nI've met great people there and although I maybe get there 5-6 times a year, they remember me.  That's cool...and very important.\n\nSimply put, I have not found a meal there I haven't liked, but most often, the Special of the Day is just out of the world delicious.  Also, just trust me here...get the American fried potatoes...again...trust me.  Delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook, there is no reason for you to read the 51st review on this place unless you specifically sought me out and you trust me.  Matt's is good!  Go stuff yo face in a waffle and that thick cut bacon.  Mmm!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this spot - it's pretty close to the convention center so Natalie and I went here to check it out. The bacon is awesome here!\n\nTheir philosophy is great too - local, organic, etc. etc.  The place is tiny and quaint too and as always it's great to support a local independent business.  \n\nBest breakfast in Phoenix that i've had and definitely one of my fave spots - went there the next day too - got the special and it was delish - check my photos to see what we got!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's always a gamble when I stop in at Matt's because the line is unpredictable.  However, the fact that there IS a line should tell you that this place is pretty stellar.  Because I'm a creature of habit, I don't normally order anything besides the special or the hog and chick.  You really can't go wrong with either.  Every dish is made with high quality ingredients.  I always rave to my friends about how the spinach in the special was the most spinachy spinach I've ever tasted (that's a good thing).  Thick slices of peppery bacon = party in my mouth.  Their caramelized onions tossed with perfectly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside potatoes are also a different yet equally awesome party in my mouth.  What gets me every time is their thick slice of toast and organic preserves.  SO GOOD.  And a coffee mug that's never empty, that's always a plus too.  Matt, I don't know who you are but your breakfasts are delightful.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, so here's the deal. The griddlecakes here are delicious. And I mean good. Everything else is not so good.... I found that out this morning. So we waited for awhile and were seated in the back of the little room, not the one with the kitchen. The roof was leaking right next to us from the rain last night and it kind of smelled weird. Also, the service was not so good.... we asked for cream and never got it.... asked again.... finally got it. And this coffee needs it badly... so bad. And I'm still mad they stopped serving cream and started serving some fat free garbage. So anyway, I went with the BF for breakfast and he was getting the griddlecakes and I didn't want to get the same thing as him so I ordered the salami scramble. That thing was inedible. It had so much salami that was so fatty... the only thing I could taste was fat. Not pleasant. And the salami's texture was really chewy and weird too.... the home fries that come with it are good, the toast is not so great... came with blueberry preserves which was also not great. HOWEVER, go get the griddlecakes. They are awesome. I just can't say a place is four stars when only one thing is five stars and everything else is like 2. So there ya go. Go get some of delicious grandma's griddlecakes of awesomeness. Skip everything else.\n\nUpdate: The BF and I went again today..... what a disappointment. His bacon was waaay too peppery.... like he didn't eat it, it was inedible. ugh. We waited over an hour and got seated at the counter.... pretty lame. Got the hotcakes...they were still good, but I just don't think I'll be back here anytime soon. Sorry guys.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat breakfast spot in Phoenix! Hash browns were incredibly buttery and creamy, the special 3 meat scramble w/pepperjack cheese was excellent, and the kids liked the pancakes.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#mOrO9Ye3lyhOiv-mD-K_JQ\n\nThey recently moved to a new location at 1st St/Garfield since being featured on DDD. Look for this mural as you go down 1st St.:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#6zWWyXZVsPp83YplKgGr5g\n\nCozy little place has 12 tables and a breakfast bar section to hold maybe 50(?) people in there. Apparently it's no secret because we attempted to go at 9:00a on a Saturday morning. WHOA. 1hr+ wait. \n\nWe tried again at 1:30pm the same day and there was no line. So if you can't get there at 6:30am when they open, I would recommend going after the lunch crowd dies down, before they close at 2:30p. Look at how empty it gets:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#l4u6G9p-5Jzlbw7oS2kCjA\n\nAt that time you can order off the breakfast OR lunch menu, if they haven't sold out of everything by then.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.\n\nI had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. \n\nBy default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.\n\nThe girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.\n\nI can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!\n\n\n\n\n\nYUMMMMY!  What more can I say, great service and exceptional food!  Everything is fresh and cooked to perfection.  We only waited a little while to be seated, but good things are worth the wait.  We will be back for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThumbs Up!\n\nI vouch Matt's Hog & Chick is worth the long wait!\n\n\n\n\n\nI usually steer-clear of places that are rumored to have a long ass wait but my Mama selected this place for her birthday brunch, needless to say it was a yummy breakfast. We got there around 815 and were seated around 9, so if youre being leisurely, its worth the wait.\n\nThe menu is small and concise, making it somewhat easy to decide; it all looks and sounds so good. But it's all pretty basic meals with a couple of daily specials. One of which I had; scrambled eggs, jalapenos, cheese, onions, and a shit ton of delicious, partnered with home-fries and a tortilla. The jalapenos were just right and so fresh! We also had tried some of the walnut, raisin bread toast; which was fantastic. My boyfriend had the waffle which was good but I could tell he could use another one ($8 for one waffle?). I don't eat swine too often but the bacon was heavenly; thick and peppered. One thing I do regret about the meal was I saw someone order some chocolate milk, definitely should've got some instead of coffee; what's the rush to wake up on a Sunday anyway?\n\nWhen we came out, some people who had been waiting near us, were asking what we got and how it was. It seemed our leaving Matt's got everyone outside's mounths watering. Everyone lit up to hear our reviews, which I thought was pretty funny...So all-in-all it was good but nothing so amazing (which is what I've heard about this place). Great for a special occasion or once in awhile.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile visiting Phoenix for a family reunion: we saw this breakfast spot had more reviews than any other spot. It's bright, cozy& the staff is super dooper friendly. The bacon! Oh my bacon. I had a Blt w/pesto instead of mayo. The mixed berry honey lemonade was yummy! Annnd Chelsea, ridiculously sweet & full of charm. Awesome service! So awesome, that I left my new sunglasses at the table and she came chasing us out to give them to me. \n\nIt's only 4 stars because I wish their menu was a tad more extensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like a douche bag for giving Matt's only 1 stars when everyone else raves about this place and the owner truly is such a delight so in my defense let me explain:\nThis place is a hot spot, every time I've tried to go there, it's packed.  Each time, I've never wanted to wait so I went on my way.\nOne Sunday, I was just down the street from them at Valley Youth Theatre watching Winnie the Pooh with my son and I thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward.  When we got out of the theatre, it was pouring rain in giant buckets, one of those rarities in Phoenix where you can't see what's in front of you cause it's raining so hard.  Well, we braved the rain and drove to Matt's~ 5 mins. after their posted closing time and yup, you guess it~ despite me and my 3 1/2 year old son drenched wet and  looking pleadingly at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhile to get out of the rain, they told us they were closed and sent us on our way.  Talk about tough standards~ I guess when you are as popular as Matt's you get to make and stick by the rules you make.\nDespite that experience, I still wanted to try Matt's because of all the applaudes I've heard about the place. Finally I made it there on one of those days when I had the time for the long wait and sadly for me, I was sorely disappointed by the breakfast served to me.\nI had remembered reading some article about the BIG BREAKFAST served at Matt's and that's what I was expecting.  I ordered the waffle with bacon for $9 expecting a Denny's portion of food but with flavor and excellence.  The place was packed so I had to wait 30mins for my waffle to materialize in front of me.  When I got the one piece of waffle and one piece of bacon served to me, I thought perhaps while waiting I had accidentally swallowed Alice (in Wonderland) tonic and was now a giant looking at my rather small serving of food on my plate.  Seriously, I almost felt tears come into my eyes, I was so disappointed.  Needless to say, after trying so many times to go to Matt's and finally getting there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kidding me?  where's the rest of my food experience, I will not go back there.  It's a good thing too cause it's far from my house and I hate waiting!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's not to love? \n\nCool small-diner atmosphere, crazy good food, ginormous portions, decent coffee (so many places underestimate the power of a good cup of joe), and you can laugh at Guy's stencil near the register. \n\n4-egg chorizo and jalapeno scramble... if you see it on the board, GET IT.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chop and the Chick..............oh my pesto encrusted pork chop will I ever get to have you again? It was over 100 degrees, it was over an hour wait, but they keep ice water outside so you don't die, and, in my opinion, its worth the wait to experience dining inside- at least once. After that if you wanna come back, just order your goods to go. \n\nBut back to the pork chop.......it was incredible. It was perfectly cooked, and sometimes Porkchops are hit or miss when it comes to moist and dry. But this chop was plump and moist and pesto-y and out of this world. The ambiance and decor of this place was retro-vintage-mod, mostly white w/little but unique decor.  I loved my dining experience there, from the service to the food.  I'd definitely come back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm pretty pumped that its cooling off outside cause I'll be able to make my way down to Matt's for breakfast on Saturdays again. I tend to stay away during the summer months cause I sweat like a fat kid in a cannibal camp and would rather not wait the hour or so it takes to be seated. \n\nVery few places in town do I feel as \"at home\" as I do at Matt's. The staff is always friendly as are most of the patrons. For such a long wait and for the patrons to be in such good moods they have to be doing something right! The food is fantastic. I love how they find locally grown and raised food and only stock what is in season. The food alone makes Matt's one of my favorite spots for breakfast in town, but its the consistency in the ambiance that makes it my #1 breakfast spot in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nI know this isn't going to sit well with a lot of Yelpers, but I was markedly underwhelmed by Matt's.  I had high expectations considering the avid reviews (and the feature on the Food Network), but frankly, I was disappointed.\n\nI was expecting quite the wait to be seated considering the popularity of the place (and the line when I got there), but since I was dining alone, I was seated immediately.  Unfortunately, my seat was at a bar along a window that faced the hot Arizona sun.  I had to wear sunglasses while dining.\n\nI started with a cup of coffee.  It was fresh, but not particularly flavorful.  Anyway, that's not really where I'm hung up on this place.  What do you expect for a buck thirty-five?  No, my issue was with my food.\n\nHere's what I ordered: a Salami Scramble (basically scrambled eggs with salami) and a side of bacon.  The Salami Scramble was served with hash browns and toast.  The biggest disappointment of the meal was easily the Salami Scramble.  Having read good things about the entree, and upon recommendation of my server, I was excited to try the scramble.  Unfortunately, the scramble failed to live up to the hype. While the eggs were cooked perfectly (not too rubbery and not too runny), the overall flavor was off-putting.  The salami tasted okay, but in conjunction with the eggs, and the overpowering use of herbs, the final product was less than delicious.  Even after slathering the whole thing in catsup and hot sauce, the herbal and earthy overtones were overpowering.  I had the same problem with the hash browns: they were entirely overpowered with herbs.  I found myself actively trying to pick out the rosemary permeating the potatoes.\n\nAs far as the bacon goes, it was undercooked.  I like my bacon relatively crispy, perhaps more than others, but still, this was very chew.  The toast was fine.\n\nBecause of how much positive buzz this place has I may try it again - perhaps I was the victim of a rare poorly prepared meal here.  As it stands now, though, I'm less than enthused.\n\nLay off the herbs - they're best used sparingly.  They're potatoes, not a salad.\n\n\n\n\n\nok. parking here totally sucks. luckily, we ate here early in the day, and people were leaving, so we waited a bit and took their spot. (when going downtown, carpool, people!) we were promptly seated, and just in time, as a bunch of people came in 5 minutes later, and had to wait outside. \n\ni had the daily special of chorizo with eggs and jalapenos, my bf had the sausage and eggs combo (forgot its actual name). i personally don't really care for rosemary, but if you like it, the potatoes will rock your socks off. we were both stuffffffed. the food was incredibly hot, fresh and delish (and spicy!). service was fast... so we were happy. until we thought about how much butter we were consuming. but bc it was so yummy, that we decided we didn't care. \n\n the homemade toast and preserves were also pretty killer. even though i was stuffed to the brim, i ended up eating my bf's last piece of toast and preserves as we walked out. they were that good.\n\ni just wish there were more menu options...\n\n\n\n\n\nA great local place for a filling breakfast!  Just get ready to wait for a table...the space is small but they do a good job of getting people in and out quickly!\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Butter Burger is THE dish to have here! Matt starts his lunch menu @ 11am. The breakfast here is good don't get me wrong just skip breakfast & go 4 the butter burger. Also make sure u don't park on the empty dirt parking lots in front of & behind Matt's or you'll get a $120.00 ticket! Park on the paved streets/lots only & keep in mind parking is limited.\n\n\n\n\n\nI rode on the bus and saw this little diner on the corner of North First Street and McKinley Ave. And of course, the name also attracted (ahem) yours truly. \n\nThis is \"not\" a big diner at all. Its well-bright lights make this diner very reassuring. There also numerous awards from various sources posted throughout this small restaurant including the top restaurants voted by the Food Network. Hopefully there will be a Yelp-sticker posted on the door. \n\nUnfortunately my meal at \"Matt's\" breakfast place at noon happens to be for lunch. They do serve breakfast all day till closing at 2:30 pm. I had a craving for a Reuben Sandwich. My $7.50 sandwich had fresh Corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss-cheese, and Thousand-Island dressing in a pair of grilled dark-rye bread. My tasty sandwich comes with home-made fried potatoes. I also bought an endless cup of fresh locally grown coffee to wash my sandwich down. \n\nI enjoyed my meal on a table near a window where I can watch the busy streets and view of the desert over the mountain. \n\nI paid my $11.00 meal with Visa. I actually enjoy my meal at my own restaurant.  With the waitress being very friendly, I taught them well. It's also a good thing that I came on a weekday; because I would imagine that my diner would be crowded on the weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\nFate led me to dine at Matt's Big Breakfast yesterday. We drove by this tiny restaurant while on our way to find somewhere to eat brunch. The sign indicated that they are closed on Mondays but we saw people eating inside so we sent a representative to inquire. I should note that the restaurant closes at 2:30pm and we arrived at 2:25. The waitresses were more than happy to serve us even though they were technically not supposed to be open. Score!\n\nI ordered the insider burger (not on the menu) and it was honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had! How is this possible, you ask? First off, the meat is cooked in butter. You heard me right. Butter. Second, the burger is topped with 2 eggs AND bacon. As if this weren't enough to convince you, it comes with a side of homemade chips and a pickle. Love it! I didn't even care that my face was covered in egg yolk.\n\nIf you're more in the mood for breakfast, Matt's has plenty of options. Their breakfast potatoes have the most intense rosemary flavoring, the bacon is thick and tasty and their homemade toast and jam is wonderful. Order anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed. This is a great restaurant with friendly service and awesome food.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was cold for a Phoenix morning (upper 30s over-night) and I stood outside the hospital splashed in sunlight, surrounded by palm-trees and (oddly) shivering despite my wool army-drab button-down and $3 coffee. The doctor's visit went well and my spirits were high. Surgery was not an option. For now.\n\nA few minutes later, my host arrived in a green VW Rabbit. I love the new rabbits. She needed to get some work accomplished and I needed to address some email. A few (Phoenix) minutes later, we arrived at the coffee-shop. I ordered a mug of coffee and picked up a business card. Lux? That sounds familiar... Oh my goodness! LUX! I shot their first cover on top of the Smithfield at 5.30 on a Sunday morning in 2007 and the magazine was named after the coffee-shop in Phoenix where Mark and Cindy birthed the idea.\n\nThe world is tiny.\n\n---\n\n\"My work is done. You wanna get breakfast?\"\n\n\"Do you even have to ask? What was that place you told me about before I left Philadelphia?\"\n\n\"Matt's. But there's another place I thought of that you might like as well.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah? What's that?\"\n\n\"The Welcome Diner.\"\n\n\"Lemme find it on Yelp and I'll think about it.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"This is hard. I can't decide. Let's just go to Matt's. I'll do the Welcome in the Spring when I come back.\"\n\n---\n\nThe West is a unique place. The cities are different - spread out. The architecture is different, too. I can't describe it. It just feels like it belongs here in the desert. Form over function. Matt's fits in just this way. It's tiny inside and everything's painted white. A few photographs in white mats with white frames take up the rest of the wall space. The small bar occupies a quarter of the main dining area and four diner-orange tables decorated with desert plants take up the rest of the crowded and intimate space which is by now teeming with locals who're there to gather a late morning brunch.\n\nThere were two specials that morning and once our server mentioned the first, I couldn't remember anything else, but I told her that I needed some more time so that I could neatly arrange my table for a shot of the menu. When she came back I ordered the three-egg scramble with red peppers, spicy sausage (all their pork comes from Iowa!) and provolone cheese. A side of shredded hash-browns accompanied this beautiful breakfast feast.\n\nFor a joint that stays as busy as it does, the prices are fantastic. (I think everything's cheaper in Phoenix). Before tip, my tab was right around $12 and for the quality and quantity of food that I received in one of Phoenix's most popular spots, I had no complaints.\n\nWhen I make a return visit to the Valley of the Sun in April, I'll be sure to make myself an out-of-town-regular at this wonderful little place.\n\n...And maybe next time I'll run into Nate Ruess.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband came to my work to have lunch with me the other day and being how all I hear about in this area is Matt's, I decided we would go try it. So we pulled up outside and found a parking spot, WOOHOO!! (there seemed to be limited spaces unless you want to meter it) I looked at the outside and was again scared of the size (I really do have claustrophobia) but decided I was going in! It was VERY small but we got a table in the \"back room\" which cracked me up because there is this really small step to get to it and all the workers' kept saying \"watch your step\", it was just really funny. \n\nSo, I had the cheese omelet and home potatoes with bacon. It was delicious! My husband had the salami and egg scramble with hash browns and LOVED it! This is our new favorite breakfast spot! The only bad thing was the restroom which has been mentioned in other reviews, it's next door at the motel which is not so desirable so go to the bathroom before you go to Matt's and everything should be fine. The service was excellent and I will definitely be back, oh and no wait! It must have been my lucky day!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen wanting to come here since it was featured on Food Networks Diners, Drive-Ins& Dives. Guy Fieri knows good food so this was the first place I thought of when my parents wanted to grab breakfast in Phoenix. Luckily, on a Monday afternoon, we avoided the rush, and only waited 5 minutes! Score! Now on to the grub.\n\nA lot of the food here is locally grown, they use cage-free eggs, and they even make their own jam/preservatives. I loved everything we ordered. Pancakes were different- they are very sweet- no need for any syrup. The hash browns were very good, but very heavy- and a bit soggy (which I actually prefer). The toast is large, freshly baked, and served with real butter. (nothing beats real butter!) My pork chop was very tasty and seasoned just right. Also, our server was a sweetheart, very helpful and patient. \n\nTip- try the homemade berry lemonade if available\nTip- call ahead to find out about the wait- avoid the rush! \nTip- as mentioned in almost all other reviews, this place is very tiny- not a good for large parties or the claustrophobic.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, this place was worth the wait. My friends and I got there at 10:30AM and the wait was about 45min. Thankfully there was a farmers market across the street to keep me busy. \n\nMatt's was very small and there were no bathrooms inside of building. Strange floor plan. I ordered a Cheese Omelet with peppers and ham, coffee, and OJ. The coffee was heavenly...it was what I've been looking for all morning. The OJ was surprisingly tiny...the glass was as tall my fingers, but it was very fresh. The omelet came with a side of home fries or hash browns and bread. I HIGHLY recommend the home fries, which is chopped potatoes cooked with onions and rosemary. I got the wheat bread which was delicious. This is not your typical plain/thin wheat toast!  The omelet was huge and so were the ingredients. The peppers which I thought was be sprinkled in like most places was actually a whole sauteed pepper. The ham was smokey and thick. The serving was pretty good for a $10 breakfast. \n\nOverall, I think Matt's is superior to other popular breakfast joint such as the Breakfast Club or Orange Table. It was worth the wait, but I'll definitely be more strategic regarding the timing the next time around.\n\n\n\n\n\n100% love this place. I've been three times, all when passing through Phoenix, and I will be surely sorry if this place ever changes. I appreciate their choice to use fresh, wholesome ingredients, and their food is delicious. Amazing hash browns, fresh juice, homemade preserves, great bread! Everything is tops. The only bummer is that it's always packed, but I don't hold that against them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlink and you might miss where Matt's Big Breakfast is located. But don't let the small size of this breakfast hot spot fool you, nor let the long wait deter you. Matt's had been right around the corner from me, and I had no idea until today what I had been missing out on. A group of friends and I all sprung for the daily special of scrambled eggs incorporated with hot links, white cheese, and peppers paired with delicious home fries. So while the wait, especially during a blustery summer day in Phoenix may make you want to stray, don't, and you will be in for a treat!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was disappointed too.  I waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me, but if you've got long legs your only option is to sit spread-eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there's not that much legroom to each side.  In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves. \nThe waffles next to me looked fabulous, but I'm not a fan.   Basically I didn't think it wasn't worth the hour wait in 100 degrees and I was relieved to get outside where there was some breathing room.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome food in a fun setting.  Small place - only about 10 tables plus 4 seats at bar but worth a wait! Go during non peak times and you won't have to wait as long.  The fresh juice was good but in a TINY glass.  \nIt is a fun place but not sure I would wait over an hour for it!\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, I've wanted to try Matt's for a while, but I had drivien by and seen how small it was and heard of the long lines to get in. When I get up, I'm hungry and ready to eat...\n\nI happened to get up early last Saturday and thought \"Hey, maybe I can get a seat at Matt's if I get over there early!\" In a few minutes, my companion and I were on the road and on the way to Matt's as fast as her little Scion XB could carry us...\n\nMy master plan was a success and we were seated within minutes of arriving. I ordered the Chop & Chick, and my friend ordered the special which was a scramble with chicken sausage, cheese, and greens.\n\nWe were seated at the window bar and enjoyed several cups of good diner coffee (nice and strong, without being bitter) while we waited... \n\nand waited... and waited...\n\nWe noticed several tables come and go while we were waiting and as we were starting to get worried, Matt came to our table and apologetically told us that our ticket had fallen and gotten lost for a while and that our food was their top priority at that point. In the next five minutes, I'm pretty sure that every employee came by to apologize to us and ask if there was anything that they could get for us.\n\nWhen our food did arrive is was steaming hot and delicious. \n\nThe Chop & Chick was exactly as one would expect. Perfectly cooked over-easy eggs, no gooey whites, but plenty of liquid yolk with which to dip my home fries in. The pork chop was of average breakfast size, but cooked well and still nice and juicy.\n\nMy companion's special scramble was so good that it made me question my undying love of the majikal animal (pork) and the hash browns were awesomely crispy (but begging to be covered in gravy ;-)\n\nAs we ate, Matt came by and apologized again for losing our ticket and asked us to enjoy our breakfast on the house. It was so good that I kinda felt bad about taking them up on their offer, but I decided that I'd make it up to them by going out of my way for more early breakfasts there.\n\nSo, was it a perfect breakfast experience? No.\nBut the manner in which the mistake was handled, the professionalism of the staff, and the quality of the food puts Matt's Big Breakfast at or near the top of my Phoenix breakfast list.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't get the rave reviews or how anybody can claim that this is the \"be all, end all\" for breakfast.  \n\nPros-\nA friendly server\nDecent bacon, though heavy on the pepper\n\nCons-\nOverpriced for what you get-$7.50 for pancakes a la carte and my personal favorite $1.25 extra charge for more syrup!  With a side of bacon and a coffee that meal alone was $12 before tax & gratuity.\n1 slice of toast with a 2 egg breakfast...who does that?\n6oz Orange Juice....$2.50!\nThree in your party, oh I'm sorry you will have to squeeze into the corner with an extra chair because we won't seat you at a table for four is how the visit started!\n\nI understand why everyone claims that it is always so busy, there might be 20 seats in the entire place!  Not going to be back any time soon with all of the other options downtown for breakfast these days.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly pancake orgasm, Batman!  \n\nThe richest. smoothest. buttery-est, fullest, fluffiest, tastiest cooked-to-perfection pancakes you'll ever eat. Those of us who haven't had the pleasure of dining at Matt's thought we knew a good pancake... WRONG!  Matt's is where it's at, 1/2 hr-1 hr wait and all (We were seated in 1/2hr Tuesday @ 10am).  \n\nThe restaurant is very busy, so one cannot expect the servers to build rapport with the customer.  Rather it's more important they keep my coffee and OJ full with a smile, which they did well.\n\nI had the ribeye, eggs and home fries, which was one of the specials of the day.  While my steak was cooked medium when I requested medium-rare, it was delicious, well cooked and seasoned to perfection.  \nEggs over easy done text-book as well, fresh, hot and you can't get any better.\n\nThe portions on most of the orders seemed small, so we had to order some sides which drove up the bill total.  The menu can be inexpensive if you just order one thing, but there are so many great things to try!.. like the fresh strawberry preserves!\n\nHands down this is best breakfast gem in Arizona and I can't wait until we can go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was afraid this place would be overrated, because most breakfast places are. I usually think, how hard is it to cook up some eggs? and most places can't cook pancakes and waffles better than my mom. I was very wrong, this place was so, so, sooooo good. I had the salami egg scramble with hash browns, everything was cooked perfectly. The toast that came with fresh preserves and butter was amazing! My husband had the waffle with REAL maple syrup (a requirement in my mind) and sorry mom, but this one was actually better than yours. With the waffle came a side of the thickest, most flavorful bacon I've ever had. I would come back here for the bacon alone! This place is well worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really don't understand what people are ordering that they say that the serving sizes here are small. My meal came with a pork chop, 2 eggs, and hash browns, which I could barely keep all on my plate (it was so much food) and a side of thick sourdough toast (2 slices). Mike ordered the fives pot which was just a sandwich. Considering we had waited almost an hour for breakfast we also ordered a side of bacon (so yummy!) and one pancake so we could try a few other things. The people sitting next to me at the counter ordered the special omelet which also took up the whole plate. \n\nThis place is so tiny. There were three tables in the main eating area (which could seat 2-3 each), 6 seats at the counter, 3 more seats in the side room at a counter and two spaces where they could seat parties of about 4-5. \n\nAlthough it took quite some time just to get in (and you have to wait outside to be called, keep this in mind if  you are there on a cold day) it doesn't take very long to get your food. It took 10-15 minutes to get our food. By the time we finished they had already turned over all of the tables. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the food was good. My pork chop was juicy and I loved the hash browns and bacon. Mike's five spot wasn't as tasty. The eggs were overcooked and a bit dry. He wished he would have had the pancakes instead. \n\nThey have some good eats.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place. I went there for the first time this morning. It was outstanding. When we where told the wait was over an hour we debated not staying. I am so glad we did. Totally worth it. \n\nEverything was cooked perfect. The homemade bread with preserves was awesome. I got the hashbrowns which where great. So much butter which I know is bad for you but if you are coming here for breakfast I doubt health food is what you are looking for. My girlfriend got the home fries which where actually better. \n\nJust the best breakfast in town period. Go there and wait it out. So worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.  \n\nI wouldn't make a special trip back.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery delicious food! Very quaint atmosphere!  Super busy, so prepare to wait at least 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like Matt's.  I understand some of the criticisms but I also understand the raves.\n\nPros: \n-The food IS good. Some of the items are breakfast basics, sure, but the pancakes are anything but ordinary.  They're almost perfect.   The home fries are great - rosemary goodness. There's also a great menu selection - a nice mix of breakfast standards with unique and special twists.\n-The atmosphere.  Yeah it's small, but it's part of the charm.\n\nCon:\n-It's expensive.  There's no way around it.\n- It IS small.  You will have to wait, sometimes for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile waiting to be seated I was acosted by an agressive panhandler :(  That being said we had coffee while we waited. On to the food...everyone in our party thought it was great...had the Hog & Chick myself.  The menu prices have gone up from what I saw on-line though...need to update their website!  Ernie (Matt's wife) helped us and was very nice. Overall was worth the wait...about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning.  There is a Farmer's Market across the street that you can check out while waiting :)\n\n\n\n\n\nYes you will have to wait. Is it worth it? YES. Today I visited with a friend of mine. I could smell the scent of bacon, coffee which fueled my appetite but I was craving a burger. You know a burger is good when no mayo, mustard, or ketchup are needed. Just the taste os a well cooked burger (side of kettle chips).  Expect a wait, most of the time. Come hungry. Waiting is outside (it is a very, very small building), but worth it. Next time, I will order the breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\n100% bomb! Everything they make oozes amazing, homemade, quality goodness. The pancakes are heaven, the hog and chick is fab, and the rosemary breakfast potatoes are perfect. I have been a handful of times, and it's always worth the wait.\n\nNote: This place is ridiculously small (but charming), so don't go with a bunch of friends and expect to sit together...or be seated anytime soon. Carry out is a good option, but only for those who have had the sit in experience first ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one star review is because having to wait in the heat totally ruined the whole meal. Seeing there were over 600 yelp reviews, I was expecting to wait. However, if you are successful enough to have a long wait for your restaurant, you should provide something to keep the waiting customers cool. Misters maybe? Maybe expand to have a foyer? \n\nWe waited in the 100+ heat for 40+ minutes. They have a list outside you write your name on so no one is there to tell you how long your wait will be. They provide minimal seating and no misters. There's some ice water with oranges to drink with tiny dixie cups (the kind the dentist provides to swish with). By the time we had our pre-order (where they take your order 10 minutes before they seat you so you don't take up a table too long), I wasn't very hungry and definitely didn't want hot eggs.  After finally getting seated, we immediately have hot plates set down in front of us. \n\nI ordered the BLT (again, I did NOT want eggs when I was so hot!) and it just wasn't that good. Way too much crusty bread that scratched the roof of my mouth. The three people I was with ordered scrambles and said they were nothing they couldn't get elsewhere. The bacon and the waffles were very good. \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly and apologetic but it's not their fault and there's nothing they can say to make up for being terribly uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat, real and fresh breakfast in a super cute teeny tiny spot.  The space is so small that they don't even have a bathroom and could probably only serve 20-25 people at a time.  We waited about 15 minutes on a Thursday morning, but i would assume the wait could get scary on the weekends.\n\nThe food was totally spot on.  From the thick sliced perfectly baked bread they use for toast to the honey lemonade, all the small details take this spot to another level.  I ordered the special scramble which was ham, fresh jalapeno and cheese with a side of hash browns.  Tobin ordered the Hog and Chick (pork chop with eggs) and a side of bacon.  While the entire meal hit the spot, the hash browns were the highlight with a perfect balance of crispy top browned bits to the soft buttery layer underneath. The bacon was also legit, perfectly thick cut and cooked to perfect chewy goodness.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, quick and attentive and all seemed to thank us as we as we finished up and walked out.  \n\nThis place is a definite must see as it is everything restaurants in up-and-coming neighborhoods should be.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love places like this.  Had the hog and chick: eggs over easy, thick cut bacon (you always know a good spot if their bacon is legit), hash browns and homemade sourdough toast. Totally solid and cheap.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome food and worth the wait.  My sis and I showed up at 10 am on a Wednesday morning.  Had to wait about 5 min.  All waitresses care about everyone and not just their own table.  Sis had the chop n chik.. I had the special...  Some sort of vienna Guada sausage scramblers with cheese....  AHhh-- mazingly good!!!   Juice, preserves, and milk all taste super fresh.  Some of the best hashbrowns I have ever tasted.  Have the perfect crispyness but yet the right texture in the middle.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps if I waited outside in the heat for an hour plus to the point that I became starved and dehydrated, I too would have thought Matt's was worthy of 5 stars. Or maybe the 5 star reviews come from people too ashamed to admit that they wasted most of their morning on a very average breakfast.\n\nIn my case, we came here before 7am on a Friday and got the last available seats by the window. Service was great; I didn't detect any attitudes from the waitstaff that has been mentioned in some reviews. They got our meal out quickly and made sure our coffee mugs never got empty.\n\nWith the exception of the toast and jam, the food never rose above \"good.\" Isn't that pretty sad that the best offering from a breakfast diner is the bread? I liked my waffle since it was a bit crisper than what I can do at home with my geriatric waffle iron, but there was nothing noteworthy about the flavor. My husband said his eggs were cooked perfectly with his chop and chick dish, but the pork chop was under-seasoned. He found the hashbrowns way too greasy to be enjoyable, and the bacon suffered from being overcooked.\n\nMaybe we're spoiled since we have two great breakfast places within walking distance (Joe's Farm Grill and the Coffee Shop). Matt's just isn't worth the drive or wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally made it to Matt's Big Breakfast.  I was prepared to wait a bit so didn't really mind that part, but they do need more seats in the shade.  \n\nThe menu at Matt's is somewhat limited.  While I like to keep things simple and can easily get overwhelmed by those menus with zillions of options, I was annoyed by the 'no substitutions' policy.  There was a daily special posted on the board that had jalapenos and sausage.  I don't eat sausage, so I asked if I could get a vegetable instead.  The answer was no.  Okay fine.  Could they add jalapeno to one of the dishes that didn't come with sausage?  No.  Ugh.  I ended up ordering the cheese omelet and paying $1 each for onion and red peppers.  \n\nI couldn't get enough of the hash browns, although unfortunately they were probably loaded with butter.  Good thing I went to kickboxing that day.  Overall this is a cute little restaurant with great food.  Just be prepared to wait and plan on your food being made Matt's way, not your way.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously, what the fuck are you people waiting in those long ass lines for?  Did I miss something?  Are they giving handies in the restroom... wait... do they even have a restroom?\n\nIt's so small, it's impossible to not have people in your personal bubble and who wants strangers breathing on them when they're trying to eat?  The servers are these bitchy girls that argue with each other and one looked so dirty I wanted to squirt her with my hand sanitizer each time she passed by me.  \n\nThe food - it's a normal breakfast.  Nothing about the meal made me think I was having something special.  Yes, the bacon was good but really, have you ever had bad bacon?  They don't have fountain drinks, just canned RC so I stuck to coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\nbasically i dont give a rat's **s on what the majority say i have never been treated like this in my life! saw it on foodnetwork, we just moved to az a month ago from los angeles. so after a 2 hr wait and it rained.....we were seated and for $4 we get a teeny cup of oj fresh squeezed i might add. we get the waffles with potatoes and thick bacon. it was ok but not worth the wait w/ kids! i didnt tip her becuz she just acted snippy. but we spent $47 so oh well. she comes running out the store like we stole something! was everything ok? (loud as ever) nevermind its a crowd waiting oiutside..she says rather loud...u didnt tip my server i said lady get out of my face u actlike i didnt pay the bill. its gratuity and there was no gratitude. i said your millionares after that show ...damn b&^%$# i will never go back. i also disputed the charge becuz she has the nerve to add 4 dollars in the tip line that i presigned. sheesh!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this place is that it's a victim of it's own success. My husband and I used to frequent all the time, but now that it's become so popular, we refuse to wait an hour for brunch, even on the weekdays. If you do decide to wait it out, the food is amazing, and the home fries are worth the wait alone. Very friendly wait staff, and cute place, albeit very small..\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food and coffee were excellent. I got the breakfast sandwich, which was better than my husband's pork chop. The menu was a little ho hum, but I still would go back in a heart beat. The potatoes were very tasty. Get there early, we waited about 20 minutes or so.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not quite sure anyone could do breakfast any better. \n\nWe came on a Tuesday at about 9am, after previous attempts, and were seated right away. It is definately small and there is no place to wait inside, just multiple benches outside to bask in the blaring sun. If this is the case, bring sunscreen.\n\nThere is a pad of paper, just outside the door, to write your name and total number in party down -- that is known as the wait list.\n\nDon't even try to go on a weekend, atleast in my experience.\n\nAnyway, we both ordered the \"hog and chick\" - it was fabulous. Although they could have cooked the eggs a bit more. The bacon was thick cut and peppered, the has browns were real potatos, the toast was also really thick cut with real butter and local preserves.\n\nThe wait staff do not hover, the owner goes around making sure everyone is doing well. It's very heart warming being here.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended by a friend. Don't let first impression fool you. Very small. Air conditiones. Street parking. Service was phenomenal. Food was great. Ate the daily special omelette (3 eggs, turkey sausage, peppers) with tortilla and hash browns. Very good. Will definitely return next time I'm in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday happens to be the first day of my Thanksgiving break, so I figured I should hit up a breakfast or lunch place that I wouldn't normally get to go to.  I read up on some of the reviews here and felt a bit unsure, as there are lots of negative ones but decided that I trust David SB, Mr. K and Pierre much more than all the naysayers.  I'm glad I did.\n\nI also, for some unexplainable reason, did not think there would be such a long wait on a random Wednesday morning.  I mean, don't people have jobs?  We ended up waiting about a half hour, which wouldn't have been bad but it also happens to be one of five days that it rains in Phoenix.  The wait was long, and both Nathan S. and I were getting close to regretting our decision.  There was great people watching though- a man running into The Coronado Hotel (that boasts an RCA electronic system and refrigeration) with a case of Natty Light, many people rushing out of Matt's to save their car from the meter police and just generally, the meter police vehicle.\n\nWe were seating and immediately served coffee which I don't usually drink.  Nathan S. assured me that this is not the kind of place with french vanilla creamer, which is sad for me, but overall a good thing and compliment to Matt's taste.\n\nI ordered the griddle cakes and a side of hash browns.  Our food arrived at different times which wasn't cool but I figure that kitchen is tiny.  It didn't take too long for his to arrive, so we just had to wait a few minutes to dig in.\n\nOne word- BUTTERTASTIC!  I am not a breakfast girl, and I attempt to eat healthy (mostly to offset the booze intake) but this was amazing.  I knew it was a very naughty breakfast, but delicious all the same.  Nathan S. also commented that the mushrooms in his omelet had definitely been marinated in butter prior to being put into the omelet, which made me like this place more.\n\nIf you are into naughty breakfasts, Matt's is your kind of place.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways worth the wait. Their food is consistently delicious and the staff is fun and friendly. \n\nI highly recommend ordering the bacon- it is the best bacon I've ever had- thick and crispy. \n\nLove it!\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on service, cuisine and originality alone I would back Matt up in a knife fight any day.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell going against the grain for sure but, this is one really over-rated joint. Not even worth the wait. I came here like at least 8 others that were waiting out front because we saw Matt's on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on TV so it was one of those \"Hey that my town, We gotta go!\"\nI ordered one of the plates I saw on the show, the Chop and Chick, a large succulent boneless pork chop, 3 perfectly cooked eggs, nice crispy brown hash browns, thick hand sliced toast, \nWhats not to like right,?\nWell waiting on the sidewalk out front at Matt's for 1.5hrs to finally get into Breakfast Nirvana, order up and here you go \n1 thin 25% bone pork chop over cooked and dry. Ever compare a Big Mac in an ad to the one you get in a box and you'll see my point here.\n3 eggs still slimy and runny, medium eggs means medium\n1 huge helping of hash browns that I could have cooked the next 6 orders of eggs with the grease they wallowed in.\nSourdough Toast, 4 stars perfect, excellent.\nSo not all bad, just way over rated, and the following day a really great breakfast at a real local spot Big Daddy's up on Cave Creek Rd and Peoria, excellent in every way and we had never been there for breakfast before but we will be back, Matt's not a chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth the 30 minute wait in 105 deg Phoenix!!  Everything is fabulous!\nHad the bacon & eggs (Hog & Chick)...absolutely best bacon & eggs I've ever had.  High quality food and I'm not even a breakfast person.  Griddle cakes were fluffy and delicious.  Homemade bread for their toast and fresh farmers market cherry jam for spread.\n\n\n\n\n\nNum num num its Bacon. Great breakfast. I had the waffle with Bacon and sausage. I saw this place on DDD and had to make the trip.  It was really busy and they do not have a lot of seating so be prepared to wait 15 - 20 mins on the weekend.  It doesn't sound like much but I went there early and hungry.\n\nA must for Breakfast when you are in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's is DELICIOUS. Yes there is a wait but it's so worth it. Best waffle I've ever had!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is such a cool little place, just about hidden in a little building in a crappy part of downtown Phoenix. It is one of those tiny little diners, with GREAT food. I am so happy one of my co-workers convinced me to try it out. Expect a wait if you go during peak hours. The simplicity of the menu, and the great food it worth the wait though.\n\nNot sure why some of you had such a bad experience... Maybe it's because you went in the summer, I would venture to say that any place that small and that busy would suck in the heat.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered the famous \"Butter Burger\" medium rare. Forget lettuce, tomato, and pickle, eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through. Delicious! Great diner atmosphere, got to sit at the counter.\n\nHappy to see it was Niman Ranch beef, a sustainable/organic livestock provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously good stuff here.  Yes, the lines are long but that's not really their fault.  The food is great and people want to come here.\n\nThe waffle here is simply the best.  I've never had better, anywhere.  I've also had the burger, which was really, really, really good.  Next time I'll see if they can put a different cheese on it because I'm not a big fan of American cheese.  Regardless, everything here was delicious, regardless of the line.  If you're willing to wait, or maybe come at an off-hour, it's definitely worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had high expectations after seeing them on Diner's Drive Ins and Drives, and they were exceeded!  We went at around 10:30am on a Wednesday and there was about a 30 minute wait.\n\nIt was myself, my wife, and our two kids (3 and 5).  We had a waffle, griddle cakes, and the 'Hog and Chick'.\n\nThe waffle was amazing, it went quick between the kids and my wife.  The griddle cakes were good as well, and didn't last much longer.\n\nI had the Hog and Chick with sausage patties, hash browns and wheat toast.  The sausage was great, most likely from the Pork Shop (as well as the bacon), the eggs were pefect, and the hash browns were very good as well.  Even the toast was excellent and came with local strawberry preserves.\n\nI can't wait to go back.  Once we got inside, the service was very good and quick.  We were in and out in just about an hour total, half of which was waiting outside.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant is hard to describe.  The restaurant itself and the menu are really simple, breakfast staples, but they are done so well that they taste better! All ingredients are local and organic.   I always try to do the \"special\", which is usually a type of scramble.  Always delicious!  There are only about 7 tables in the whole place, so I left off a star for the wait you will see on the weekends.  However, it is 100% worth the wait!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood breakfast. Be prepared for a wait list. Also limited parking, so you may need some coin for a parking meter down the street. Very small interior, don't bring a group. Gotta try Matt's Big Breakfast at least once.\n\n\n\n\n\ni know the real secret to Matt's Wu-tang Style. \n\nsome people may think Matt's is over rated. but i know that to be false. Matt's is THE BEST BREAKFAST...period. there has not been a single time i was unhappy with the service, price, or wait. \ni would wait an hour, heck two hours if need be. \n\nthe 5-spot is by far my favorite breakfast item. its like a full on taste cell orgy. with over 50 taste cells per taste bud and a human tongue containing several million taste buds you have to figure that is alot of ecstasy in your mouth. \n\nif i could justify the time spent waiting as a business expense i would be there every morning. \n\nMatt and Erenia have a great thing going here.\n\n\n\n\n\nSooooo overrated.  I've been here three times now and this last time will be my last.  I don't mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it, but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate, coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny's fare and just a hair above their quality....well, just go to Denny's.  I haven't been to Denny's in ten years; it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt's Big Breakfast.  Not a fan of greasy food.\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably the best breakfast I've had. Long wait, over an hour on a sunday but all was amazing. Saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it still impressed.\n\nGot the prime flank steak with over easy eggs, sourdough, hashbrowns, and coffee.\n\nFlank steak was fat, juicy, and had a great pink to it. Kind of tough crust but definately impressive for a breakfast place. Eggs were good and cooked good too. Homeade blueberry preserves were amazing and I put them on everything. Bread was nice but the best was the hashbrowns. Best hashbrowns I have had to date. Crispy outside but so soft and buttery inside. Flawless texture and flavor. You MUST try these, you won't regret it. Waiter said to try cheddar cheese on them the next time and I will definately be back and can't wait to try it. \n\nDefinately best breakfast and you have to go here if your in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really enjoyed this place when I went a few weeks ago.  I hear that there is usually a long wait to get in, when I went I was lucky enough to only wait about 5 minutes before there was a table ready for us, but then again I went at 11 am on a Tuesday so I think that helped a bit.  \n\nI went on the advice of a family member.  What I wish had been mentioned was the process of how you put your name in for a table.  There is a notebook outside the front door where you write your name and the number of people in your party on.  \n\nThe coffee i had was AMAZING, and it set high expectations for the meal which were definitely met.  I had a special for that day (egg scramble with artichoke chicken sausage and gruyere cheese I believe) with sourdough toast and a side of the homefries.  I would eat this meal again in a heartbeat.  Everything was incredibly fresh down to the homemade strawberry jam.  \n\nThis is a place I definitely want to go back to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the aboslute BEST breakfast I have ever had. Every single ingredient is so fresh and tasty. I ordered a cheese omlet with a side of pancakes. My sis and I shared it. We also got orange juice and coffee. We were in heaven! We did not have 1 single complaint. From the service to cleanliness to the food it was a 10!! If you are looking for a delicious breakfast experience THIS IS THE PLACE!! \n\nI plan on going back asap!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo my hubby and I found ourselves in this area and the first place on my yelp search is this one... and we may had not paid much attention to it, but it sounded like a place a friend had just mentioned a few days back so we decided to try it...\nYou know those little things that set a place apart from the others? this one is full of those! the tap water tastes good, the glasses are quaint and beautiful. The home potatoes had tasty herbs, I ordered eggs and pork chop and the pork chop seemed to have something like pesto. The Wheat bread was better than I ever had, and instead of jelly, real blueberries... I could go on and on. Yes, the place is tiny, and perhaps a little pricey, but I think it is worth it. Service was great too. And since we were there at the right time, we didn't have to wait to be seated, neither had trouble parking. Good luck and enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wait can be a bit extreme at time but if you bring a friend to talk to it helps the time pass.  However, I wouldn't recommend waiting out there in the heat if it's 100+ outside that's for sure.  As for the food, the pesto pork chops and rosemary potatoes will satisfy any man's appetite.  In general, the handful of times I have been there never disappointing but I also have never been blown out of the water either.  I will still keep going back though.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were 50/50 on this one. I hated my meal the salami scrambled, but Christina enjoyed her St Louis special.  If I went back would stick w/ the waffle. Very small place cant say I would wait an hour to eat here.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy mom took me here this morning after I arrived on an early-morning flight, we had a craving for coffee and a new place. \nFirst impression: Small brick building by what looks like a roach motel and a parking lot totally full. Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..?\nInside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way.\nThe coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table. \n\nThe menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching. \n\nThe jist? Small cafe, great waitstaff, subpar diner food. Oh, and this might be good to know: there is no restroom in the place, so if you need to use one, you will have to go next door to that sketchy motel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was featured in Food Network and since I was in town, I thought I'll give it a try.  I got there around 12pm (rush hour) and waited 45 minutes for a table.  The staff was very friendly and helpful but super busy.  \n\nCoffee was your typical coffee, nothing special there.  The salami scramble was to die for, the flavor was amazing!  The waffles were awesome, so fluffy and soft.  The bacon was thick but it was too burnt for my preference.  The fresh jam on the thick white toast was delicious!  \n\nOverall, the food was excellent and it was worth the 45 minutes wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, every time I got to Matt's, I tell myself that is the last time I will got there. I hate the long wait. And I hate the feeling of being rushed through my weekend breakfast because they are more interested in turning over tables than me having a good dining experience.\n\nBut the food keeps me coming back. It is consistently good. They always prepare my food exactly how I request it. And I never leave a crumb to waste, which isn't usually the case.\n\nSa, as much as I hate to say it, Matt's is worth the wait. And I'll be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been coming here for a few years now and it is like coming home. I am greeted by name and the food is always great. The owners use local farm ingredients and I feel good supporting local people instead of a nameless, faceless chain restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Dad has been wanting to try this place since he saw it on the Food Network. Well, now that he's in town, he got his chance. \n\nIt's a great little place to get breakfast. And by little, I mean very little. Matt's is tiny. We went on Tuesday morning, at 10am, and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. The first thing that opened up was at the counter. If you go on Saturday or Sunday, good luck. \n\nHaving said that, everything else about Matt's is great. I had some great griddle cakes there. I didn't even have to order a side, those three pancakes filled me up for hours! My dad had the special, which was eggs, sausage, fontina cheese, and potatoes and toast. My mom had an egg and bacon and cheese Breakfast sandwich. No complaints across the board. \n\nThe staff does a great job in the small, crowded environment. Each server seamlessly tag teams you during your meal. One person took our order, another gave us our drinks, another our food, and another handled the bill. Somehow they're perfectly organized in what appears to be total chaos! \n\nI'd recommend checking Matt's Big Breakfast out sometime!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of a good reason to not judge first appearance. When my friends took me for brunch to Matt's Big Breakfast, I'm questioning her option, but since we were near this place, I agreed to try this place out. I ordered The Chick and The Chop, they gave option of eggs and I choose my fav scramble eggs. Fries or hashbrown, I choose the fries. And last time to choose my bread. Whole wheat it is! My best option for breakfast drink is always OJ so I ordered one. The OJ came, freshly pure orange juice served in a small cute cup with chicken logos. It was superb! Although the cup is small and I swore I can chug the OJ in 3secs but it still worth it! The porkchop was excellent! My whole wheat bread was thick and tasty! My scrambled eggs and fries were perfect! And last but not least, the additional bacon that I ordered was great! The only complaint that I have for this place is just the service. My waitress was too busy talking with 2 college guys customer that over-flirt her so she forgot we already gave her our card and wait for almost 45 minutes just to finish the payment. Overall, I will definitely be back for my superb breakfast but hopefully I will get a fast service next time ;))\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this restaurant I am evaluating wait time to how much I enjoyed my breakfast. Don't get me wrong the breakfast was very good and the quality of the ingredients was superb. But the wait makes me give this 3 and not 4 stars. I recommend going early like as soon as they open or do as we did. Get your name on the list, walk across the street to the Public Market/Royal Coffee shop and get your coffee there, then leisurely walk back to wait. Warning-No outside food or drink is allowed inside so be sure to finish your drink or bottle of water before entering. \nI had the ham and eggs with hashbrowns and sourdough toast. Mmmmm it was all very good. The hashbrowns were super crispy but also rather oily. The bread and fresh preserves, we had to make room for them since the full breakfast portions are large. My friend had an omelet with provolone and the walnut raisin cranberry bread and he raved about it. My other friend had the special that day which was a large omelet and a locally made andoullie sausage however he had the home fries instead of the hashbrowns. The home-fries are large potato pieces seasoned with rosemary. He enjoyed them but wished he had the hashbrowns instead. We all tried each others plates and in the end they were all jealous of my Ham, a nice thick piece of bone in ham. \nAgain the quality of the food and the products served is worthy of a 4 but with the wait...a 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n9/17\nOrdered the Hog and Chick http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=_ShdJVYIdwQmO9lphWSrCg#_ShdJVYIdwQmO9lphWSrCg- \"two eggs and a skillet-seared pork chop.\"  All entrees come with toast and your choice of hash browns or homefries.  I chose whole grain toast and the fantastic hash browns.  Had the eggs to-go, so I concentrated on the pork chop, hash browns, and whole-grain seeded toast (perfect w/ honey, but I did try the plum jam they had that day- it's OK).  Thank goodness the buttery hash browns are superb here http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=DaY5piSTeuTfbb5a7LYlIg#DaY5piSTeuTfbb5a7LYlIg (crispy on the outside and very creamy on the inside- everytime!), bec. the pork chop, even w/ the green-hued marinade still evident on it, had almost no flavor.  It had the texture of pork chop, but other than a very slight hint of salt- the hash browns and toast w/ honey had more to offer in the taste department.  I may just have to order sides of hash browns, toast, and perhaps some bacon (Nueske's, isn't it?) next time I dine in.\n\n\n\n\n\nOoh, I can help push Matt's to past 100 reviews! \n\nBefore, I only got stuff by takeout because the wait was just too much. This morning, decided to just suck it up. The fact that the downtown farmer's market is right across the street helps. I recommend signing the wait list before you're actually hungry and go check out all the local vendors.\n\nI previously had the hog and chick with \"off-the-bone ham.\" Mmmm....the ham is always flavorful and just the right amount of tender. I love how the toast is actually hunks of sourdough or wheat rolls with jam that's not a little Smuckers packet. Back to what I ate this trip, I finally had their Belgian style waffle. It was bordering on perfect--crispy in all the right places and steaming and soft inside. I love how they serve the syrup warm. The bacon was thick but not too dense. And the freshly squeezed orange juice of course complemented it all. Hard to believe that they don't add any sugar to the juice. I like how the hash browns aren't greasy like what you'd get at IHOP or Denny's. \n\nThe staff are quite friendly and make sure you've been attended to. The atmosphere in the little red brick house is a jovial neighborhood diner feel. Our wait was not quite half an hour but that's after we returned from the farmer's market to check on our wait. Time it all before you're actually starving and you'll be good.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing place!!!   I love breakfast places and have been to many great ones all over the USA, but I think this is the best one I have visited.\nWhile staying Sheraton a couple blocks away, for a work trip, I woke up early to be at the front door at the 6:30am opening.\n\n-Great food (large portions and fresh ingredients)\n-Best bacon I have ever had\n-Friendly Staff and excellent service\n-Small venue\n-Long wait if you don't arrive early (If you come solo wait is much shorter)\n\nIf I ever get back to Phoenix I will be go straight to Matt's!\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch incredible breakfast! It loses one star because of the waiting time, expect to wait an hour, but the farmers market is across the street on Saturday so just tell them you'll be there when you put in your name and problem solved! Pancakes are huge and delicious and everything else is up to par :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)\n\nMatt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.\n\nI highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever\n\nI could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!\n\n\n\n\n\nso the quest is finally over.\n\ni have found my hangover breakfast spot.\n\nalthough not hungover on this occasion, i believe that matt's will fit the bill for my greasy big breakfast need after a long night.\n\ncame in around 11am, because i can never seem to make it up before 10, and there was no wait and we were greeted and seated right away. started with a coffee which was SO good, some of the best diner/breakfast coffee i have ever had. i went with the salami and egg scramble with hashbrowns and sourdough toast, and my friend went with the chick and hog with bacon and home fries. the food came up pretty fast and i dug in.\n\nfantastic.\n\nthe eggs were cooked perfectly and the salami was out of this world. the hashbrowns were a little greasy but i mixed everything together and it balanced out. a little tabasco sauce, and i had one bomb breakfast. i tried my friends bacon and it was phenomenal. crispy, thick, and peppery. delicious. their oj is like drinking straight out of an orange. the toast was great, and their jam was just the right amount of sweet. their portions are HUGE, i couldn't even finish my breakfast. my friend was as impressed as i was. it wasn't overwhelming loud inside like some small joints are known to be (like over easy...) and it wasn't crammed at all, even though the place looks incredibly tiny from the outside!\n\nexcellent service, stellar food, cool atmosphere, all for only $20 plus tip. i'm jumping on the matt's bandwagon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBe prepared for a wait, and amazing food. Average service. Waitress will say \"I'll be right back with that,\" and it will never come.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery impressed w the food, just know b4 hand the wait was almost and hour long and this was on a Thursday b4 noon. I can see why people will wait. The downfall is that now when I have breakfast, the first thing that I think is \"matts, is the best breakfast place I have ever been too\" :p \n\nCan't wait to be back!\n\nPs Guy from dives and diners was there! :D\n\n\n\n\n\nNice breakfast. Another 30 minute wait for food, but I thought it was pretty worth it.\n\nTheir special for the day was a three egg scramble with chicken artichoke sausage, organic baby spinach and mozzarella cheese. Very unique and executed quite well - loved the sausage and the freshness of the spinach.\n\nThe hash browns were a litte strange (like what would happen if you pressed a potato through a spaghetti-making pasta machine) but nice and  crunchy on the outside.\n\nMy wife got the ham and eggs. These were also good, with nicely salted ham.\n\nWe also had a side of bacon, which was well peppered and cooked almost to a crisp.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, this is absolutely the most average place i've ever eaten breakfast.  Not much different than national chains.  Way overrated.  Do not go out of your way to eat here, you'll do just as well at a large chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nBig. Big might be a bit of an understatement when describing this place. The portions are HUGE. I ordered the 3 egg omelette with salami, which also came with hash browns and toast. The 3 eggs was more like 4. Half the plate was eggs/salami, the other half was hash browns. Then she brought the toast out, with a homemade jam. Then I had the nerve to order a side of bacon. \n*sidenote* the bacon was 3 thick strips sprinkled in pepper. When I bit into that first piece, the amalgamation of pepper, maple and succulent pig meat did a slow sensual tango with my tongue. I immediately looked around to see if anyone else was having this same experience. Yes. I was not the only one. Bacon. Get it. *end sidenote*\nThere was so much food I had to map out a quick strategy. Started with the bacon. (BACON. GET IT) then dove into the eggs which was very good. The hash browns were on point, and the jam was very good. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give me a 5 is because of the wait. This is a popular spot, so be prepared to wait about 45 min. The place isn't that big, so we waited out front for just about 45. The wait was def worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely worth the wait if you're a breakfast person. The hash browns were amazing. I hope to go back again very soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nyummy yummy.  I love Matt's big breakfast, and return frequently.  I never mind the wait the staff is amazing and courteous.  The food is fresh and delicious and rotating specials allow you to try different things from their menu.  I am a huge fan :)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore like matt's small breakfast!\n\nThe big name and high prices were certainly not reflected in the portion sizes. That being said, the portions were more than enough for me and I left with a full tummy. Some of the ingredients were organic and local (yay!!), but the actual food was nothing special. In fact, the raspberry preserves were the most impressive thing I ate at matt's. I feel like I could have cooked everything there (and probably more to my liking) with the ingredients in my refrigerator and saved a chunk of change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wait was REALLY long, but we were prepared by the other reviews. I like that you give your order before you go in so you get your food right away. However, the food is only a step above other, more convenient places. I'm over it.\n\n\n\n\n\nif you don't like bacon, i would skip matt's, but if you like bacon, you should go every day. there is no bacon like the bacon at matt's. i have a friend who rants about this at least once a week. i'm certain this is the only meat product this vegetarian misses.\n\ni haven't really tried a lot of things on the menu. i'm a big fan of the specials and the 5 spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the best breakfast joint in the valley of the sun.   I have been here many times and the average wait time is about an hour.... but is totally worth it!\n\nFood:  The food here is great!  Everything is freshly made and full of favor!  My favorite is their pork chop with eggs... and you must get their rosemary home fries and wheat toast!   Also thick cut bacon as a side!  The bacon is what keeps bringing me back to this place.   They are thick cut and peppered... 3 slices for $2.95 might be a little pricy but they are really good!  \n\nTheir daily specials are also very good, most of the time is some type of egg/ sausage scramble.\n\nI also love their homemade bread and jam.  Matt's switches up their jam favors.\n\nService:  Their staff is great!  Very friendly and attentive.  But you must prepare to wait... the only time that I didn't have to wait was when I got there 10 mins before opening.   Otherwise prepare to wait at least 1 hour.   They new location is more than twice the size of the old location, but wait time is still very long, especially you have a large group.\n\n\n\n\n\nWowie!! Try the Rueben it's too die for . Thick slabs of pastrami , cheese and a delicious rye bread.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe menu is pretty lameski if you don't go in for a lot of meat.  Here's my problem with Matt's: if you order the cheese omelet and have their paltry selection of veggies added to it, you're paying more than you would for a meat omelet.  That's pretty stupid; meat costs more than vegetables, and is a bigger deal to store and prep.  How hard is it to offer a reasonable vegetarian option?  \n\nI've eaten there twice for breakfast and lunch, and quality each time was middling.  The hashbrowns were not good, really slimy and squishy on the inside.  \n\nNot worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere with friends. 1:10 wait, YES the new bigger place. But worth the wait. Pancakes Excellent, Omlette fantastic!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place under-promised and over-delivered. It was a definite whole in the wall feeling, and I'm assuming you should be prepared to wait should you go at peak hours. We went on a Friday morning and had around a 20 minute wait. The food was so fresh and the pancakes were absolutely delicious. They really up the ante on diner fare and go fresh and local. The difference is in the taste. Even the sourdough toast was homemade. Well done...and at a great price.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, I think I was a dick the first time I wrote a review of Matt's, so i'll try again.\n\nI don't like lines.  No, I mean I really don't like lines and I have horrible Disney World nightmares that sometimes wake me up.  Despite my hatred of lines, I love Matt's and I dream of Matt's, too, and sometimes I even find myself in line at Matt's in the blazing heat, waiting for those wonderful pancakes and floating like Bugs Bunny to a carrot.  I think I said something silly in my last review, like, \"I won't go back for months because of the lines,\" but I was back and I felt guilty, so I'm rewriting the review to assuage my guilt and allow me a future guilt-free experience as I devour their pancakes.\n\nI wasn't kidding about the scooter gang, though.  Seriously, there was a scooter gang in line.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting Phoenix and I wanted to revisit Matt's.  I was here two years ago and I had heard that they moved, 4 months ago, to a new larger space.   \n\nThe new space is nice, but I somehow miss the tiny old one.  The little place was unique and atmospheric where the new place is cool, but somehow generic-cool.  \n\nStaff was nice enough, but it put me off a bit when they wanted $1.50 for more maple syrup.   I said OK because the pancakes were SUPER DRY.   Not good at all.   And the maple syrup is totally sub par.  Tastes like Aunt Jemima.  It's stored in big plastic jugs in the dining room.   \n\nFriend's omelette was overcooked and greasy.   Potatoes were just average.   Thick cut marble rye toast was good, but then he loves anything rye.\n\nCome on Matt, you can do better.   Spend more time training your kitchen staff.  And does your wife always wear UGGs, no matter the weather?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'd always wanted to try this place out, especially after it gained fame on The Travel Channel. It's a literal hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix that's known for fabulous breakfast and endless waits. \n\n\"Matt's Big Breakfast on N. First St. is a popular diner that serves heaping plates of Chop and Chick (pork chops and eggs). A local favorite, the small dining room fills up fast causing a line of early birds to pour out onto the street.\" - the Travel Channel\n\nEverything about this place could be described as, well, cute. The yellow door, tiny juice glasses with roosters on them, vintage art on the walls, even the waitress aprons. \n\nMy bf ordered the special; a concoction of eggs, hashbrowns and Andouille sausage in a hearty sauce. I opted for the waffle that came with A. the best butter I've ever had and B. some bacon. \n\nThe service was lightening fast once we were seated and the food was tasty. My waffle was by far the winner of our two entrees.\n\nWould I wait an hour to eat here again? Doubtful. Am I glad I got to experience it? Very.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA buddy of mine invited me to breakfast. Payment for fixing his computer. We meet on location and as I pull up, my friend is sitting outside and signals me to park around the back. The back parking lot was full, so I parked on 1 street, having to feed the meter. As I walk up I notice people outside waiting, so I sit on the bench next to my buddy out front for about three minutes when one of the girls calls us, we're next. The place is small and the atmosphere is loud because of the small space, but hey, this is downtown phoenix, who cares. I ordered the triple stack pancakes with a side of sunny side up eggs and a order of bacon. My buddy ordered the Pork Chop breakfast with potatoes. The food was great, all home made. The only thing that bothered me was there was no reg sugar, just brown. Next time I will have to bring my own sweet and low for the coffee. Girls are cute, service was great. I would definitely be coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\nstopped in again last sunday before picking someone up at the airport. breakfast was flawless (again). i had the hog and chick this time and was very happy. hashbrowns were crispy, but not burnt. eggs were scrambled and fluffy. the jam of the day was strawberry, and some of the best i have ever had. love me some sourdough toast & jam. i waited less than 5 minutes ( it was only me), sat at the bar, and enjoyed swift, friendly service. coffee was fine but not great. if matt's is going to improve, i say the coffee is where to start.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was in phoenix on business and im allways looking for some good eats , I found this place with the help of yelp and food network app on my i phone . \nI originally planned on getting the waffle that everyone raved about , but ended up getting the Special Andouille sausage scramble ( spicy!) but very good . Hash Browns were good and i also liked the sour dough toast . \nWhen i go back im definatly gonna try the waffle \nBe ready to wait for a seat , it doesnt seem very big . \nSingles get seated faster because they have counter style seating\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as I found out I would be traveling to Phoenix, I began looking up places to eat. Matt's Big Breakfast was the first thing to crank up my Yelpdar!\n\nB R I E F  S U M M A R Y\n-- Probably the most reviewed/well known place in downtown Phoenix\n-- Featured on TV like everyone else said\n-- This newer location is a block further than the old (way bigger now!)\n-- Warm & welcoming ambience\n-- Friendly and attentive staff (seems like they have a system)\n-- I recommend coming early, only 6 tables @ 6:45am (Wed morning)\n-- Salami scramble was definitely unique but needed some cheese\n-- Potatoes had decent flavor (rosemary) but I wish I got hash browns\n-- Waffle was hot & fresh & syrup was high quality\n-- Sourdough toast was thick & good\n-- Strawberry preserves were delicious!\n-- The regular menu is very limited\n-- Staff recommends trying the specials\n-- Very sad I couldn't try the french toast, it's ONLY a special! :(\n\nWell I woke up super early because I didn't want to get stuck here and I had a meeting at 8am! I forgot that AZ is an hour ahead of CA. I woke up so tired and barely made it here at 6:45am. I walked from the Westin which was a healthy walk at 6 in the morning! I was a bit disappointed to find the old location but luckily I saw the new location was only a block further.\n\nI really like the feel and ambience of Matt's Big Breakfast (MBB). The wait staff were all ladies and they were all very friendly and attentive even at 6am! I was barely awake and I wasn't sure if I was going to come here again so I ended up ordering basically 2 dishes so I could try 2 things. My server loves the waffle so I had to get it. The special she also recommended but I'm just not a fan of apple sausage so I opted for the salami scramble. \n\nI'm from the San Francisco bay area so I'm almost accustomed to what MBB is doing with fresh, local ingredients. I applaud them for keeping their food quality so high but I wasn't uberly impressed because I'm sort of used to it. I expect to pay a decent amount of money for high quality food. I didn't feel like MBB was overpriced, I thought the prices were about right in my opinion.\n\nThe waffle was above average and I could taste the quality of the syrup. I really wanted the french toast but it wasn't being offered. To me, if you're famous for french toast, you should offer it on your menu! Nevertheless, the waffle is a good alternative. \n\nThe salami scramble was so unique and different. I've never had anything quite like it but I really wish they would have added some creamy cheese to smooth out the salami after taste. I think I added some ketchup or hot sauce to my potatoes and it helped balance the salami. If you like salami, I recommend. I probably wouldn't order again, I just was feeling adventurous. I was a bit surprised that the sourdough bread was so thick but it was still good. The preserves really enabled me to eat all of it otherwise it would been just too much bread for me.\n\nClearly this place is living up to the hype as it is the number 1 rated place in downtown Phoenix. I didn't search further than that because I didn't have a rental car or anything. I would definitely recommend coming here and if I'm ever out here again, I hope that I can grab some of their french toast!\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty darn good! I hate waiting in line to get into restaurants, but Matt's is actually worth the wait. I would have given them 5 stars, but I have to give one star to the Farmer's Market a block away that made the wait fun and enjoyable. Support local farmers AND support your belly.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to Matt's BB for the first time last weekend.  Took me a moment to get oriented - it's not immediately obvious if you present yourself inside to get on a list or not.  The answer: not.  You sign yourself in.  Once we had that figured out, we waited - but not for as long as I thought.  They certainly have an efficient little operation.  The staff brought out menus for any large parties so the kitchen could start in on their order before they were seated.\n\nOnce inside, we were greeted warmly and had our orders taken promptly.  My wife tried the special - an odd scramble of eggs, spinach and chicken sauage.  She got hers with hashbrowns and some really nice, thick, fibrous toast.  I had a few bites of her toast and was frankly tempted to order some for myself.  I thought the hashbrowns were OK, but I am not crazy about hashbrowns.\n\nI ended up with a bowl of their steel-cut oatmeal, which came with raisins and brown sugar (and milk), then got a side of the homefries.  Sure glad I ordered that side - they were the highlight of the meal.  Perfectly cooked, with nice big chunks of potato, slightly blackened, with fresh rosemary.  Now, I am not always enthusiastic about rosemary.  Can be too strong.  But they'd added the perfect amount.  \n\nI commented to my wife that I could see coming there and having a couple orders of their homefries as my meal - they were that satisfying.  \n\nThe oatmeal was also very tasty.  I wasn't going to bother with it until I saw it was steel-cut.  It was my first time having steel-cut oatmeal at a restaurant, and I enjoyed the contrast to the typical restaurant oatmeal. \n\nSomeone at the next table ordered the pancakes, and they looked fantastic. \n\nService was very attentive and efficient.  We'll definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverrated, overrated, overrated.\n\nThe food was OK, the service sucked, they don't have ranch dressing, and they don't  have any restrooms on site... which is unacceptable in my opinion.\n\nAfter waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside, I had high hopes. My over easy eggs were soupy, more like under easy, nasty, and the guy next to me complained hes eggs were soupy as well. Something as simple as eggs should be cooked to perfection if this place was so good. The bacon and ham were pretty good, but nothing extra ordinary. The hash browns were soaked in butter and cooked with some short of pepper mix that tasted like crap. The pancakes were just pancakes with maple syrup, tasted exactly like pancakes from crackle barrel, whatever. The only thing at this place I can honestly say was the best I've ever had was the whole wheat toast. \n\nThe food was ok. If their wasn't a wait it would be worth eating at, but other then that, places like Chompies and The Breakfast Club are far superior.\n\n\n\n\n\nMet friends for breakfast this morning and was sadly disappointed.  I expected the 30 minute wait, but did not expect the over cooked eggs.  Now I did ask for crispy bacon and crispy hashbrowns and neither came out that way.  Maybe it was just a bad day, but I do not expect I will go back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously, Matt's cooks up some of the best breakfast food I have ever had. I've been going here for three years or so, and I have never been disappointed. I've never waited much more than 30 minutes, but that's probably because I never go on weekends after 8:30 AM and never at lunch time on weekdays. \n\nTheir eggs benedict is hands down the best I have ever had. It's a special, so you have to be lucky to get it. Before I ever had their eggs benedict (the first was actually a sausage benedict with their AMAZING sausage), i had never really been a fan. But their benedict sparked such a deep love that whenever I've been in a restaurant that serves benedict, I always get it, but it never measures up. Their fresh hollandaise, perfectly poached egg, delicious ham and wonderful english muffin... just cannot be beat. And then you have their oh-so-buttery hash browns that I crave on a regular basis. I used to have a problem deciding between their also awesome homefries roasted perfectly with rosemary, but now I can't resist the hash browns. Also, their bacon is absolutely heavenly, and I'm not really a huge fan of bacon, so I always end up ordering a side of it. The omelets and pancakes are also always perfectly fluffy and delicious, and I've never found their portions to be remotely small. I always leave completely fat and happy. My only complaint that I can think of is that their delicious orange juice comes in an insanely small portion, but their delicious honey lemonade makes up for it.\n\nThis is always on my list of restaurants I absolutely have to go to when I'm home from college.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a simple breakfast menu and yet the food taste nowhere near simple! There was just something about the food that made it one of the best breakfasts I have ever had!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you treat breakfast like dessert or like bbq, this is the place to start your day.  I recommend the ridiculous waffle or the salami scramble. What I am talking about... order both, you deserve it!\n\n\n\n\n\ni have tried three times on weekends to get in here, usually not in top form, i may have thrown up the parking lot once...sorry.\nbut on a sunny thursday morning i manged to get in without much fuss.\n\nusually the fussiness is outside, oh! there is shade now jane l. this makes sense because summer is ovah...duh. so anywho...screaming tots a go go. this is a tiny place...why would you bring your spawn here? i hear tell ihop has balloon animals? maybe you could have them fashion  an anchor shaped balloon creation to match your tattoo flash inspired t-shirt? \n\nthe choices here are slim but the portions are large as well as the amount of grease. hey i like grease...but like red grease dripping out of the back end of my burrito at 4 a.m. because in the gleaming light of the morning it makes me feel so dirty. i had the oats, surprisingly grease free and my partner in breakfast crime had the cheese omelette. i also ordered home fries on the side, some have complained about the rosemary...mine had rosemary, but it looked like it was accidental. pretty bland and boring. the entire experience was pretty bland and boring. i don't see what all of the fuss is about, sure it's good, but it's also breakfast...how hard can it be?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do they do to make a basic breakfast so good? Well, actually mine wasn't basic. I took the special off the board: Andouille sausage, havarti cheese (I think), a lovely red spicy pepper three egg omelette AH-mazing, their famous potatoes on the side. Thick slices of whole grain bread on the side with a tiny bit of butter (I wish it had more). One of my kids had the breakfast sandwich with bacon, one had the chicken marinated in pesto sandwich, and the husband had something I can't remember but everyone was very full, very happy even after waiting well over an hour to get seated.  We did ask for a grilled cheese sandwich for our kid and the waitress looked at us stunned and said it's not on the menu. True but they have bread and cheese right? Oh well. What I loved more than anything was every staff person you come in contact with says: Thank you for waiting! \n\nI hope to go back soon even though it's a 40 minute drive from my house and more than likely an hour wait to get in - it's worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive all the way from Buckeye to Matt's at least once every other week. It's so worth the drive...and the wait Beware...you will have at least a 15 min. wait. But it is soooo worth it! Best Waffles I have EVER had. Bacon is as it should be, thick, crispy and MEATY! I haven't even started on the homefries...YUM! They use all fresh ingredients bought locally, even the coffe is bought from a local place, Cave Creek Coffee. They have me hooked...\n\nDo yourself a favor, come down here, order ANYTHING and enjoy! You will NOT be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERRATED.\n\nI know it was reviewed on Food network channel as top 10 something or another in the nation.  Did their quality go down since they know that people will seek it out irregardless of the review?\n\nLocation- in down town Phoenix- but in a crappy part that doesn't look safe at night.  Dirt lot in back is not an option to park because of city ordinances or safety issues.\n\nWait time- for those reviewers who waited over 1hour in the hot desert sun- i don't know what to say. There is little to no shade, it's hot, you lean on wooden fences... it's a strange system where you sign your name to be called. However, if you sign in, and say you want to go do something else instead of wait an hour in the hot sun, they will cross you off the list if you aren't there for roll call. Some people behind us, just waited a bit then walked in and sat at the bar (where they were seating other people).  And they say they don't play favorites?  Please....  If you can't stand to wait, you can  order take out and get your food before all the other people waiting.  Do they let anyone know? NO. Do they care that people waiting over 1 hour have to wait another hour for food so To-Go people can get their food? NO...\n\nFood- maybe the food tastes better because your out in the hot sun,dehydrating, standing, waiting... because the food didn't look like anything special and didn't taste special either.  Just run of the mill breakfast food.  Does it take 45min to make waffles and toast?  We told them we had a flight to catch, and our food took a crazy amount of time to make. No wonder the wait is so long outside! 2oz of OJ was $2.50\n\nAmbiance- it's a 3 room (1 kitchen, one bar set up, 1 room with 4 tables and seating on bar-like thing looking outside. Think they can seat ~20 people inside?  Poor decor, crappy furniture.... they must make a ton of money because none of it is going into the location/upkeep/decor.\n\nDon't even think about coming here with more than 6 people.... Where will you put them? Wait til the restaurant clears so you have a room to yourself?  ha...\n\nOnce again, OVER-RATED.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place. I've never had a bad meal there and the staff is wonderful. The only reason I take away one star is because I really just don't like waiting outside. But the griddlecakes and sourdough toast (complete with homemade jam) are amazing!  Hopefully I will be able to visit on a day where I won't have to wait outside for too long.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the idyllic breakfast stop for all you yelping food fanatics. Matt's is an upscale diner that will keep you believing breakfast really is the most important meal of the day; no matter how many carbs you just ate. My game plan was to order a meal and save half of it for later or even the next day; unfortunately, it was sooo good that I just couldn't stop.\n\nWhen they asked me what type of toast I wanted I half shrugged it off as just give me the \"whatever\" flavor and I won't eat it anyway. I generally stay away from generic tasting food in an effort to make my calories count for at the very least and awesome tasting meal.\n\nEven the toast was awesome! If they didn't bake the loaf of bread that my toast came from just as I was making my order, you could have foolded me. The hashbrowns were awesome, so much that I ate them all.  I wish I knew how to make my scrambled eggs taste like Matt does. You will not be dissapointed with any meal you order here.\n\nWords just don't give this breakfast joint justice, so be sure to check out all the pictures!\n\nExpect to pay about $10-11 per person after tax and tip for one of these awesome breakfast meals.\n\n**WARNING** Don't eat here if you are looking for just another breakfast place. **\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's little more to say that hasn't already been said.\n\nMatt's has very familiar items on their menu, but each that I've tried really is impressively delicious!\n\nExpect to wait...if you're impatient there are plenty of others who are willing to wait (me included) for 40+ minutes on a very empty stomach.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm biased because I can make a damn tasty breakfast myself at home, but for all the rave reviews and even being on TV, I expected this place to be a little above average.\n\nDecent food, awesome waitstaff.  Let's weigh the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n*good tasty bacon...\n*hashbrowns to die for - crunchy on the outside, creamy inside...\n*definite use of fresh ingredients...\n\nCons:\n*it felt like eating in my pantry with 25 other people...\n*all the cooks get to hear you peeing in the water closet (and I mean closet)...(maybe this is a problem only for the female persuasion?)...\n*almost $2 for a CAN of RC that probably cost them 25 cents, no free refills...\n*one egg was undercooked and one was overcooked...\n*feeling rushed to finish and get out of there as people outside stare at you wondering why you're taking so long to eat...\n\nOh and not to mention the butter burger that was ordered with blue maytag that I had to try a bite of - and ended up with a couple of tablespoons of hot boiling butter in my lap.  The maytag was yummy and fortunately I could taste it despite my scorched tongue.\n\nWe definitely left with full tummies (including my red burnt one) but more cons than pros means it was worth it to try for the first time, but I think the only item I might crave is the hashbrowns.  If I ever REALLY have to have their hashbrowns, I'll order it to go!\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered Huevos rancheros. It's pretty good. Very good service. Good food. The sandwhich looks good. Good pork chop. Weird restroom place.  There were lots of people lining up to just get into the restaurant. It's easier to get into the restaurant in singles than as in a group. FYI. Great hidden place to dine in.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was willing to wait for 1 1/2 hour  for the best breakfast I  was reading about ... boy, I was disappointed.\n\nCON:\n*Bacon was dry .. really really dry\n*Hash brown  ... burnt on the outside soggy with butter on the inside. Don't get me wrong. I love my butter .. but that was just way too much.\n*Tables are tiny - we had 3 pple and a toddler  and they put us with a table  for 2. Please explain to me how we were suppose to eat ?\n\nPRO:\n*Matt was really nice\n*Service was great\n*The sour dough bread with blueberry jam was really good.\n\nWill I go back ?  ... No.\n\n\n\n\n\nEVERYONE hyped this place up waaaaay too much. I waited with 2 friends for 1.5 hours. I got a Cheese/Sausage omelet with grilled onions... it came with a piece of toast, 2 eggs (I think), and hash browns.\n\nPeople seem to talk about the hash browns... I don't see whats so special. Shredded potato that's burnt on the top and bottom, while hella soggy in the middle... is not my idea of damn good hash browns.\n\nIn my honest opinion, if you like A LOT of butter on everything, as well as waiting in line for a hour and a half, for a chance to sit down in a crazy small restaurant... then this is the breakfast stop for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have seen the lines here on the weekends and avoid the place but I drive by during the week sometimes and notice nobody standing around so I sneak in for some food.  The specials I have tried were all very good. I love the buttery hash browns. Mmmm.. Tried a waffle and it was great also. This is one of the best breakfast resturants I have tried.\n\n\n\n\n\nI won't lie. I had been dying to try Matt's Big Breakfast ever since I saw it on DDD years ago. Since I live in NorCal, and the only reason for me to visit the Phoenix area is MLB spring training, Matt's has remained an elusive temptation, taunting me from afar. \n\nSo when I decided, after a 20 year absence, to take another trip to baseball's March mecca, I knew that a visit to Matt's was on my short \"must do\" list. I LOVE breakfast, and I am willing to wait for a good one.\n\nIt was a little intimidating to roll up and see the hoard of people waiting outside the restaurant on a Tuesday morning, but we put our name on the list and took our place amongst the throng.\n\nWe were seated after a wait of just under an hour and the waitress arrived promptly to take our order. My dining buddy and I both ordered the Hog and Chick, she with soft scrambled eggs, sausage and homefries, and I with over medium eggs, bacon and hash browns. We also decided to split a waffle. The homefried potatoes were good, but the hash browns were out of this world-- crispy on the top and bottom and soft and buttery in between. Seriously the best hash browns I've ever had. The bacon was thick and peppery, and lthough the waffle was tasty, I would have preferred it to have a crispier outside. The hand sliced whole wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam was perfect.\n\nI've been to a few places featured on Food Network, and though some of them haven't lived up to expectations, a few of them are home runs (Voula's Offshore Cafe, The Squeeze Inn, Bette's Oceanview Diner). Matt's knocks it out of the park.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place is tiny, you have to wait at list 30 minutes to the taste the most expensive small oj and very greasy breakfast! although their bacon is pretty tasty. I wish they wouldn't rush you so much.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelieve the hype, 'cause it's all true!\n\nYes, I heard about this place from the Food Network; and yes that's why I wanted to try it. Yes, the wait can be long sometimes, but it was only about 10-15 minutes today. But, you come here for the food, right? And the food is ALLLLL GOOOOOD!!!\n\nI ordered the Griddlecakes. Best pancakes I've EVER had. The were light & fluffy and fell apart in my mouth. Kind of had a rustic, homemade look to them too. Real butter and real maple syrup too. Mmmmm!\n\nMy mom ordered the burger, and gave me some. Wow, the flavor of the ground beef was probably the best I've had in a burger...ever! She didn't even need to put condiments on it. It only needed the meat, bun, & cheese to be instantly in the top 3 of my list of Favorite Burgers in the World.\n\nMy dad ordered the Hog & Chick (ham & eggs). I tried a little of his breakfast too [my family likes to share food; don't judge]. The best hashbrowns I've ever had. The ham was very delicious too. He wasn't sharing his toast, so imagine that must have been pretty tasty (?).\n\nBottom line: this place is legitimately some of THE best food in the whole Valley. Give it a try if you like, but preferably when I'm not there so I don't have to wait very long.\n\n\n\n\n\nRibeye Steak and Eggs... Best Breakfast in 15 years of traveling.  Be prepared for a bit of a wait.  Great service!\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than making this another dissertation on every detail of my restaurant experience, I'll try for once to keep it short and sweet. I came here on a Tuesday morning with my friend and my toddler, after a short wait we were seated. We both ordered the bacon and eggs with hash browns. Mine scrambled, hers sunny side up and I also got a pancake on the side for the toddler and me to share (so he wouldn't steal all of my scrambled eggs). The food came pretty quickly and everything was good. My friend said the hash browns were better seasoned last time she was there (they needed a little salt). They were actually made from honest to god, real potatoes, and when was the last time you saw that? I saw in the reviews that they have the best scrambled eggs but I wouldn't go that far. They were good. They also needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper but they were not the best. You have to go to Essence for that. The bacon was nice and thick and delicious and the raisin bread that came with my breakfast delighted my toddler. My pancake was OK. It tasted like a typical good restaurant buttermilk pancake. It did come with warm syrup though and that always makes me happy. Would I come here again? Sure! Would I wait in line on a Saturday for an hour and half? Are you f-ing kidding me?\n\n\n\n\n\nTold this was the best in town so made multiple attempts to go, but left twice because the wait was over 2 hrs... When we finally caught them on an odd morning when the wait was reasonable, found the food was good but not worth the hype.  Plus, had to ask 3 times for my side waffle, and when it was brought out she poured the syrup all over me and made only a half effort to clean it up.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single handed worst breakfast experience I've ever had. The only time I've ever waited over 50 minutes for a table before giving up. I came alone on a Saturday at 9am. I asked how long the wait would be for a party of one and the hostess(I guess you could call her that) stated that, \"they don't quote times, but that it goes fast.\" They don't write down the time you arrive so either management doesn't care how long the patrons are waiting for a table or are to dumb to look into it. I find it rude, disrespectful, and disingenuous to patrons to not quote a time on one hand while saying it goes fast on the other. They must have known that patrons were waiting close to an hour for a seat and they are hoping that we would become \"pot committed\" and hang out for the table. \n    Maybe they are hoping that you will wait so long that you get so hungry that the food will taste better. I've eaten at Matt's Big Breakfast before and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars on food quality. They aren't spectacular just good. Sadly Phoenix is deeply lacking in good breakfast joints. \n    So starving after a 50 minute wait I decided to head home and stop at McDonalds (also a one star restaurant, but at least I won't wait 50 minutes to get to place my order). While en route I drove by LO LO'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES approx. 2 miles from Matt's big (slow) breakfast and noticed that it was fairly empty at 10am. I pulled in to Lo Lo's and was pleasantly surprised to find a hidden gem for breakfast. How about that the worst breakfast experience turns into one of the best. I was immediately sat at a table(there was enough space for 8 person parties. Coffee was promptly brought and it was perfect in every respect of the word. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and I was dumbfounded why I tried to go back to Matt's Big (slow) breakfast with so many other options available.\n    Two additional points I'd like to make: first, there was a bunch of people waiting for Matt's Big (slow) Breakfast but it wasn't a constant flow of additional people coming it was the same bunch of people waiting for 50+minutes; second, YOU'VE been warned.\n    If you want to try something different/unique/and worthwhile give LO LO's Chicken and Waffles a shot at breakfast. I don't mind waiting for a table at a desirable restaurant. What I mind is a restaurant that doesn't value it's patrons enough to respect their time and to allow their patrons to make conscious decision if they want to wait or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Matts and feel everything about this place is IMPECCABLE. But unfortunately the small capacity seating and over an hour waiting in line ALWAYS turns me away.  Id be around more often if I wasn't wasting my weekends sitting on a hot bench.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had breakfast here on a trip to Phoenix and it was to die for! I got the special which was a 3-egg scramble with cheese, spinach, and ham - SO GOOD. The eggs tasted SO fresh. THE BEST PART - the HASH BROWNS. Oh my gosh, I have never tasted hash browns like that before - they were perfect! Crunchy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside - yum yum. The toast was made fresh (like my mom's), and was THE best toast I have ever had at a restaurant. Fresh squeezed OJ was dynamite! SO GOOD! Best OJ I have ever had. Even the coffee was good!! Great vibe - really small place so no wonder there is a wait. PLUS, I saw the workers give a little to-go box to one of the homeless guys on the street - LOVE THAT!! Not only does this place have great food and great service, but they are caring people!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been hearing good things about this place for so long, it was ridiculous I hadn't yet been. I'm all about supporting local business & breakfast is my favorite meal, so this past Saturday I decided to check it off my foodie bucket list. I met 2 friends at 10am. One of them had gotten there at 945 and put our name on the list for a table of 3. Almost 1 hour later, we were seated at a 2 top with an additional chair pulled up. To start, a hipster waitress wearing a huge gold watch and too many bracelets asked what we wanted to order after we had been seated for no more than 2 minutes. Menu-  I've been craving French toast all morning. Come to find they don't have French toast. \"French toast is seasonal\". Really? Waitress is back again asking what we want after an additional 2 minutes. I ordered a waffle that came with 2 pieces of bacon for $7.50. Waffle was good, served with real cream butter. They do have real maple syrup which is a plus. The bacon was thick, but peppered on the sides which I don't like. Maybe I'm greedy but I also think they should have given 3 slices for a $7.50 plate. I also ordered a cup of coffee (which admittedly I am a coffee snob). Ick.  Burned and watered down at the same time. Needing the extra caffeine, I got my coffee refilled once the cup had been empty for almost 15 mins. I actually asked a server passing by twice if they could refill it.  They never did bring the creamer I asked for (also twice) so I couldn't even drink the 2nd cup. All in all, we waited entirely too long for a crowded place whose food was nothing to write home about. Our bill was almost $50 including tip for 3 people. I recommend you skip this hipster spot that has been hyped up entirely too much. Simply doesn't meet up to expectations IMO. If I'm craving a hipster breakfast and am prepared to shell out $50 for 3 people, I will swing by Postino's for brunch on Saturday/Sunday and get a meal with fresher ingredients and much better coffee and service. Likely a shorter wait, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nYummy hidden gem in downtown Phoenix, though since Food Network has been there, the place has exploded. This is a tiny converted house and boy is it small. The inside is cute though and there are tables packed in along with a counter top bar.\n\nThe wait is long, and it is also worth it. The best days to go of course are the weekdays. Just avoid the weekend period. Local eggs, cheeses and milk. Local goods in general. The coffee was to die for! Home made jam! Thick cut delicious BACON! Do stop here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were a couple of reviews for Matt's Big Breakfast that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  Two people made the comment that \"Denny's makes a better breakfast\".  That is patently ridiculous.  The only time someone cracks open an egg at Denny's is if you order them sunny side up.  Otherwise, they pour pre-scrambled eggs (as does IHOP) from a bottle.  The other comments I've read are \"there's nothing here that can't be made at home.\"  Completely true, but that could be said of a lot of restaurants.  The whole point is going OUT to eat when you don't want to make food at home.  Frankly, some of the lesser starred reviews would be much different if not for the long waits.  Anyway, I digress...\n\nLike many, I first became aware of MBB after it was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (DDD, Triple D, 3D, etc.)  It looked good, but nothing terribly special.  Certainly not like some of the places I've seen on DDD, which leave me checking travel websites for flights.  But, I thought, \"If I'm in Phoenix, I'll give this a try.\"  \n\nSo, I'm in Phoenix and craving breakfast.  I make my way down to Matt's and while there are 6-7 people milling about outside, it's not too bad.  After waiting maybe 30 minutes (downright speedy compared to the wait endured by some other reviewers), my name is called and I enter the tiny eatery.  The menu is pretty sparse, but there are some specials so I opted for one of the items on the chalkboard: egg, spinach, mushroom, smoked gouda scramble with hash browns and toast.  While I wait for my meal, I enjoy some of the very tasty coffee.  My plate arrives, and it is a large serving of food, contradicting the reports of skimpy servings.  As a lover of hash browns, I had to try them first.  Crispy and super buttery, just as I recalled when watching DDD.  The scramble was excellent and you could tell how fresh the ingredients are.  I decided to save my toast and housemade jam as my \"dessert\", so to speak.  I think my only issue was with the hash browns.  They started off so well, but it was a large portion and at the halfway point the richness of the butter started taking its toll.  I soldiered on and finished my plate, but I seriously thought I'd have a heart attack.  Sadly, did not have room for my toast and jam.\n\nIf I ever find myself in Phoenix again, I would come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaw it on TV and had to check it out while in town. Had the waffle with bacon, all great. Wife had the salami scramble with sourdough toast. Some of the best toast I have ever had. Everything I saw looked great and the owners were both there, always a good sign. There was a wait and parking can be hard, but if you want a good breakfast in Phoenix this is the spot. Next time I am in Phoenix I will be going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat portion size- Lunch and dinner for 7.95 :)\n\nI definitely recommend Matt's. There was a wait, but it wasn't terrible- just bring a book or play 20 questions. The bacon was delicious. I had a BLT and my boyfriend had the egg sandwich. Both were great, but the egg sandwich was AWESOME. I would get that if I went again. \n\nWorth checking out, fast service once you're seated, $20 for two of us and we both had leftovers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHey this place is a classic down town breakfast joint. They sure dont need a A+ review from me, but what the hell. This Place Is Awesome.I love riding my bike to this funky little diner. I always get the breakfast special; this time it was scrambled eggs, ham, fresh jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese, with a side of home frys. Holy Sh** it was good! Everything is super fresh, affordable, and clean. The portions are big, so be mindful of spiting with a friend if so inclined. Also I would recommend getting your delicious food to go and sit in the park just to the south. The wait to sit inside can be very long.\n\n\n\n\n\nProof that great things come in small packages :)\nMatt's Big Breakfast is SMALL, lol!\n \nThe local organic coffee that they serve is awesome & I have to drink it even when I'm melting outside. \nMy must have, by far though, is the honey lemonade.... oh yeah! \n\nEverything they make is fresh, organic & delicious. I had the breakfast special. I have to say that the eggs tasted a bit different to me, but maybe it's because I've rarely had REAL eggs before, lol. I'm used to the thin shelled, mass produced, break up a bunch & keep them in a container till someone orders something with eggs in it kind of taste. They don't even crack them open until they are making your order. Cage free eggs from happy well fed chickens is the way to go :)\n\nThe only con I have to point out is the waiting line if you don't get yourself down there early enough. Especially in this heat! My friend decided that we should, but if her makeup started melting off we'd have to find somewhere else for breakfast, lol. Fortunately, we were called in just on time!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth the wait if there is one!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears as if my first review of this fine establishment was pushing the envelope a bit, so allow me to reintroduce my opinion of one of my favorite places to dine in this city. \n\nMatt Pool and his breakfast restaurant have received national critical acclaim for their use of local, fresh, organic ingredients and their simple traditional preparation of American breakfast classics. \n\nThe number one complaint I encounter about this restaurant is the wait. Of course there's a wait, it's probably the most famous breakfast joint in this state, and there's a reason people flock to it 6 days a week: because its really good food served by a really good staff. I'm sure that the people who complain about the wait here are the same people who complain about the wait at Pizzeria Bianco. \n\nTo all of those people, I pose this question to you: since when has dining out in America become this rush to get in, stuff your gullet and get out as fast as possible? Why is dining in this country no longer about the experience and the socialization you get with your fellow diners? Why not come downtown, sign up for a table, and then stroll down to Fair Trade for a latte while you wait, or take a nice walk around and see what the Roosevelt district has to offer? We're always in such a hurry...I say it's nice to slow down, spend some time with our friends and family and nosh on a breakfast that is totally worth the wait. I believe that many restaurants have spoiled the average American consumer with instant gratification--how many times have you refused to wait at a restaurant because the wait was 30+ minutes? We want good food, and we want it now, screw everyone else, and if you can't feed our bellies within 30 minutes, we'll take our business somewhere else. This attitude is crap. \n\nYou have to slow down and appreciate how hard this little restaurant works. Matt's wife is there 6 days a week to ensure that their business is performing at the level at which it should. The kitchen staff is there from 6:00 am to almost 4pm sometimes churning out thousands of plates of fried eggs, thick peppered bacon, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, pork chops, burgers...The point is, a lot of love and thought has gone into this restaurant to make sure that every single ingredient put on your plate is of the highest quality possible and is prepared by a very talented kitchen staff. \n\nIt is a small restaurant, but it's always warm and inviting, and the coffee is always hot and fresh and they might not serve you a huge glass of orange juice, but it's always 100% fresh, squeezed that morning by the staff. \n\nAfter my plea to try and understand the other side of this restaurant, I know that I may not have been able to make everyone stop and reconsider any opinions they might have about this place: the wait, the small serving of orange juice, the confined areas, and that's OK. All I'm saying is that this place is an institution in downtown dining...and it's really nice to go an experience the food, the service and the though that goes into running this business if only every once in a blue moon. And if not, that's OK, because there are plenty of people who will gladly take your place in line.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally fantastic breakfast. Not for vegetarians, I guess, because one of my dining companions was not impressed (except, I think she liked the eggs), but I was in hog heaven. Great atmosphere in a city bereft of great atmosphere. Seriously. I asked the hot counter girl what there is to do in Phoenix. She seemed confused by the question. But at least she was hot. Yeah, sorry for even going there, but all the women who worked at Matt's when I was there were really friggin' hot, and I can't honestly say as an honest Yelp reviewer that it didn't count as a factor in the number of times I returned here. But what I can also say is that I wouldn't have gone near the place, hot serving wenches notwithstanding, had the food not been completely, utterly satisfying. Totally worth a drive across the \"city\" for. Really. I mean. Being from New York, I tend to compliment nobody. I enjoyed Matt's. So congratulations, management. You hired the right people. You cook a mean egg. You know what to do with pork. All of this was appetizing, satisfying, and filling. YUM.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast math.  quality real ingredients + cooked  well = Great food\n\nMy wife and I stopped by to find that we were too late, the place closed 20 mins earlier.  Nuts!  \nAs we were walking away discussing how we were going to come back another day, the door behind us opened and we were invited in!!! yahoo!!! What a treat.  That never happens!!!  Thanks Matt's you rock!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food at Matt's was delicious!  Went there on Thursday and got there around 10 and only waited 5 minutes.  I had the pork chop which comes with eggs, potatoes, and toast.  My son had the waffle with bacon. I also ordered a side of bacon so I could try it as we'll.  It was all delicious.  The food was very flavorful and well seasoned.  My son is 10 years old and is a picky eater.  He loved the waffle and ate almost his whole plate.\n\nI will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI got there at 1 on a Sunday and waited for about an hour to get seated. The place is really small so I'm sure there is always a wait. No bathroom. \n\nFood was great. Everything was really fresh. I think there were 5 things to chose from and the one thing I really wanted ran out as I ordered. Majorly bummed. \n\nI would love to come back but seriously am dreading the wait!\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is good. Simple. Not worth the prices nor the wait. A small glass of orange juice is $2.50, which seemed a little pricey. Menu is small.\n\nHighly recommend going just to try it yourself, seeing how much fame it gets. I think they can pull it off giving that there's not many places that serve breakfast downtown.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matt's was a short walk.  Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast.  There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it.  When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL food (not the processed crap you find at Denny's).  Super friendly and fast service.  Family owned and operated.  Local ingredients  Great portions.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, maybe a few more tables to shorten the wait.  But that's all part of the charm!  This is my pick for the best breakfast in Phoenix!\n\nSOOOOO delicious!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy final meal in Phoenix, which was breakfast. This small brick place has made me famous with the name (of course) and was honored with a \"Review of the day\", which seems like a distant-memory ago. My first visit and first meal back then was a monumental one. Will my return to \"my\" breakfast place be a repeat? \n\nSome things hasn't changed much about my place. There was a little wait for a table, especially on a early weekday morning. \"My place...why should I have to wait for a table?\"\n\nThis time, my return back has got me ordering one of the breakfast specials, which was the Salami Scramble. For $5.95 and affordable meal too, I get three scrambled eggs mixed with Soppresata Salami with a side of Hash Browns and a pair of thick toasted Sourdough Bread with Strawberry Preserves. The crispiness of the sliced salami blended with the scramble eggs made it a tasty combination. The hash browns were tasty and a nice compliment to my meal. And the thick-ass toasted Sourbread bread with melted butter and the preserves was crunchy with a powerful explosion that can be heard all over the small diner (in a good way).\n\nMy place hasn't failed in my return. I'm always welcome to come back and dine at my breakfast place whenever I come back to Phoenix. And so, you can too.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been told about Matt's countless times and always heard about what a tiny place it was, but until I actually went for the first time, I never got the irony in the name \"Matt's Big Breakfast.\" \n\nI was doped up on anesthesia, so I really enjoyed sitting at the window bar so I could people watch, and so that the other patrons could not watch my weird facial expressions. \n\nFor a vegetarian, the menu did not have a huge offering, but it was a clear choice for me: egg and cheese omelet with cheddar and provolone, hash-browns, sourdough toast and coffee. \n\nUmmm... DELICIOUS!!!! Seriously, this breakfast was really awesome. I might have gained five pounds from the butter it was all cooked in, but really, who cares. \n\nThe blackberry jam they happened to be serving that day was absolutely phenomenal, and I hate jam, so you know it must have been good. \n\nI don't know if they have a bathroom but it did not appear so. As previously mentioned in probably every review and earlier in my review, this place is reallllly small. \n\nThe service was great. They served our drinks, took our order and served our food quicker than I expected, especially since the place was packed the entire time. \n\nThe only thing that kept this place from being 5 stars was the coffee. It just wasn't good. Call me a coffee snob if you must.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing a huge fan of breakfast (who isn't?) I got really excited when I found this place using my handy dandy Yelp app on my iPhone. You see, me and 3 of my friends were in Phoenix to see the Dodgers play the Diamondbacks in a big league game at Chase Field. The bad news is the dodgers lost, but the good news is we had breakfast the next day at Matts. \n\nReading the reviews on Yelp got me way excited to eat there. People were raving about this place as if it was a small piece of heaven on earth. \n\nWe walked there from our hotel and Were quickly seated. Our first thought was, 'tiny'. But we liked that about the place. Very cozy and welcoming. Old school almost. \n\nI ordered the pancakes with a side of egg and bacon. I always have to try the pancakes first whenever I go to a new breakfast joint. It's my measuring stick. If the pancakes suck, most likely everything else will also. \n\nAfter waiting about 10 minutes the kind and very friendly waitress began to bring our food out. One at a time. Over a few minutes. She explained to us that they only had one grill so they would bring out the food as soon as it was done cooking. Again, 'tiny'. \n\nLet me tell you the wait was worth it. The pancakes were amazing. Soft, fluffy, stick to the roof of your mouth goodness. The best pancakes I have ever had. Not to mention the maple syrup was amazing. Top notch bacon and the eggs cooked like my mom made them. I was in breakfast nirvana. My only regret was leaving bits of pancake on my plate. After eating different, but equally amazing, items from my friends plate I was full. I felt like I had let my pancakes down. \n\nAs we left the restaurant we did the touristy thing to do and took a picture next to Guy Fieri's image on the wall. And had no shame about it. \n\nIf your in Phoenix you have to go to Matts Big Breakfast. There's nothing really 'tiny' about the flavor of the food there. \n\nOh and the people who were raving about Matts as of it were a small piece of heaven are all wrong. It's more like a bog chunk of heaven if you ask me.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am 26 years old and I've had a lot of good breakfasts, but I can honestly say this was the best breakfast I've ever had!  We waited 45 minutes at 10 am on a Sunday morning and it was SO worth the wait!  The bacon was semi-sweet, super thick, and had peppery spices on it.  The eggs were fluffy and were so good they did not need salt.  The potatoes had rosemary or lavendar or something and were amazing.  My husband had the steak, it was phenomenal, my bro and sis in law had pancakes that were the best I've ever tasted.  This meal was so good it was almost erotic.  Hubby and I slept all day after.  Eat there.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, we went with a group of six on a Tuesday morning at 10:30am and STILL had to wait about 45 minutes for two tables of 3.  BUT, the food was worth the wait as I had the delicious special with jalapeno and sausage scrambled, with hash browns and a fresh tortilla.  Awesome!  Great coffee too!  In fairness the line moves pretty fast, but this is a small place so if you're considering coming with a big group, be forewarned that you'll wait longer for a table together.\n\nWe also learned while we were eating that Matt's was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network.  So that may be the reason for the business too...fewer locals and more looky-loos.\n\nRegardless, I'd go back in a flash and highly recommend Matt's!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were visiting AZ this past weekend, and decided to try Matt's based on all of the great YELP reviews.  After an hour of waiting outside in the rain, the host called our name and said, \"we'll be seating you shortly\" and handed us menus.  He then came out 5 minutes later and said he was going to take our orders so he could get the kitchen started.  When we were finally seated (at the counter - not even a table) our food was served in about 10 minutes.  It was good (a little greasy) but I would never again wait an hour for breakfast.  Also, they don't have a bathroom in the facility.  You have to go next door!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's tempting to suggest, \"an egg is just an egg\". You hear that kind of thing a lot, and admittedly, there have been plenty of \"legendary\" breakfast places that have made me feel just that. Matt's Big Breakfast is not one of them.\n\nWhat makes MBB unique is the quality of the food and the quality of the ingredients they use to make it. True, there menu is small, and when you read it, nothing particular will jump out at you , but that doesn't mean there's nothing special on it. For instace, everybody serves hashbrowns but these are without a doubt THE BEST hashbrowns I have ever had. The omlettes and eggs are great too. \n\nNo doubt, Matt's serves five-star food. It only loses a star because it's a little pricey and the wait is usually waaay too long. Maybe I shouldn't hold that against them, but I do...so get over it. \n\nAlso, their lunch is just average, and of course, they close far too early.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has to be the best breakfast I've ever had!  I ordered the special which was scrambled eggs with sweet peppers, whiskey fennel sausage and Havarti cheese.  It was outstanding!  We had to wait for over an hour which we knew that going in.  The food was definitely worth the wait.  Looking forward to going back again!\n\n\n\n\n\nwas in town for a convention and was so surprised how good the food in phoenix was!\n\nComing from the LA area, you become kind of a food snob, but Matt's Big Breakfast beats all.  \n\nThe BEST Belgium waffle I have ever had.\nWait was a little long on the Saturday morning for a table for 3, but it was well worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nBacon? Outstanding.  Griddle cakes?  Crave-worthy.  Home-fries?  Awesomely awesome.  Service?  Ehhh.  Love this little joint tucked into a one-bedroom house!  The food was amazing -- I can still taste those griddle cakes, BUT the service left something to be desired (more about that later).  My hubby got the three-meat scramble with hashbrowns, and it came with a tortilla.  He gobbled it down, apparently it was really good.  We never got any hot sauce, after two requests.  I ordered the two-egg breakfast with bacon.  The bacon was to die for, the best I think I've ever had.  The thick sourdough toast which accompanied my meal was served with real butter and fresh strawberry jam.  The combo was killer!  All in all, a fantastic breakfast!\n\nAbout the service -- The female waitress who greeted me at the door specifically told myself and two other parties that were waiting that they ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES, no waiting at the table for someone else to show.  She must have said this three or four times.  I pointed to my hubby, who was parking the car across the street and told her he'd be here in just a minute, and she reiterated, WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.  I was told to add my name to a list outside, even though he was 30 seconds away!  An older woman appears at the door and asks for a table, and tells the waitress her husband is parking the car.  \"Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now,\" says the waitress.  No \"WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.\"  No \"ADD YOUR NAME TO THE LIST OUTSIDE EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS.\"  Noooooo.  Instead it's \"Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now.\"  GRRRRRR.  I piped up and said, \"Oh, here he is.  We're ready now.\"  The waitress responds, \"I'm going to get her a table, I'll be right back.\"  GRRRR.  I HATE people who say one thing and do another.  I was seeing red at this point, but the place is so danged small I couldn't tell my hubby what I was so pissed off about!!!  Anyhow, the waitress \"that wouldn't seat us\" buzzed our table once or twice, and I asked for water THREE TIMES before a very kind gentleman waiter got it for me.  They forgot my OJ -- he brought it out after I asked the other waitresses TWICE.  Hot sauce?  Never appeared on our table, even after two requests.  Just a tip -- the female waitresses were ditzy as hell.  Ask for a male waiter!!  (sorry if that sounds sexist, but I'm a woman and I know what good service looks like.  This was NOT IT.)\n\nMy rating above is based on the FOOD (5 STARS) minus one star for the SERVICE (TWO STARS).  (I know, I know, five minus two is three, but I just couldn't bring the food rating that low, It was THAT GOOD)  In fact, I think I'm heading out now for some of those griddle cakes.  From a male server.  See ya!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had an excellent meal here.  There were two of us and we arrived at about 7:30am on a Saturday.  We waited only 25 minutes.  We could have been seated at the counter sooner but decided to wait for a table.  The service was EXCELLENT.  For the type of  food you get here it did take longer than expected to be brought to our table though.  My omlette was cooked perfectly, the wheat toast was outstanding.  I was expecting traditional home fries but was surprised when they brought me Yukon Gold potatoes cut up and lightly browned with olive oil and rosemary.  The bacon was also cooked just right.  I also tried a couple of bites of their waffle which was good and I will most likely order that next time.  While it is a small place, you do not feel to cramped inside nor is it too loud to have a conversation across the table.   Portions are a good size and for both of us the bill was $20.00.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of all of the other yelpers describing the long waits, my partner and I decided to try Matt's on a Wednesday, mid morning.  We waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  I enjoyed the unpretentious atmosphere of Matt's Big Breakfast.  The service was excellent.  When I say excellent, I mean our waitress took our drink orders immediately, answered our questions expertly, and brought our meals exactly as ordered (which is impressive because I can be a tad high maintenance).  Our food was pipping hot and very tasty.  I had the cheddar omelette and added mushrooms and onions. I ordered home fries (roasted potatoes with rosemary and onions) and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The orange juice was just the right size, and not too sweet.  The omelette was chock full of mushrooms, onions and cheddar.  The potatoes were golden brown and delicious with a little extra salt.  My partner ordered the griddle cakes which she said were soft, buttery and with the real maple syrup, yummy.  While Matt's is pretty small, I think there's plenty of room to enjoy a great meal!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad great expectations after highly recommended by others. The breakfast was good, nothing extraordinary though. The service was a disappointment, server was very forgetful and put off by some simple requests. It doesn't look like they need my business though, considering the line to get in. I probably wont be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been a fan of Matt's for the last 3 years. I go there at least once a week to meet with my circle of friends. Ernie the owner has become a great friend and is an awesome example of someone who has connected with the culture of urban Phoenix. The only drawback which is also Matt's strength is that it is a small place good for only groups of 4 or so. I have had Matt's all to myself with bigger groups of 20 but it requires planning ahead. I suggest going with either the Hog and Chick or try the waffles.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistently the best breakfast joint in Phoenix.\nThis place blows the competition out of the water without any pretension. The line is long but worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food...good service...bad location...long wait. The food gives it the xtra star. Triple D...c'mon man!\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, someone please explain something to me, WHAT ON EARTH HAS MADE THIS PLACE SO POPULAR????? I went to check this place out after seeing it on DDD. It looked interesting and the food looked like it could be pretty good. Well, not to sound mean or anything but, I can make much better breakfast in my own kitchen for about half the price. Any Denny's in America makes a better breakfast and you don't have to wait in line for an hour and a half either. Im sorry but I just don't get it. The only thing that \"wasn't\" completely average was the bacon. The portions were WAY to small and the food was WAY, WAY over priced. \"Good food, good portion size, good price\". This place breaks all 3 of those rules. Come on people lets stop following the crowd and lets try and open our minds a little. If everyone would do that I don't think Matts would be in business much longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nLines, lines lines.  and the food was marginal at best.  I ordered the steak and eggs.  It was fine.  Better than Dennys, but worth the hype and wait...uh no.  I don't think so.  If you want a great breakfast/brunch/lunch without the wait at a reasonable price, head over to Gallo Blanco.  Those guys know how to get it done.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went on a Thursday around 10:30 and didn't expect a long wait... surprise, surprise, we waited an hour. Other than the wait (which was expected) the food was delicious. Everyone working at Matt's were friendly (they all say goodbye to you as you leave). I definently recommend getting the bacon as a side if it does not come as part of your meal. If you can't stand the heat, order carryout or show up later (at 11:30 there was maybe a 15 minute wait).\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a huge fan of matts. Have been for 2 years now. Their service is great, but more importantly their food is amazing. Always order teh home fries. My favorites are the hog and chick and the big butter burger. The only slight downfall is the wait, if it looks like there are 25 people in front of you on the list, it might be best to just go another time.  Unless you're willing to wait more than two hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy far THE BEST place to go for breakfast when you're in Phoenix.  Now stop reading, get off the Internet and get to Matt's right now.  The line will be long.  Enough said...\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought this place was great! The wait wasn't that long at all, coming from NY I have seen alot worse. The actual restaurant itself is very small, obvious reason for the wait.  I ordered the Special of the Day - Huevos Rancheros along with an order of Griddle Cakes, both were quite delicious. Overall, the only negative was the wait which again wasn't as bad I was expecting.  \nI definitely will come back to this place, guaranteed a good breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you anticipate the wait at Matt's Big Breakfast, you'll have nothing to complain about. Put in your name, go get a coffee from Jobot, and relax. The staff is friendly and doesn't seem stressed about getting people in and out, and once you're seated and order your food, it comes out super quick. And it is fantastic. Hashbrowns have never been so glorious. Thank you Matt's, for a delicious place to start the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place is so cute and unique. It is always crowded. I crave for their harshbrown. I think theirs is the best I ever tasted! It is crunchy and yummy. My husband loves their pork chop. I recommend to come early because they are usually packed with local people\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good stuff, Though I waited near 30 minutes for a two top :)  The food was good, the hasbrowns , cooked in REAL butter were nice and crispy, the griddle cakes muy deliciouso!  I don't recomend the bacon, as it was a bit undercooked, but do try the honey lemonade! WOWZA!  I am considering going back when it's not so busy.\n\n\n\n\n\nstopped by matt's this morning. it was my second visit. for my first visit back in january, i ordered the salami scramble ... yummy, yummy, yummy! 3 eggs was a little much, but hey the name says big breakfast for a reason. salami portion was larger than expected (in a good way) hashbrowns were crispy and delish and the artisan bread toast with organic plum jam was phenomenal. \n\ntoday, i was in the mood for a carb overload and ordered the waffle. ohmigod, an orgasm for my taste buds! slightly sweet, very fluffy with just a little crispy on the outside sprinkled with powdered sugar and paired with a big ol' scoop of butter in the middle and a generous portion of syrup in a cute little mini pitcher on the side. two  t-h-i-c-k  slices of bacon stacked on top. i ate the whole thing ... matt's, you make dieting impossible! syrup was notably tasty. also ordered the fresh squeezed oj: the perfect blend of orangy, slightly tart, full of pulp goodness. service was friendly and quick; i was in at 6:37 and out before 7:10. i felt welcome to stay longer, but alas, work was calling my name.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe got to Matt's on a Sunday afternoon and only waited about 15 minutes! Hooray, what a good start to what I hoped would be the best breakfast/brunch experience I've had in my 7 years in Phx! The service was outstanding, too!\n\n My fianc got the Salami Scramble and I got the Chick and Chop. Maybe it's because I grew up in the south where food like this is pretty standard, but I really didn't taste anything special about the breakfast, even though I really wanted to have the \"foodgasm\" that so many others here claim. The hashbrowns were good, but very, very greasy, and my porkchop was overcooked and very dried out, and was completely overpowered by Rosemary, which I typically love. \n\nMy highest compliments go to the honey lemonade, the berry preserves we were given for the thick sourdough bread, and, of course, the waitstaff! Overall, I think the place is overhyped, much like Pizzeria Bianco, but worth a shot for the experience.  I personally would have felt robbed had I waited more than 15 minutes and gotten food that just made me go \"eh.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVery good, if you're looking for fancy decor you won't find it here.  If you are looking for a delicious well cooked breakfast, this has to be one of the best places in Phoenix.  I had the Hog and Chick very fulfilling meal.  Only thing I didn't like was the parking situation, not good.  Parking meters in front bring change.\n\n\n\n\n\nI journeyed off after on my quest to find a good breakfast spot. Decided to drive to Phx and give Matt's a try. \n\nParking isn't easy. My super hero foresight made me move my car just in the nick of time! Sorry for the truck that got the ticket..\nAnyhow not a big selection to choose from. I decided to have two eggs over easy, off the bone ham(extra$), hash browns, wheat bread, and a\nCoffee..coffee was okay just coffee...not that I was expecting more..plate came up right away. Looked good. Ham was great! Would make a great sandwich with cheese. Eggs were eggs..Hash browns were good but I have a better idea...they were crunchy on outside and oily in the middle, it's bot bad just missing something...\nI would NOT stand in a ridiculous line for this place....\n\n\n\n\n\nBe prepared for a very very very long wait and don't come hungry. What? Don't come hungry when you're coming out to eat breakfast? Exactly! Wait time may be 2-3 hours so please do yourself a favor and snack or eat light before you come. So what tempted a Tempe girl to come out to Phoenix to eat at Matt's Big Breakfast...Triple D DUH! Haha...Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy! He's the man! Who doesn't love him? I'm sure many people are stalking his eating stops. So cool, they have his face stenciled on the wall. \n\nOkay, so you get here and it's so teeny tiny that there's just a little stool with a waiting list. Write your name down and feel free to take off for a bit. Walk around downtown...bring board games...don't plan on just waiting outside because #1. There may not be anywhere to sit and #2. Your bottom will be very sore from sitting so long. This restaurant is in an old lobby of an old motel. You know, the old motels with the little detached lobby the size of a one car garage. I would not recommend bringing a group here...they will not be able to fit you. If you're not up for the experience but would like to try the food, they do have carry-out as an option and it will probably only take 15 minutes or so. Once you finally get seated you can't help but wonder, how oh how do these people work in this tiny room all day? Man! It is t-i-n-y! Okay, so now that I have stressed how small this place is (tiny) lets move on. :-) I ordered what Guy ordered, The Chop and Chick. A pork chop with eggs. It comes with toast and your choice of hash browns or home fries. The chop was smaller, not life changing, but very tasty...it had great seasoning. Only $8 too. Home fries were a five out of five. Very good! No soda machine here...they sell RC Cola by the can though. $1.25 a can...My Dad had the griddle cakes and he said that they were the best pancakes he's ever had. So funny because we talked to a waitress and she said it's just a regular batter but my dad is a pancake connoisseur and he loved them! Overall, yummy food, great prices but the wait is just way too long to make this a regular spot. I would eat here again but would definitely take it to go...maybe even eat outside where everyone's been waiting for hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, so first for the bad: \nSo the first time I went there was when some friends invited me.\nThey were already at the restaurant, I was still in bed at home in Avondale. I showered, dressed and drove over there...they were still waiting for a table. In fact once I got there we waited another 30 minutes for a table. that means my friends were waiting over an hour and a half for a table.\nMy other complaint is that my potatoes are always too burnt, even when I tell them not to burn them.\nThey are closed on Monday (you would have thought I would remember this the first two Monday;s I came to eat here)\nSo now for the good:\nEverything else! I love the food!\nThe Chop & Chick and griddle cakes are my fave for breakfast and for lunch I love...well just about everything!\nCan't wait till I move back so I can go again!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Matt's Big Breakfast before our morning flight out of PHX airport after seeing reviews here.   We were lucky to find them open on Monday since they were not open Mondays in the past.\n\nThere was no wait for our party of two and were promptly greeted and informed of the daily special.  The waitress was very nice and attentive. \n\nI had the special which was a three egg scramble with canadian bacon and locally grown asparagus along with home fries.  K had the eggs, bacon, and hash browns.  Both meals came with toast and preserves.  Both the wheat and sourdough toast were thick slices and very fresh.  Everything was  fresh and tasty.  (Total bill $22.)\n\nWe will definitely be stopping back here in future trips to the area as it was a delicious meal.  I highly recommend this place to anyone although it is so very small that it is a good idea to get there early (they open at 630) seeing as we got there at 730 and by 815 there was a line to sit.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogled best breakfast in Phoenix and this place  popped up, saw Guy F's review from April this year and it was good so we gave it a try this morning. It is easy to miss because it is so small. It had awesome service, was very fresh and tasty but disappointed because they only have RC Cola ( no refills) and not a huge menu but overall it was good. The special was awesome with home fries, around $8, my son got the waffle ( only get 1) with 2 bacon for around 8-9$ and my husband got 3 pancakes for about 9$ as well. You only get a small amount of syrup so an extra side is $1.50 ( too pricy for 3 pancakes). Bill was $28.00 and I think too much for what we got. The food was good, had to give it a try. Would never wait for more then a few minutes to eat there.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally made my way down to this place.  Was avoiding it because of the long wait everyone talks about but I had more time on my hands today so decided to give it a try.  Arrived around 12p on a Sunday and we were seated in about 45 min (party of 2- apparently, parties of 2 or 3 get seated the quickest).  Th wait wasn't so bad being that we found so shade and I had my phone to keep me occupied.  The hostess was very friendly.  The place is small.\n\nThe menu was a lot smaller than I expected.  For breakfast dishes, there were about 5-7 egg dish choices and a handful of other choices.  I opted for the griddlecakes and my husband ordered an omelette w/ cheddar, sausage and mushrooms.  He had coffee and I had the honey lemonade.  The lemonade was very refreshing, fresh squeezed and just the right sweetness.  As far as the food goes, it was good.  The sausage has a nice spice to it, the griddlecakes were light and fluffy, the strawberry jam and toast were yummy and the omelette was tasty.  My hubs ordered the hashbrowns with his dish and he prob should have gotten the home fries b/c they looked a lot better (based on the table next to us).\n\nI give it 3 stars b/c it's just good fresh food and, for the most part, cooked well (the hashbrowns were a litte more greasy than I prefer).  I don't know if I would go through the long wait for it in the future.  Coming from San Diego (Hash House, the Mission) and LA (The Griddle), it's missing something more unique to make it worth the wait.  I've waited 60-90 min for those places.  Def give it a try if you've never been.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen here a couple times.  Liked it a lot, the food was good, the service is warm and friendly and the wait was fun with friends.  I don't have anything against Matt - I love the Roosevelt and visit there fairly often - I just don't see the point in waiting, in the sun, for breakfast - when it's not that special and if you have to walk into the hotel next door to use the restroom.  I am looking forward to some competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best hamburger in Phoenix is Matt's BIG BUTTER BURGER, bar none.  Get it cooked medium and get the HASH BROWNS on the side, we like them crispy or well-done.  The meat is so tender and flavorful, it melts in your mouth, and the bun is specially prepared just for them.  Super fresh produce on the burger along with a big ole slab of American cheese makes this a burger you'll dream about later on.\nThe Griddle Cakes are our second-favorite item and when we go, we share a Burger and one order of the Cakes and we are both FULL and satisfied.  \nMatt's is truly a hole-in-the-wall, but don't let that deter you.  Figure out when the lines are short and GO, you won't regret it.\nWE LOVE THIS PLACE.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt is a Kansas City native like me and like Kansas City folks knows great food.  Though breakfast is busy, it is worth the outside wait even in the middle of the summer.  The wait staff is great and always on their toes, it is fun to see the owner's wife active in the restaurant filling coffee, delivering food and following up on your experience.  Though the menu is not too long, it has all the classic greats, plus great specials.  For those who like to feel at home for breakfast, this is the place to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll qualify this review up front: all I ever ask for in a breakfast is a pile of extra crispy hash browns and two to three eggs, over easy.  I put the eggs on top, dump some salt, pepper, and tabasco on there, and mix it all up.  If you learn nothing else from me, learn this: that is the way to start the day.\n\nHaving said that, damn does Matt's have some good hashbrowns and eggs.  But I give it extra credit for having delicious looking pancakes, which I've never eaten, and some really damn good honey lemonade.  I had pork chops and eggs there, and I've had the T-bone and eggs there, but the meats are really just a distraction from what I love so much.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, Matt's...how I love you!  The best waffle ever!  The friendliest service.  The most congenial endless wait in the valley.  The locally-sourced foodstuffs.  There's nothing about you that I don't like.  I can sign in on your list, go to the Farmer's Market, come back and sip water w/orange slices and fantasize about what I'm going to eat.  I adore the fresh-squeezed orange juice in the cute glasses with the rooster on them.  And the potatoes with rosemary?  Heaven on a plate!  I have never, ever been disappointed or had a bad experience at Matt's.\n\n\n\n\n\nif u want awsome pancakes... then come here.. but,get ready to wait for a table,and wait outside in the heat for 40mins!!! but,worth all the wait!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast is pretty yummy. I would have to agree though that a big fuss is made over this place. I have had the pancakes twice and both times they seemed dry. I think the biggest problem I have had is having a \"big breakfast\" and not enough to wash down my pancake the size of a UFO with. The juice is understandably \"freshly squeezed\" but a glass the size of a shot glass for almost 3 bucks is ridiculous. Personally I'm not one to enjoy water with a meal, which is probably your best choice so you don't end up spending your life savings on shots of OJ. They do have sodas but in a can and that's if you are an RC fan. The funny thing is I tried once to bring in a drink to help with the aid in digestion of my breakfast and they have a sign on the front door that reads \"No outside beverage\". Damn!\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding food.  Get over the wait people.  That's what happens in a desperate-for-culture town like Phoenix gets a few good places to eat.  You think they complain about this in cities that have a soul?   The waffle-outstanding.  Hashbrowns- best ever.  Bacon-great.   Its local, its fresh and its unique.\n\n\n\n\n\nA really nice place for breakfast, especially on weekdays. The wait in weekends makes it a bit hard to justify at times, and the crowd feels different - folks in their groups who aren't as willing to socialize with others. The weekday crowd feels like more of a community - more solo diners willing to chat. \n\nFood is solid all around - I've had almost everything on the menu and thus stick to the specials most days. You can't go wrong if you're looking for a hearty, well-prepared breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil I read the rant reviews about Matt's I never knew there could be so many people with cold coffee running through their veins.  Wow.\n\nSumming it down, it seems the #1 complaint is at Matt's (unlike Denny's) they have to wait in the hot Phoenix sun to get in or that the place is \"small\".  DUH!  If you go to a place that serves better-than-average food, and it is a small old historic place it's not going to be the same as squeezing your tubby stomach into a booth at Denny's and ordering an \"out of your mind\" $1.99 breakfast to make your butt even bigger.  In other words, if you like Denny's so much why did you go to Matt's?\n\nMake your choice ... pre-processed food from a mega-chain, or fresh food from local guy who works hard to serve locally grown/bought products and has gotten extremely popular because of it.  Small?  Are you kidding?  That's GOOD, not negative, how can you possibly rate a place bad because it is small?\n\nHate the Food Network?  Geez ... then don't go to a place that has been so highly rated.  Why subject your tender spoiled body to waiting in that \"miserable\" Phoenix sun?  People waiting in line means they know where to find great food.  BTW, my first few visits to Matt's were BEFORE Triple-D and it was and remains a place to go for people who have good taste.  And the complaint about having to go to the bathroom in the kitchen is pure BS - the clean bathroom is in the motel next door, not the kitchen.\n\nWe only have one Matt's in Phoenix and thank you heavens.  Is the food good?  Yes?  Is it fresh and uses the best local products?  Yes?  Is the service friendly and local?  Yes (if you're a tourist or Snow-Bird you just won't get this concept anyway).  Somebody believes the OJ is $2.50 for 2 ounces?  Really?  REALLY??  \n\nHere are a few personal observations:  I don't eat potatoes much, but I almost always finish Matt's home fries.  I am not a big bread eater, but I love Matt's fresh home-made bread.  Their eggs are local and bought by Matt every morning (he doesn't own a refrigerator or microwave at his restaurant).  The bacon on NOT what you will find at Denny's (a place you can walk right in to without having to spend 30 minutes of your precious self-consumed life standing in that horrid Phoenix sun). No, NO, I'm serious, there are actually tourists who reviewed Matt's and compared them negatively to DENNY'S!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhere Matt's really shines is not so much their excellent breakfasts, but the fact that they probably make one of the best Reuben Sandwiches in America.  Yes, better than Manhattan, better than that place where you chomp into a lot of fat and bread and pay twice as much for the privilege.  Not only is the sandwich great but the side of homemade macaroni salad is big enough to serve the entire restaurant.\n\nWant to avoid the 30 minute wait for breakfast?  Go to Matt's for lunch when the place is much less busy and get to know the people who work there and why their food is several cuts above most of what you will find in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was great, everyone was very nice and friendly. Also great was the sourdough toast, jam, honey lemonade, and crispy peppery bacon. The hash browns were buttery and crispy on the outside and yummy and creamy on the inside. I didn't care for the salami scramble, the salami was different than any salami I have, but it was definitely plentiful.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know what people expect from a \"diner\".  I took my parents there this week and both of them loved it.  This is not some \"health food\" place for the Birkenstock crowd.  This is traditional diner fare.  Greasy yes, and good.  My Father had the omelet with the hash browns and he loved it.  He even commented on how good the hashies were due to the fact they were slathered in butter/fat.  My mother had the pancakes and she loved them too.  They have corn meal in them which might not appeal to a \"traditionalist\", but they were very good nonetheless.  I had the Belgian waffle and it was very good too.  \n\nThe coffee was typical diner fare as well.  I would not call it drek as I am a coffee snob and roast green beans at home.  The coffee was what I expected from a diner.  We went at 8AM on a Tuesday and walked right in.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  \n\nI would go again with no problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nI loved this place. The wait was bearable because of my company. If you have the right mate you can withstand any wait,. The food was outstanding the service was awesome and the coffe is from the C-4 coffee house in cave creek way cool! I will be back soon, Matty!\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, people must understand that good things (food) come to those who wait.  Imagine if Matt's Big Breakfast seated as many as a Denny's.  They'd be forced to mass cook, quality would go down and service would suffer.  True, this place COULD be a tad bigger, but you can't discount them for being delicious and popular.\n\nThe time my wife and I went, there was only a 20 minute wait, so we strolled around downtown Phoenix, visited the local organic grocer, which I highly recommend, and the time flew by.\n\nWe sat at the bar and got the inside scoop on the place as we chatted to everyone from the busboy to the owner.  And the scoop was, they are opening a high-end organic coffee shop on 5th and McDowell or Thomas,\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved everything about this place, decor, service, food, all get 5 stars. Simple, high quality ingredients cooked perfectly always make for a great experience in my book. Had the Nieman ranch beef burger and it was out of control. Gotta go back to try the namesake Breakfast!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we waited for a table for an hour. in the winter. and it was windy. my hair was flying, my fingers were freezing and I was getting increasingly annoyed. why cant they expand their space just a little bit? The waitress kept running outside to check people off their list, and started handing out menus so that we could order. It took the joy of of looking at the menu and deciding what to eat. I was looking forward to a nice leisurely brunch after which we planned to go to the museum.  We would have left, except that this was downtown Phoenix and dint want to lose our parking spot. \n\nFinally, after a little more than an hour, we were seated. the place is TINY. Tables are close together and just as luck would have it, we got a table right next to the door, where every time she opened it, i was greeted with nice gush of COLD air. And people waiting outside could see us sit in the warmth and eat.\n\nThat being said, the food was excellent. I can't seem to remember names of our dishes, but the eggs were very good, with potatoes, toasted sourdough bread, orange juice and coffee.\n\nBut was the wait really worth it? I don't know! I don't think I'd want to wait for so long for a table. I'd recommend this place to friends for sure though. I think I just contradicted myself! don't get me wrong - excellent food. just that the waiting pissed me off. a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall place, but a great breakfast. The waffle was perfect and the service was prompt. We went during the week, and the wait was about 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove, love, love this place.\n\nGot there at 7:15 on a Sunday, waited only five minutes and got right in. Today they had a great steak & eggs special, it was out of this world. I brought a friend who had never been there, and she loved her food as well. One thing I recommend is to order a pancake on the side (in case no one in your party orders a full order). The pancakes are unreal, they are SO good, and if you've never tried them, do yourselves a favor, and try them.\n\nAs usual, service was on point, and even though the place is packed and super busy, everything was taken care of. When I read negative reviews of the place, all I ever see is complaints because there is a wait, etc.\n\nIt is important to note, this is NOT an IHOP, or Goodegg. You WILL wait to get in, and it is worth every minute of the wait. If you're not able to do that, then perhaps you should go elsewhere. Also, if you have more than a party of four, please consider either breaking into smaller groups, or go somewhere else. \n\nThe food at Matt's Big Breakfast is thoughtfully planned, prepared, and executed. If you haven't been yet, enjoy it!\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't normally like to share reviews without giving some critique for improvement. So... Matt's Big Breakfast- amazing food, delicious, flavorful. My girlfriend and I went suedo-hungry, the wait as we knew and expected was long and limited with seating, but totally worth it. Blythe time western sat, very hungry. We tore over the menu and order the Five Spot sandwich and the special. Both of us agreed we've never had a more delicious breakfast! Honestly was expecting a little letdown, but didn't. Awesome spot, will recommend to anyone with taste buds and time to relax. No wonder Guy Fieri came here!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nOh my god. My first experience at MBB was on Good Friday, and it made it an Awesome Friday. The bacon was one of the more memorable things. Thick and cooked perfectly. Oh! And that delicious Honey Lemonade. Such a quaint little spot. Cute, small restaurant makes it feel small-town. The wait wasn't too bad either, but, I haven't been on the weekend yet. \nCan't wait to go again!\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as everyone says, the food is awesome! BUT...if it's served with an attitude, damn it drags the experience down. I was totally disappointed in the place. Maybe a too go order would be good for you? Food is still good enough to fetch four stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis great breakfast spot is now open on Mondays too!\n\nYUM!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Matt's, BUT! (read on)\n\nI love Matt's - the food is amazing! I love that Matt and his wife are so friendly and they always remember me whether I come into Matt's or The Roosevelt (granted, I AM pretty memorable).\n\nHowever...\n\nThe wait - it is out of control. Now I understand why Hawaiians hate mainlanders - because they have to wait at their favorite spots due to clueless tourists! \n\nHere is my solution, and Matt, if you read these reviews, seriously, consider what I have to say because I am in Mensa (not officially, but I would be if I took the test... I'm certain of it).\n\nSet aside a certain block of time for \"LOCALS ONLY\", for example, from 6:30 - 8:30 only locals are seated. How does one weed out locals from the lemmings in Tommy Bahama shirts and cameras standing outside? Easy. You must have a card that is punched each time you eat there, and once you have received 5 punches you are considered a local (granted, the first 5 times you go you will be treated like a tourist, but if it's your first time and you're a local, well hell, you're a tourist in my book). Once said card carrying local is verified as legit, he or she keeps the validated card and presents it from that time on.\n\nNow, I can already hear all the naysayers finding fault in this idea, including you Matt. But here's the truth - LOCALS keep this place humming. Tourists are one time tricks, although they do contribute to sales, it is miniscule in comparison to the long term revenue generated by Phoenicians. \n\nSo please Matt, do something that is not pc, but is good for the people that take care of you - take care of them back, get the locals in before Mr. & Mrs. Tommy Bahama. This is an amazing idea, and some restauranteur will read this and do it if you don't, so be the first, be a rebel - locals will love you for it, they will cheer your name in the streets and name their first born after you. \n\nLove, \n\nBrandon\n\n(dictated but not read)\n\n\n\n\n\nI like the bright, small-diner atmosphere and the use of cage-free eggs, organic produce and grain-fed natural Iowa pork and Angus beef.  I found the rationale stated on the backs of the menus and on the website, \"We believe that food prepared this way not only tastes better but is better for you\" quite ironic considering the amount of butter and olive oil their food is fried in.  My stomach couldn't take it.  I guess if I go back for breakfast, I can always get the Frosted Flakes for $4.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many others saw this place on triple D.  Have eaten here a couple of times since and have enjoyed it every time.  Go out on a limb and order some of the odd combos they have as speacials and you won't be sorry.\n\nA lot of people complain about the wait however there is one sure fire cure for it.....get up a little early and be there prior to 8am and the wait will be very short.  A group of 8 of us arrived at 745 and were in at 8am.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe waited a little less than 2 hours at Matt's- we went on a Saturday morning around 10:00am. I ordered the 5 spot with hash browns. \nThe hash browns were really good, thin & crispy. I didn't really like my sandwich that much, it was ok. I didn't really cAre too much for the grilled onions & thick bacon....I think I prefer thinner crispier bacon? All in all I wouldn't wait 2 hours again to eat here- it seemed average to me but glad I tried it. Oh & one last thing I didn't like that they didn't have free refills on beverages...it was sold by the bottle or can.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a few times of walking past the group of hungry patrons waiting for their table at Matt's Big Breakfast, it was about time to stop in and try it myself. It was certainly worth the wait, and there is definitely nothing small about the breakfast. I had the special of the morning - three egg scramble with provolone, chicken sausage and spinach, and Sean S. had the griddlecakes. My scramble was the perfect mix of egg-y cheesy deliciousness for a Sunday morning breakfast. The home fries it came with were also mouthwatering. I think onions and fresh rosemary can make any potato taste good, and Matt's certainly had mastered this mix. I did try some of Sean's griddlecakes, and they were perfection - melt in your mouth, fluffy, and buttery. Finally, the service and the atmosphere were great. I don't think my waistline could handle Matt's often, but the breakfast is worth the indulgence occasionally.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW! This is one of the best breakfast I've had in years, from the fresh OJ, amazing Cave Creek Coffee, special three egg scramble with bacon, locally grown peppers and fontina cheese, with a tortilla and oh the rosemary home fries... drool. My family took me here and I would recommend this to anyone who lives in or is visiting Phoenix. Tuesday morning we waited about five minutes for a table. This really is the best quality local produce in a great little diner. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will have to try the Butter Burger.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice new location with the same small feel and long lines to get in. Awesome bacon! I generally order sausage with eggs but you have to get the bacon here. I have ordered the burger before and it is a very good size good quality burger. Don't missed the old location which is less than a block away from the new restaurant. DDD was there for a reason.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the hype this was an overpriced disappointment. I orderd the griddlecakes with milk and coffee to drink. I also ordered a side of bacon as several reviewers recommended it. Including tax but not tip my total for breakfast was $16.01.  \n\nThe pancakes tasted like Bisquik and the bacon was crispy black and looked and tasted like the cheap grocery store bacon you buy in the shrink-wrap packages. Even funnier the \"three pieces\" were actuallly only 1/2 pieces of bacon at around 4\" long. Overall I've had much better breakfasts at The Good Egg and First Watch at a lower price. \n\nAnother disappointment was waiting for me in the parking lot. An employee had parked her white Volvo behind my car and blocked me in. I first waited for her to finish unloading the car, assuming she would move the car after she was done. Instead she came out once more, closed the the trunk and went back inside. I had to go back inside and ask her to move.  The employee did finally move her car but she didn't bother to apologize.\n\n\n\n\n\ntasty pasty!  \n\nmy favorite part of my experience was the butter and the jam. DEEELISSHHHH. \n\ni could hardly make a dent in my pancakes but I couldn't just let that butter go to waste, so i put the rest of the butter on a piece of pancake and ate that. it would have been weird if i just ate the butter, but i would have. I got the rest to go and asked for extra butter to come along with it. I think the pancakes were amazing, but it could have just been that butter. \n\nI must have thought I hadn't eaten in years bc I also ordered the bacon which is the best bacon i've ever had. let's add that to my list of best part. bacon, strawberry jam, and butter. healthy eating at it's finest. \n\nI also had the homefries but they needed salt and didn't go well w the ketchup they are served with. \n\nI would go back and order strawberry jam toast,  mountain of butter, and 12 slices of bacon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is absolute heaven when you are hungover.  The omelets are huge and fluffy, stuffed with deliciousness.  I love the thick cut bacon!  They definitely do not skimp on the good stuff!  I was talking about it with a guy at The Roosevelt later that night and he told me Matt drives out to Gilbert once a week for that bacon.  Definitely worth it!  The hash browns are even better.  Perfectly crispy without being burned.  Matt's will definitely fill you up at a very good price.  Loved seeing Matt at The Roosevelt that night!  He's awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhoa - what a bunch of spoilsports!  \n\nWhat's not to love about Matt's Big Breakfast (except for the wait)?  My friend and I are serious breakfast aficionados, hailing from Philly where we regularly b'fast at Sabrina's, Honey's, Carmen's Country Kitchen and Morning Glory Diner - all fine, glorious breakfast establishments.  Suffice it to say that neither of us are slouches when it comes to knowing a killer breakfast when we come across one - and he makes a mean frittata himself and I make sublime homemade buttermilk pancakes.  \n\nI read about Matt's online (altho I must say that I somehow fortunately missed the  ridiculously pretentious and nit-picky (too much rosemary for your retainer??? Get a life!) \"yelp\" reviews) so we decided to stop by for breakfast after flying in to Phoenix this past Saturday.  \n\nAs much as we love a good b'fast, we both despise a long wait ... but hey, we had nothing better to do and struck up conversations with other waiting souls and paid a visit to the nearby flea-bag Coronado Motel to use the restroom and soak up the atmosphere.  Matt's provides a cooler of flavored water and the time passed pretty quickly.\n\nIT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT!  It's days later and I can still taste the perfectly light and fluffy (neither undercooked or overcooked) omelette, brimming with top quality cheddar cheese (who could imagine a basic omelette could taste so heavenly?).  The home-fries were bursting with flavor with the addition of rosemary, onions and peppers ... and the toast ... oh the toast ... homemade sourdough cut into thick slices, toasted and served with homemade jam.  My partner's special was eggs blended with some kind of slightly spicy sausage and cheese.  The coffee, too, is perfect, neither too strong or too mild and served with real cream and raw sugar.  \n\nService is fast, friendly and we were treated to the owner's adorable son seating guests and advising of the day's specials.  \n\nDidn't need to eat again until dinner - if you're in Phoenix, ignore the \"yelp\" twitwits - you simply MUST visit Matt's Big Breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nContrary to the reviwers below...I love Matt's. Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee...\n\nBUT....\n\nThis is Phoenix people. When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Denny's and IHOP, you can't beat Matt's. \n\nI love breakfast. I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business. I have never had a better breakfast than at Matt's. Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns.\n\nI wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long. But as a special breakfast treat...you can't beat it.  Just bring your own fan.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I'm watching Diners, Drive-in's and Dive's on the Food Network and they do a feature on this place.  Go on and on about the waffles.  So the next morning, we head over.  Walk up to the building and people everywhere just standing around.  So I walk in side and was stopped by a server and told to step outside.  She handed me a clipboard and walked back in.  Apparently, I was suppose to put my own name down on the list to be seated, so I did.  We waited almost and hour.  We were finally called to head in.  Walk in and can't believe how tiny this place is...they sit the three of us down at a table made for one so we're all fighting over elbow space.  Look over the menu and decide to order a waffle, eggs and OJ.  Server tells me the waffle iron is broken.  That was the only reason I came here because of the so called world famous waffles.  So I settle for pancakes, eggs and OJ.  They bring out my teaspoon of OJ.  Seriously I have never had such a small glass of OJ.  The food finally arrives, and to tell you the truth, it was good but not worth the hour of my life I spent standing outside waiting.  I'll stick to IHOP.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 stars for Matt's. While you can tell that their dishes are made with care and they use quality ingredients (local, when possible), I feel that this place is a little overhyped. The menu is basically glorified Americana diner breakfasts and, while they do it well and with a charm and authenticity rarely found in Phoenix, it's a little boring. Would it hurt to offer some variations of pancakes and waffles?! The pancakes were good - fluffy with a touch of sweetness - but nothing to phone home about. The standout was their breakfast special of the day - a three egg scramble with white cheddar, hot links, and a pepper they described as in between a green chile and a jalapeno. Proably the best egg breakfast dish I've had in a while. As good as it was, though, I can't imagine waiting a half hour or more for it. Luckily we went on a weekday at a good time and had no wait, but I've heard people wait for hours for this food, and it's just not that spectacular. My other complaint is that, for a place with \"Big Breakfast\" in the name, the portions are no larger than what you'd get at Denny's or IHOP. I'm not a proponent of oversized portions at all - I believe it's wasteful and contributes greatly to our nation's obesity epidemic - but, come on, ya gotta live up to your name. Not only that, but some of the prices are a little steep. $2.50 for the tiniest glass of OJ you've ever seen. Service is great, the place is cute, and the food is good, but the media attention and national recognition on Food Network have overhyped Matt's from what it truly is - a friendly neighborhood spot to grab a good, fresh, hearty breakfast made with care.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went at about 9 on a Monday morning, and didn't have to wait in line at all.  I had the Hog & Chick with bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast.  It was fantastic.  The hash browns were a little crunchier on the outside and softer on the inside than I would have preferred, but overall they were good.  The bacon was different, but in a good way.  It was very thick, not overly crispy, a little sweet, and peppery.  I'm not usually a fan of bacon, but really enjoyed theirs.  The toast was fantastic.\n\nPerfect for: when you want a typical breakfast done better\n\n\n\n\n\nWe heard about this from a friend and when I did a google search to find it I came across a video clip from \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" on Youtube. They made it look yummy so I took my hubby there one weekday morning last week. The parking lot was full and there were about 6 people waiting outside. Take a timetravel trip back to the 40's or 50's...there is an old motel and attached to it is this little, TINY diner. You walk up to the door and add your own name and # in party to the paper on the cart by the front door. Find a seat on a bench, if you can. Oh, if you have to park on the street because the lot is full bring some quarters because the spaces are metered.\n\nWe waited about 15-20 minutes. When you go in there is a counter and tables for two around the outside wall. There is at least 1 table for 4 in the back.\n\nI wanted to go here because they claim that they use all fresh ingredients \"No freezer or microwave\" and they use organic when possible. I saw the eggs being delivered and they were regular, not organic. When we were seated the waitress was right there to take our order. Since it was the first time we had been there we were a little slow, felt pressured because they want to turn the tables in this 7 top restaurant.\n\nMy hubby and I both ordered the \"local, organic apple cider\" at $3.95 per glass. It was an 8 oz glass so I felt that was steep! He ordered the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs were perfect, the bacon was limp- he asked for extra crisp, but it tasted good. The hash browns were a very large serving and crisp on the outside but very creamy, mushy on the inside, tasted good. The bread was homemade, 2 thick slices of cranberry walnut and he enjoyed it.  I ordered the waffle. It was a waffle, sprinkled with powdered sugar- which I can't stand and served with warm maple syrup. It came with 2 large slices of pepper bacon. It was all good, but with all the hype I was expecting more. \n\nI saw a woman at the counter eating what I thought was eggs benedict so I asked the waitress. She said it was but that they had just run out! Boo hoo! I would have really enjoyed that! She said it is their special every Thursday and to come back. Now, I checked the website before we went and did not see this special or any others. If it is a weekly special I don't understand why it isn't on the website so people know. \n\nI had to visit the ladies room. Now I have been to some out of the way places but this was really odd! You have to go out of the restaurant, into the hotel next door, wander down the hall...you can hear a tv, there is a no vacancy sign. There is a small sign for \"Matt's customers\", turn right (into a room) the restroom is a unisex bathroom in a hotel room. There is no waste basket for ladies and the hand towel is a real towel on the bar. It was vintage and clean but using the same towel as everyone else is NOT sanitary.\n\nI would go again if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was one of the best brunches I've had anywhere. The servers were very knowledgeable and eager to share their opinion on what's best on the menu. Honestly, everything looked appealing. The portions are fair, the prices even fairer, and the food all excellent. My waffle with two slices of bacon was the best waffle and best bacon I've had. Bacon was thick, not too fatty, and perfectly charred. Waffle had texture and crisp. Real maple syrup on the side :) The special chorizo, jalapeno scramble was nice and hot and spicy! Definitely coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways delicious !! Had their sausage with my breakfast this time, awesome!!\n\nExtra special bonus on my last visit...hot chic working there was wearing super short, super tight skirt, and little... to no underpants..and she kept wanting to pick things up from the floor, this was a great day.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk.  I'm finally getting in tune with Yelp and I'm writing a long overdue review of one of my favorite restaurants of all time-Matt's Big Breakfast.  When I think of what is important to me in a restaurant, it's two things plain and simple-food and service-and Matt's excels at both.  Honestly, these are the type of people, Matt and Ernie and their staff, that America's needs more of...good hearted, honest, hard working people who give a shit about their customers.  They're as American as Apple Pie!  \n\nThe food: everything on the menu is very good but in my mind two things stand out and they are as good as it gets in Phoenix...the waffle and the cheeseburger.  Oh, and the bacon.  A cheeseburger brushed with butter.  Get the fuck outta town.  This is the mother fuckin shit y'all.  I consider myself a burger afficianado and this burger is the bombay.  \n\nThere is an occasional wait because Guy Fieri pimps this place on the Food Network all the time but hell, why wouldn't he, it's the shit.  I pimp it all the time myself.  I may get a Matt's Big Breakfast logo on my pimpstick it's so good.  The best times to go are during the weekdays in the early morning around 7AM or after 1:00PM.  \n\nGoGOGOGOGOGOOGOG....you'll be glad you did!\n\n\n\n\n\n***300th Review***\n\nThis place is so nice, we went there twice!!!\n\nI was on my own for breakfast one morning and had read awesome things about this place. I am so glad I went!\n\nService was friendly and lightning fast!  I went with the recommendation of the server, and got the special: 3 Eggs Scrambled with Wisconsin Cheddar, Chipotle Sausage, and fresh jalapenos.  So simple and so fricken good! OMFG!  The fresh jalapenos were so spicy and yummy!  It also came with hash browns.  I know this is a simple thing, but, seriously, I've never had better hash browns in my life. I also had to order a side of bacon and am so glad I did. YUM!  Good coffee to go with all this too.  \n\n\nLater in the day, the hubby got out of his meeting early so we went to grab lunch there!!!  He loved the Reuben: its flavor, quality and quantity of meat, etc.  Had more hash browns and bacon =)  and tried the waffle. Tasty!\n\nI would go here every week if I lived here. Matt's really has a commitment to local, fresh ingredients and it shows in the food and how buy this place can get!  Am so glad I didn't have to wait for a table though...\n\n\n\n\n\nYUMMMMMM!!  Had the days special scramble: sausage w peppers w hashbrowns; just perfect w a crispy crust & perfect inside not mushy. BF had Chick n Chop. I'm not a fan of pork chops but thaws were flavorful, tender and just super yum!  My only gripe is that I ordered fresh, i got a bout 6oz,  for $2.75 yikes!!!\nCaution it can get crowded and its a pretty small location. But I think it was good, luckily we only waited 15 min but locals say sometimes it can be pretty long\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I say about Matt's?!  I feel very lucky that a friend stumbled upon this place and shared it with me in the early years.  Well worth the wait and one of the best not so hidden gems in town.  There is only one thing keeping me from 5 stars.  Tabasco... really?  In my humble opinion, a breakfast restaurant with no Cholula or Tapatio is missing the essentials.  Tabasco is bush league and Matt ... that is one thing you are not.  Your wife is hispanic, right??  C'mon brother - ditch the tabasco and get the real stuff.  Even your cooks keep a stash of the good stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nHands down the best breakfast I have ever had! I have been here 4 or 5 times, and every meal has been wonderful. The wait is long, depending on the day, and they do not tell you the wait time. It can be up to an hour and a half. If you go on the weekend, get there early! By 9:30 there is a crowd outside. If you are able to go o a weekday, you may be able to be seated immediately. Either way, Matt's Big Breakfast is worth the wait!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I say That Ayesha didn't already cover? I love breakfast..and I love butter. Breakfast + butter + more butter = Matt's. \n\nI had an omelette which was filled with delicious cheese and as Ayesha mentioned the mushrooms had been cooked up in butter before going into the mix which is how I do it at home. The eggs were fluffy and delicious. The toast was thick. THICK. \n\nYes the wait was long. The windows are huge so you can make those already eating uncomfortable by staring at them as they eat which is sort of fun right?\n\nThe shooting pain in my left arm makes it hard to type, but with the smile on my face I am forced to try to put out this one last review before my early death to butter clogged arteries. \n\nThey also got a boost when on the way out every single staff member shouted to us thank yous, and have a good days, and come back soons. Sweet folks. I will have to go back after the bypass surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat am I missing here?  I have heard about Matt's since moving to Phoenix almost 5 years ago, but never wanted to wait outside in the heat to try it.  Now that they have moved into a bigger building, I figured I could try it.  The space is cute -- kind of a minimalist industrial theme.  I was not AT ALL impressed with the menu.  Not much to choose from, and you'll end up having to order items a la carte if you want variety in your meal (e.g., I didn't see any meals that included pancakes, a side of breakfast meat and eggs -- in fact, the pancakes don't even include a side of breakfast meat, so you have to order that a la carte).\n\nI ordered the waffle, which does come with a side of bacon, and an orange juice.  The orange juice, although fresh-squeezed and very good, had to be the smallest glass of OJ I have ever seen. It was basically a large shot glass.  At $2.50 a glass, I felt a little jilted.  The waffle was really good!  It was definitely fresh and buttery.  The bacon left a lot to be desired.  It was pretty fatty, and the pepper crust really didn't add anything to the flavor. \n\nMaybe my expectations were too high based on all of the rave reviews I have heard about Matt's, but my experience was just okay.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the salami scramble and enjoy. \n\nGreat service and amazing food makes the wait almost bearable, but sometimes you just want quality breakfast without putting your name in and getting dolled up  for the paparazzi. \n\nIn the end I'll continue to go and wait in the line, but I don't have to like it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, we all know about the breakfast....I give it a 4. \n\nToday though, I went in for lunch. Gosh dang, 5 stars, it was amazing!\n\nI ordered the Chicken sandwich - Heaven! \nMy friend got the butter burger and he claims it may now be his top burger in Phoenix (even over the Chuckbox!) \n\nHomemade chips, toasted buns, garlic pickle, and just perfectly cooked meat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has great food, great service, great atmosphere...but a crappy wait. \n\nI love eating at Matt's, but I don't go as frequently as I would like because of the wait. I think the food is better than most, they use fresh ingredients from the farmers market down the way, which always improves food quality.\n\nSome people don't like the size of the restaurant, but I love it! It wouldn't be as fun and intimate if it were bigger. I have had Matt's a few times, but today I went at 6:40 (10 minutes after they open) and it was incredible. There was no line and no people, making the feel of a \"small breakfast joint\" feel real. It was calm, quiet, wonderful and reminded me to write a review! So, if you're an early bird and can get there around opening time, I highly recommend it! Otherwise, it's good, but prepared to wait while sipping on some yummy grapefruit water.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing! Such a fun little restaurant. It adds character to downtown Phoenix and the food is great! I got the hot cakes, which were huge and tasted so free, with real butter and real maple syrup. The service was friendly and the atmosphere made me feel like I was back in time at a cute little dinner but with a modern twist. My friend had the special, which was eggs benedict and hashbrowns. Also amazing and you can tell all the ingredients are farm fresh. I'm salvating just thinking about it! The wait wasn't too bad for us. We got their right around 9am and waited for 20 minutes, ate in 40 minutes. However there was quite the line of people after us. I don't suggest going in a large group and only go if you have time for a relaxing morning, long wait but they feed you quickly- but not rushed!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood chicken pesto sandwich.\n\nSuch a tiny kitchen!  Felt strange having to walk through it to get to the broom closet of a bathroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall seating area, long wait. Bathroom was in motel next door. But the food is excellent, definitely worth the wait. Good prices. Currently, my favorite breakfast experience in downtown Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dad and I went there for Breakfast.  It is a little hole in the wall joint which only seats about 15 people.  The prices are high for the amount of Food.  Three pancakes were $8.00 and they were not big at all less than half the plate.  My dad had a bowl of oatmeal which cost $5.50.  I was not impressed the food was just average nothing to rave about.  Also there is no parking except on the street which has meters and no bathroom you have to go to the hotel next door which has a bathroom.  It is very cramped and hardly any room.  I was impressed they had organic milk on the menu but beside this the food was just average.  I suggest not to make a special trip unless you're a DDD person and want to experience it like most of the customers were when we were there.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the home fries get the home fries get the home fries.\n\nHow I never heard of this place before is beyond me. Found it by accident over the weekend and have never been so happy.  Ive been looking for a good greasy spoon breakfast place since i moved here and this place is great.\n\nIts small, there will be a line, but its so worth it.  I got the 5 spot (SUPER thick bacon, REAL eggs, onions, cheese on a roll) and my boyfriend got the griddlecakes, it was delicious.\n\nThe waitresses were nice, the place was clean which i imagine is a chore considering the cramped quarters, and the food is just awesome.\n\nIts casual, you should show up early, and 2 people can eat very well for under 20 bucks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has received a lot of hype, so be prepared to wait.\nand wait.\nand wait.\n\nTo make the trip more enjoyable:\n- don't actually come hungry (or risk passing out in the lot from low-blood sugar)\n- show up at least hour earlier than you want to be seated then get on list\n- go hang out  at the farmers market across street while you wait\n- expect solid (but not mind blowing) food\n\nGo for the experience at least once, then find another breakfast spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nIve been going to Matt's for a couple years now and I have always loved the place. I go for the food because it's the best breakfast in phoenix, but even more for the awesome staff. The owner, who everyone calls Mama- which I think is so adorable- is one of the most welcoming and hospitable people i have ever seen in the restaurant business. Everyone seems like they love working there and they have so much fun together. \nI went this past sunday (11/18) and had a great experience with my husband. He had the steak and it was AMAZING and I had their scramble special which is always a winner. homefries with onions and fresh rosemary are so stinking good. My waitress was a super sweet red head and was so attentive. She checked on us just the right amount of times and went above and beyond to make our experience pleasant. I dont know what these people are complaining about, I've always had great service when we go on the weekends- maybe we will check it out on a weekday and see if its different. \nI was so impressed by all their local use of product and I think its awesome that they get the best ingredients they can. I didn't know how many local business they work with until I asked our waitress and she told us all the different places we were asking about. \n\nWill continue to go to Matts every weekend. Keep up the great work everyone!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning the day as I do most, with a morning run well before the sun is up, the first stop on this 6-stop tour would be downtown - a place I've now discovered to be devoid of most signs of human life on a Saturday...except for a small parcel of land at 801 North 1st Street entitled \"Matt's Big Breakfast\" where a line of thirty or so was already waiting for the approximately 20 seats inside.  Having heard of the nearly decade old establishment owned and operated by Matt Pool during my first visit to Phoenix but unable to make it downtown before ten on any day during that trip (when lines reportedly top two hours despite triple digit temperatures) I have to admit that I really had not anticipated the line to be so long at 6:55am and for a moment I contemplated heading elsewhere, but with my books in hand and nothing better to do my curiosity won out and I added my name to the paper list and took a seat in the rapidly dissipating shade.\n\nSitting and reading while a pair of ASU students talked about having seen Matt's on (presumably a repeat) of Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins the previous night I tried to ignore them (and Guy Fiere's existence in general) while a few people trickled out of the restaurant and with my name at least ten parties down on the list I was surprised when it was called - the solo diner benefit, it seems, landing me an end seat on the counter only fifteen minutes after I arrived and given the expedient service at Matt's a fortuitous happening that had me leaving the restaurant before the aforementioned students had even entered the doors.\n\nSeated at the counter with a menu I'd already memorized in hand and a daily special that held little interest I perused the interior - small, stark, but efficient and exceptionally clean - before my server filled my water glass, offered me coffee, and fielded a pair of questions prior to taking my order and handing it over to the kitchen less than five feet away.  With the space tight and my location literally on the verge of the kitchen and the pass it would not be long before my coffee was filled - a single pour that I subsequently sent back due to a combination of thin mouth-feel, acrid flavor, and no artificial sweetener - and even less time before my stool would be bumped into for the first of thirty times...to say the least this is not a place I'd choose to linger.\n\nSeated and watching the action of the kitchen as plate after plate came through the window and regular after regular chatted with Matt's wife at the cash register it would not be long before my order would arrive and with the restaurant's strong dedication to local/organic/fresh sourcing the items that were presented quickly made me realize why so many people deal with long waits and less-than-comfortable seating to experience Matt's Big Breakfast - the food is really quite excellent, beginning first with a perfect hotcake served with pure maple syrup and far too much (or perhaps just the right amount of) butter for $2.75.\n\nMoving from the dainty golden flapjack to something more substantial, my second dish would actually consist of two plates and four items in the form of \"The Chop & Chick\" - an $8.95 breakfast comprised of a Pan Seared Iowa Pork Rib Chop with 2 Poached Eggs, Hash Browns, and Whole grain Toast with Blueberry Rhubarb Jam.  Apparently their most 'famous' dish it is a little difficult to decide which aspect of the plate was the best considering the quality of perfectly poached eggs (something even good restaurants tend to overcook,) crisp yet buttery potatoes and lightly herbed juicy pork chop but in the end I think I would have to give the nod to the toast - hand cut thick, rife with seeds and a rich earthiness, and topped with house made preserves featuring what seemed to be no sugar at all but rather the essence of blueberries with a slight savoriness from the rhubarb...a strong contender for best jam/preserves I've ever encountered and reason enough to revisit Matt's when it moves to its new digs a few doors down (and hopefully decreases wait times and seat bumps...and perhaps finds a coffee roaster whose beans better compliment the quality of the food.)\n\n\n\n\n\nGo Early or be prepared to wait!  Smallest restaurant ever.  SUPER good food!  I've tried almost everything on the menu.  I've enjoyed it all.  They also have fresh squeezed juice and rosemary potatoes and an interesting bread when they don't have sourdough.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast!  Best breakfast downtown!  Guy Fieri's been here!!!!!\n\nHold on a minute.... once you get over the hype, unfortunately, you find that Matt's is just average.  We went recently and contended with the customary long wait for our table.  Once seated in the cramped, homey space, we were ready to be dazzled.  Problem is, my griddlecakes were just average.  In fact, the pancakes I make at home (America's Test Kitchen recipe) are probably better.  My daughter's waffle was fine, but again, nothing extraordinary.  Our waitress seemed to always be forgetting something - water, oj, side dish, etc.  For the hassle, Matt's is not worth it.  I'd rather have breakfast at Province in the new Westin down the street.\n\nOnce you get over the hype, you'll get over Matt's.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery disappointed... Nice clean place and very friendly staff, but the food just really isn't that good!  The coffee was weak but flavorful, the OJ was good (freshly squeezed), the wheat toast with preserves was good, the pancake was very plain, the home fries were bland and covered in grease, the pork chop was under seasoned/bland, and the eggs were good but greasy.  Not worth the wait in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here. I've heard great things about this place since I've lived in Arizona. Let's just say, my expectations were exceeded. The bacon and toast are out of this world. Add the simplicity of the menu and the local feel to the place, and you get the best breakfast in the Valley.", "useful": 1.8524137931034483, "cool": 1.0551724137931036, "funny": 0.9089655172413793, "date": "2012-10-04 18:13:20"}, "3": {"business_id": "-092wE7j5HZOogMLAh40zA", "business_name": "Wong's Jr", "address": "8317 W Peoria Ave", "attributes": "{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'Caters': 'True', 'WiFi': \"'no'\", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': \"u'casual'\", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': \"u'quiet'\", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Alcohol': \"'none'\", 'GoodForMeal': \"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}\", 'BikeParking': 'False', 'Ambience': \"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}\", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False'}", "categories": "None", "city": "Peoria", "hours": "{'Monday': '11:0-21:30', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:30', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:30', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:30', 'Friday': '11:0-21:30', 'Saturday': '11:0-21:30', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:30'}", "postal_code": "85345", "review_count": 92, "stars": 3.0, "state": "AZ", "review": "My fiance and I have gotten take out at least 3 or 4 times from this place so far. The food is great and the staff is so friendly. They always give me a few egg rolls free too, which is really nice. The vegetables and meat are always fresh. The fried rice is great. They are also fast! I usually call ahead and can get my food within 10-15 minutes. The combo deals are inexpensive and you get a lot of food.\n\nAs for some of the negative reviews, I don't know what you are talking about! Besides, if you have a problem dealing with someone's accent maybe you shouldn't order Chinese food. :) Just a thought.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is kind of hidden and very quiet, but from the reviews it seems like they've got quite a few patrons! I thought the food was just okay... I've eaten here twice and I admit that the prices are excellent but unfortunately it's not enough to keep me coming back. Staff was pretty friendly, so I thought that was a plus.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like \"wha? really? is this IRL?\" \n\nI'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnimpressed, until I tasted the chow fun, this was the flavor I had been looking for. \n\nBeef Chow Fun:  5 stars \nOther dishes:  3stars\nService: 3 stars\n\nOnce I complimented the chow fun they informed me they have fresh noodles delivered from California once a week, and yes - they do run out sometimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you need a quick cheap bite this is the place! I love their house fried rice and the Singapore noodles!! Yummmmm super delish!! It's also clean and in a decent area! I have been coming here for years and never have had a problem! Love wongs jr!\n\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE this place! I've ordered takeout a few times since moving here from alifornia, and the food is terrific! Love the sweet n sour pork, Lemon chicken and just about everything we've ordered... and when visiting the restaurant, I found it very clean, the employees cheerful and the beer terrific...lol\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here the other day because I was hungry and saw it a few times since I've drove by it and never got to it. Now I wish I didn't go here. The food was not good. I order sesame chicken with white rice. It was not good and very bland. They serve their food on cheap plates and cups that look like it could be from a hospital. Food was not appealing at all. Once I walked in there was only one person there eating. That should have been a warning for me since the restaurant was kind of big but no costumers expect 1 person. \n\nI will never be returning here again unfortunately. The two stars is for the customer service. Very friend people and the restaurant seemed to be very clean. I will be looking for Chinese food else where.\n\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE this place!! \nThe food is always so tasty and the people are pretty nice too. We r always in and out & that's a plus w/ us, b/c we t always STARVING when we go.\n\n We visit often. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nHit or miss but I keep coming back - maybe it is the price or the convenience - not sure.  Either way - if you want affordable chinese with generous portion sizes - this place is for you.,\n\n\n\n\n\nWon't be going here anymore. They got my order wrong and I came back to return it (exchange for my right order since I paid). The manager ephasized I could NEVER do it again and their system logs our information and phone numbers so, if we were to call we wouldn't be allowed a return or exchange. He was rude, said it numerous times over and over how he can't deal with people returning or exchanging the food cause it gets thrown out. Sorry, but I just wanted my CORRECT order and to go home after a long day of work. Talk about crappy  customer service. I normally don't feel the need to write a review as it is my first one, but I'm heavily disappointed since it's a local restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food here is kinda mediocre. Not horrible but just kinda blah. The thing that bothers me is that I have ordered from here several times and they never get my order right. Not the wrong items. It's just never prepared right. If you ask for extra spicy than that's what you should get. Every time. Why allow people to customize their orders if you never prepare the food as asked. They always seem very nice but obviously just don't care. Too bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really enjoy ordering in from this place the people are always friendly. I am in and out of the hospital a lot and everytime I order from these people they always ask how I am doing. They remember if I was sick the last time they saw me and they just seem to care. They even know me & my mom and always ask about her health as well. Not only is the service wonderful the food is really good too and made to order just how I like it minus or plus things I do and do not like. They are always adding those little extra touches I ask for that most places charge you extra for. I really recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've not taken a lot of time to find a solid Chinese restaurant here in Arizona.  My wife and I recently moved to Peoria and this establishment has popped up on my Yelp feed a few times.  We ordered take out because that's how Chinese food should be eaten. \n\nFirst, the entire Grand Ave. x Peoria Ave. exchange is just bizarre and really missed up.  Unfortunately, the restaurant sits kitty corner to Wendy's right on the corner. \n\nWe walked in and the restaurant is very clean.  We were greeted instantly and handed take out menus.  I went with the Spicy Orange Chicken combo and my lovely bride went with the Sweet & Sour Chicken combo.  In less than 10 minutes, our food was produced to us fresh and piping hot. \n\nNext, we got a ton of food.  It's a solid combo guaranteed to put you in an Asian food coma.  For my Spicy Orange Chicken combo, my main entre came with a scoop of fried rice, a solitary piece of fried shrimp, a few pieces of sweet & sour chicken and an egg roll.  That's a lot of food for $10 as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI liked that the orange chicken was spicy as it should be and not caramelized in a candy coating of orange syrup.  The egg roll was delicious as was the piece of fried shrimp I was given.  The few pieces of sweet & sour chicken I was given was also quite tender and flavorful.  The only part of the combo I didn't care for was the fried rice.  That's all it was... fried rice in some shoyu.  No tiny morsels of pork or green onions or carrots or anything.  I love fried rice, but it was bland and sort of lackluster. \n\nIt was still a good experience and they made a great first impression on me.  A solid 4-star contender, indeed!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure of the address, but it's right next to Taco Bell on 83rd and Peoria, across from what used to be the old Wal Mart.  \n\nThis place has been an abandoned Mexican restaurant for the past 4 years, and we just recently noticed signs of life in the form of scrubbing off the graffiti and replacing the awnings.  Last weekend, the boards finally came off the windows and a sign went up to unveil... a Chinese restaurant!  \n\nWhile the name reminds me of something that is decidedly not food, the food inside is pretty solid.  I went there for take out, ordered their version of General Tsos, and got enough food to fill me up for both lunch and dinner that day, and they even threw in a free eggroll! (Might just have been a grand opening special though.)  The chicken was quality (not always the case at Chinese restaurants) and the sauce was good, but not that hot. My only complaint was that they had the weak mustard for the eggroll - I like the stuff that clears out your sinuses.  Maybe if you eat there you get the good stuff.\n\nI wouldn't drive all the way across town for it, but I'm happy they are so close to my house... finally a much better option than Panda!\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty dang good food, 'specially for the area.  I work down the street and after several co-workers told me how good it was I went for a look see.  If you are eating in there isn't much to get excited about besides the plasma TV on the back wall with ESPN news constantly running with no volume.  There is also no music or other background music, to me it felt a little weird, like I was eating at the library.  \n\nThe food is very tasty.  Their chicken is all white meat which is very rare for an Asian food establishment, especially when they aren't charging extra for it. The spiciness can be adjusted to taste, from warm to sweat pouring into my eyes hot. \n\nLunch specials are filling with rice, entree, egg roll, and crab puff.  Dinner portions are sized up and again, very filling. Several vegetarian and health aware items on the menu. \n\nThey deliver to a pretty large area, and staff are friendly.  If you work or live in the area, support them as it would be a shame to see them go out of business.\n\n\n\n\n\nI normally like to write up a storm. But I'm gonna try my best to keep this brief because time is money, and Wong's Jr. is not worth the money. This restaurant just struck me as cheap. Simple as that. The price itself wasn't too bad; I paid $10 total. But it felt like Wong's Jr. cut every corner imaginable. It was one of the most lackluster Chinese restaurants I have ever been to.\n\nI had Szechuan Vegetables (\"extra spicy\") and Hot and Sour Soup. The Szechuan Vegetables were loaded with \"cheap\" vegetables - water chestnuts, carrots, onions, celery and green peppers. I don't have any problem with any of these vegetables in particular, but it's very telling that they are all \"cheaper\" vegetables. It felt like an insult. Like the restaurant was saying \"Oh, you want vegetables? Sure, let's give you the cheapest vegetables possible!\" \n\nWhere was the broccoli or the green beans? Wong's Jr. was too cheap to include them. The sauce was watery and weak. I was hoping for a thicker and more satisfying sauce. Don't get me wrong; it's not like it tasted bad or anything. But it was very unexciting and not worth buying.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hot and Sour Soup was plain and bare bones. Also very unexciting. The White Rice was below average and a poor complement to the main dish. My meal was served to me in a box that was cut in half. Way to cut corners by not having to buy plastic bags!\n\nI could go on about the depressing atmosphere and bash the restaurant some more, but I really don't need to. Wong's Jr. was just very lackluster. The food itself wasn't bad, but quite noticeably below average. Below average simply doesn't cut it in 2016. It might have worked in the past, but with all the amazing food options available today, a restaurant must go above and beyond. This is a disappointment.\n\nFor its below average service and food, Wong's Jr. gets 2 stars. It's certainly not the worst restaurant I have ever been to, but I have been to so much better. Wong's Jr. is not worth your time. Avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is my favorite Chinese food place within about 5 miles.\n\nThe staff is friendly though the best English-speakers in the place are a still a little hard to understand.\n\nThe prices, speed and portions are about average and the food is very good.\n\nI actually like the location and styling of the building.  Its right next to a taco bell and looks like it might have used to be a KFC or something.  The building looks better inside and out than almost all Chinese food restaurants nearby.\n\n\n\n\n\nGot take out tonight. Wow this place is the worst Chinese food I have ever had! Ordered Vegetable Crispy Chow Mien which turned out to be a box of spouts and celery with a handful of Crispy Noodles from a can. Also asked for extra spicy Orange Chicken which was very runny and all breading. I think the only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and stale fortune cookie. I don't recommend this place to anyone. (I don't like Panda Express either, so don't think I am that type of food person.)\n\nBTW... My fortune cookie taught me \"ce sou\" which is Chinese for RESTROOM and is where I will be after trying this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nCouldnt wait to enjoy a great lunch here, the food is always amazing, but my plans for that were abrubtly cut short when a waiter, a white man in his 50s with a grey beard took it upon himself to SHOW ME PORNOGRAPHY on his phone that he thought somehow pertained to a previous conversation about corvettes we had just a few minutes before? IN FRONT OF MY GIRLFRIEND no less. This is absolutely unprofessional behavior and borderline sexual harassment, at no point did i indicate that i wished to see pornographic material from the phone of an employee of wong jrs and insane to assume that is something i care to see at lunch with my girlfriend. My professional advice to management is to fire the employee in question by close of business TODAY.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service here really good and place very clean. They made me feel very welcome and at home. I really appreciated their hospitality. I would recommend this place. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken didn't taste very fresh... That was chicken right???????...\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is great.  Portions are modest and flavor is spot on.  Take out and dine both offer great experiences.  I will agree that the dining in experience is a little quiet, no music no TV's.  This part though I have decided I like.  The staff are very, very friendly.  This resteraunt has become my chinese resteraunt of choice over Changs.  Food is equal if not better, Wait Staff is Friendlier, Price point is unbeatable.  \n\nThis location will only get better as it ages.\n\n\n\n\n\nOmgosh this place is so so good. The food is delicious! And the staff is so friendly and they honestly appreciate their customers. I've been coming here for the past year, and I've never had a bad experience. Definitely try the spicy orange chicken especially for lunch, they have awesome lunch and dinner specials.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went there again tonight ....as usual EVERYTHING was great . We each had a dinner combo + side I should have just stuck with the side as the portions were huge\n...I should have know better as we eat there at least twice a month \nOne of the reasons is besides great  food they don't mind substitutions as we don't eat any seafood or peanuts ...no problem\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place . We have been there 5 or 6 times now I try something different each time ..everything has been great It is all fresh, fast and hot  AND BEER TO\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm originally from New York, and spend my summers in Vegas.  Needless to say this has made me very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine.  This is easily the best inexpensive Chinese food I have ever had.  I normally get the same thing, but I have branched out here and there and have never been disappointed.  \n\nIt's very unassuming and unfortunately not visible from Grand, so I am worried about it's survival.  That's why I decided to write my very first review singing it's praises.\n\nThe waitstaff is friendly and attentive, and as I've said the food is fantastic.\n\nAlmost everytime I go in I get the House Chicken lunch special and an order of potstickers.  Both are incredible and I highly recommend them.  Please try this place out as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed!\n\n\n\n\n\nTonight was the first time we ordered from wongs and the food tastes as nasty as the name!!! Anyone who says that they have good food must habe been raused on ramen noodles because not only did this food make me and my two kids ill, but it wad also garbage quality!\nWe had two bites of our meal before throwing it back in the box. I got ill almost instantly and when I called them, there \"manager\" was so rude and unprofessional, he told me that I need to go to the hospital and have the food tested and bring a doctors note to prove there fiod made us sick. \nThe quality of food is disgusting, as is the service. I should have listened to my instinct and not gotten food their as they are oporating out of an old building that was previously condemned!!! Lesson learned!\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered delivery for the first time. Was pleasantly surprised. The food was tasty and still hot. Got to us within 40 minutes. They were very polite when taking the order. 4 stars because the sweet and sour sauce given on the side was a little runny for my liking. .  I ordered the beef chop suey combo b. It was very good. Came with fried rice , sweet and sour chicken , egg roll and a fried shrimp.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really hate to do this, but I just can't say anything good about Wong's Jr.  I ordered Take Out last weekend from here, and I was really hoping this place would be good.  Sad to say, it wasn't.  We had 'Spicy' Orange Chicken, Shrimp Chowmein, and Egg Rolls.  The Chicken wasn't spicy at all.  Whatever kick was in it must have been forgotten to be added.  As for the Chowmein, it was terrible.  Sprouts and celery sitr-fried with a bag of canned crispy noodles.  The Egg Rolls were 'meh' at best, and the rice....well, it was just white rice.  I am not really sure what's going on here, but it appears that people either love this place or hate it.  For those who love it, I wonder if you have ever had really good Chinese before.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible service. Have eaten there before and food was fine, not stellar. This time I ordered food to go for our fun and non traditional Christmas dinner. I had a issue with my debit card. They didn't accept other forms of payment that I had available, totally understandable. I asked if they could accept a family member debit card over the phone, and start the order while I ran home to get the new card and family member (so they could see it was really a valid card that we legally possessed).  They refused the over the phone card and refused to start the order until I returned with the actual card. I was so annoyed I just walked out.  If I had called from home first, they would have accepted payment that way and started the order. The logic behind making me wait longer when my travel time there and back  baffles me. There would have been plenty of time for the food to be cooked so  I could have just popped in and out without taking up space in their waiting area. And I wouldn't have had to waste any more of my own time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome food, great service, good value, great selection, and super fast delivery (granted I live less than two miles away). Nothing to complain about.\n\n\n\n\n\nBad food no flavor at all... Very disappointedAnd very Expensive... For cold  flavorless food. Think twice before ordering from here..\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good and fast service..I would have gave it 4 stars but the location kind of sucks. There is a $15 miminum order for delivery. Good food overall, no complaints!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ordered take out. They were here within a timely manner. My egg rolls were ok...just tasted old.   The sweet and sour sauce was the worst. I LOVE chinese and love sweet and sour sauce. First off, it smelled like sweet and sour sauce mixed with puke. I'm not kidding. I wouldnt say that to be mean, it is LITERALLY what it smelled like. We liked the crab puffs...just didnt have anything GOOD to dip them in. We both ordered teriyaki combo plates, and pork fried rice as well. Rice was ok...not much flavor. Hub never even got to his teriyaki last night....bad thing is, I did. I had probably about 5 bites before I put it in the fridge for tomorrow. It was the only thing I ate that hub didnt. I was up ALL NIGHT long in the bathroom. Sick as a dog. The teriyaki meals are still in my fridge and I plan to call about it.  ( JUST CALLED THE PLACE) spoke with the manager. I asked for a refund on just my two meals that wouldve totalled less that $15.  My order including tip- I even tipped 8 dollars!- was $38.   I've lived in peoria all 28 years of my life, and order from this place quite frequently. I have never asked for a refund or complained before. Usually they are our GO TO for chinese take out.  Guy said no, beccause people can eat, get full,and then call for refund.    ONe of my meals had like 5 bites taken out of it (that's what got me sick) and hub didnt even touch his yet, he put it in the fridge and was saving it for today......SO I OFFERED to take the food back to them.  He said no again. I asked for higher up and than him and he said there was no higher....just the owner. I asked for the owner's info or to give him my info for contact and he refused!  He said the owner would think it was silly and would laugh at him for not being able to handle it.   I said, ok, then why isnt this handled?   He again refused to take my info and then hung up on me.   I told him I write reviews and would post to the BBB- I wanted to speak with the owner. Im not some cheapy trying to get my money back.  I have a house, two vehicles, and a small business. $15 isnt anything but principal at this point. Your food made someone sick.  I didnt ask for a full refund and I tipped MORE than what is adequate.  I WAS a good customer and now they have lost our business.            Today is mother's day. Last night we ordered take out cause my inlaws just took the kids for the night. It was my relax night....and I ended up in the bathroom all night long- and feeling like crap this morning.     My review and issue is on to the BBB next, and any place else I can post about it.    It's just not right!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ordered BBQ ribs and there was no sauce on the ribs, my rice was stale and the sesame chicken was equivalent to a wet soggy puffy chicken nugget....NEVER AGAIN!!!!! We called to let them know and they not accept responsibility or accountability. Order Hungry Howie's instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is really good! What sold is on this place is that they offer truly gluten free food that is not twice the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nWong's Jr is inexpensive and the food tastes ok, but I have had better. We got a take out order with Ma Po Tofu and some Almond Chicken. The Ma Po Tofu was strange since there is usually tofu and pork in a spicy sauce at other restaurants but at Wong's Jr there is only tofu and vegetables - it tasted ok but just seemed strange without the pork. Maybe it was their way to keep the dish vegetarian, but not what I expected. The almond chicken was also just ok. There were a bunch of diced vegetables with some pieces of chicken in a watery sauce that had almonds in it. The sauces with the meals were so watery that the takeout boxes became weak and flimsy by the time I drove home. Luckily, everything was double bagged with plastic. \n\nI would get food from there again if I was hungry and didn't feel like anything else since they are cheap and have pretty good hours - open pretty late and everyday including holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally a good Chinese spot!!  Low Mein heaven, bbq pork yum, beef chow fun GREAT, BOMB DIGGITY sweet and sour pork, GREAT egg rolls, very good crab puffs!!  Not so good house chicken, I will not order the orange chicken from here again, they need a total rework of their recipe.  I was so impressed with the other things though that I will return again and again!!\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo stars for service and cleanliness... The food- two thumbs down. \nAs soon as I walked in a was greeted by an incredibly kind gentleman, he offered me a menu and I placed my order. All of the people I interacted with were very pleasant and helpful. \nThe restaurant was very clean and had decent decor.\nIf it were based on service and cleanliness alone, I'd be back for sure. However the food was bland. I had the beef lo mein, my usual choice. Bland, bland, bland. So I took a few bites off my husband's \"spicy\" orange chicken.. It wasn't spicy at all. Again bland, boring, and we probably could have had more flavor from panda.\nYes, it was that bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was looking for a Chinese place in the area for lunch. Found this on Yelp & decided to give it a try. I ordered the walnut shrimp and it was fast and delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. We haven't been here in several years. \nWong's Jr is still really good. We ordered off of the lunch menu. We ordered the egg flower soup as soup comes with the lunch special. \nMy husband ordered the Schezwan pork with steamed white rice and I ordered the shrimp with snow peas and steamed white rice. We both had hot green teas as well. \nThe food was hot, fresh and delicious. The pork was tender. The shrimp was in a thick creamy sauce. The vegetables were crisp. Every bite was like a party in my mouth--it all joined together in a flavorful mix of flavors.\nThe restaurant is clean the restrooms are clean.\nThe waiter and waitress were very prompt and attentive. They were friendly and they removed our dishes promptly. \nParking is plentiful. \nWe will definitely be returning in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter than Panda Express and cheaper than Pei Wei!!! \n\nI have turned everyone in my family on to this place and all of my friends to Wong's Jr. I discovered them a few years ago when they first opened and I got a door hanger with their delivery menu as well as coupons! Call me a sucker for free egg rolls, but that was the coupon the hooked me in to ordering. Three years later I am still hooked on the food. \n\nThe sweet and sour pork/chicken is cooked to a crispy golden brown perfection. When you order them to go (delivery or pick-up) they pack them in the container minus the sauce. The only complaint that I have is that I wish that they would pack more of the veggie mix (carrots, onions, etc.) inside of the container. I believe that the sauce is made fresh because there have a few times were the sauce was either a little more sweet or sour than the previous experience. \n\nThe egg rolls are made fresh and again, they can vary from visit to visit in flavor, but they are always yummy. The Egg Flower soup is the perfect pick me up on a cold day, when you're feeling down, or just because you want something light and filling. More than once, I have had a container of soup and a bag of fried won ton chips for dinner, and been perfectly happy.\n\nIt's a little off the beaten path and you have to look for the place in order not pass it up, but it is TOTALLY worth the effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast minute decision, tried eat24 and only one Chinese restaurant that I found to be less then good. After a simple google search I found this place so I called, lady on the phone was super friendly so I placed my order with no issues, 2 teriyaki, 1 orange chicken and 2 egg rolls, plus she threw in 2 more no charge. I ordered extra rice because I know typically these places dont give enough, I later learned that was totally not necessary. I barely had enough time to get things set for dinner change for bed and it was here, super quick. Finally I figured everything was going too good however the delivery guy was super friendly and the food was AWESOME, oh and I thought all the rice even the extra was in one large container, no, there was a separate one. I will definitely be ordering from these guys again!\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were very fast and friendly. But I can't get past how awful their food was. Their food was over cooked and had no flavor. The rice was dry and some of it was even crunchy, the chicken had two different colors (some was a dull white & other pieces looked like beef). Their egg rolls were disgusting. Definitely will not be ordering from them again.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir service is awesome! Delivery guys are personable and polite. They have good coupons and great food!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent at noon and  the entire restaurant was empty.  Place looked deserted, but we were greeted rather quickly by a nice woman who showed us to our seat. \n\nI ordered spicy orange chicken. It came out  quickly, but that's kind of expected when there's no other patrons. The food was extremely bland.  In fact, I ate only 3 bites and couldn't bring myself to eat anymore. \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be recommending this place to anyone anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have the same selections as all the other chinese places...except they all taste better! We have been going here for the last two years and they are consistently awesome! Great food and they always end up giving us free eggrolls with our order. FREE EGGROLLS! I love this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really like this place!  Pretty standard Chinese takeout fare but the food is consistently well prepared and the staff is always friendly.  Delivery time isn't very consistent(as quick as 15 minutes to as long as an hour), but it seems like they wait to get your order together until they've got a driver ready.  Never cold or seems as if it's been sitting around.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwice Cooked Crispy Pork was not crispy or good. Just some soggy breaded pork slathered in too much sauce. Chicken with garlic sauce was bland. Fried rice was just steamed rice covered in soy sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice place, clean, friendly greeting.\n\nLunch specials were good. Pretty standard stuff. Egg soup was a bit boring, but I'm not a fan of egg soup. Crab puff and eggroll and fried rice were the sides and all were good. Main courses were large enough that we both had more than we could finish.\n\nGood selection of dishes and they serve beer too.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband & I have been going to Wong Jr. since it opened & always enjoyed the food, customer service & cleanliness of the restaurant. \nRecently we've noticed a change in the taste of their food; bland, just not consistent any longer. Tonight I thought we'd give them another try, unfortunately the egg rolls were greasy & soggy inside, the Singapore rice noodle dish was bland & partially cold. I won't be returning any time soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been going here since they first opened. The food is ok for the price, but it seems like over time some of the quality went down (only on certain items). I used to eat here 2-3 times a week but I started to cut back after I got a bit burnt out (it's pretty cheap and it takes like 10 mins to be done and I'm home in 3). When I started eating there again (a few months later) I noticed that every 2-3 times I've ordered from there I get sick. I still order from here, but on a much less frequent basis, such as once or twice a month. I just know that there's a chance of getting sick, so I don't eat there as often.\n\n\n\n\n\nCome here for take out all the time. Never had any bad dishes. I pass several Chinese restaurants to get to Wong's Jr. They are my go to place.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome food! Their walnut shrimp is addicting. They are always fast, courteous, and my food is always super fresh. The staff is awesome, always really kind.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't judge a book by its cover - the outside looks like any other hole in the wall, low-quality, crap place.  The inside is so much different - very cozy and the staff is super nice!\n\nI got the spicy orange chicken lunch combo which came with an egg roll, crab puff, and fried rice, all for just $4.50!  I'm not a huge fan of lots of breading on my meat so I was thrilled that there is a pretty minimal amount of breading on this dish.  My husband ordered the kung pao chicken which came with the same sides.  This was also very tasty and we were both amazed at how fresh and crisp the vegetables were, almost like they add them near the end of the cooking process.\n\nOverall, best Chinese takeout I've ever had and they delivery too!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is literally the only place my boyfriend and I order from for Chinese food.\n\nWe probably get delivery from Wongs once a week, and the delivery guy remembers us every time!  There was a weekend we didn't order because we were out of town.  The next weekend when we did order, the delivery guy said, \"we didn't hear from you guys last weekend!\"  Haha!  They're always really fast; 20 minutes from the time we call to the time they're at the door is average.  Always!\n\nThe food here is amazing.  I would figure that their prices should be way more considering the AMOUNT of food you get.  We always have leftovers (and everyone knows leftover chinese is even better the next day.)  I'm also a very picky eater and they've never given me grief when I've asked for substitutions, nor have they ever messed up an order.  Plus, they'll give you complimentary egg rolls!\n\nAs far as the restaurant itself goes?  It's ghetto looking on the outside!  Last time we drove by there was graffiti on it I believe.  They're slowly but surely making it look more maintained (working neon signs, signs in their windows, etc.) but, whew.  Don't let that hold you back.  You step inside and it's got a flat screen TV usually with some sports event on.  Many tables/booths.  They also sell home made jewlery in the restaurant which is different.  Very clean and maintained.  Professional and friendly staff.  They also serve alcohol in the restaurant!\n\nSo, yes...love Wongs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is horrible. Our fried rice was burnt. Egg rolls were soggy and undercooked. The chicken was slimy. This place is disgusting.  We have ordered twice and both times it was the same way. Do not waste your money on bad Chinese food.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am so upset with myself for forgetting about this place for so long. Tonight I rediscoved the wonderful flavors of great delivery food. The staff is always friendly and accomodating to my picky needs without compliant or frustration and I appreciate that. My mouth watered from the flavorful chowmain and the crispy fried shrimp I ordered tonight. I was very happy with the food and service as always. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat lunch specials! Had the sweet/sour shrimp and my guest tried the sweet/sour pork.  Each came with fried rice, choice of egg drop or hot/sour soup (he got egg drop, I tried the hot/sour, which was fabulous) and a crab puff.  We also ordered appetizers of crab puffs and potstickers.  The crab puffs were really cheesy, but with extra sweet/sour, who cares?!  The potstickers came with a wonderful soy-ish sauce that my guest added to his fried rice.  The overall meal was delicious!  We will be back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to stop in before going to work today... Gotta say that I'm so glad we did!!  Looking at the place from the outside does not prepare you at all for what you get on the inside.  Wongs is very tastefully decorated and so, so clean.  We got nothing but smiles from the prompt and friendly staff... Everyone there was staying busy the entire visit, from spot cleaning to folding menus.  Let's get into what's really important though... The food!!!!  We started our meal with Crab Rangoon and Beef Skewers... Just amazing.  The Rangoon was light and crispy, the filling just right; while the Skewers were juicy and tender with just the right flavor.  After that we both went for dinner combos.  I went for the pepper steak which was served with egg drop soup, sweet and sour chicken, an egg roll, and fried rice.  The chicken was delectable, super crispy and flavorful... Pepper steak was just right, fried shrimp was yummy, and fried rice had a great taste.  Egg roll was a bit too cooked for me, but just right for my boyfriend.  The only difference in his combo was the spicy orange chicken which he LOVED.  Neither of us had anything bad at all to say about the soup... In short, best Chinese food I've ever had.  We will be going back very often!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat neighborhood Chinese take out place. We first ordered because we were lazy. Delivery is fast (they always quote 45 minutes; food arrives in 20-30 minutes). We order once or twice a week, and the food never disappoints. The crab puffs and kung pao are my favorites.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy delivery order took over 70 minutes to arrive and then the taste was just OK. won't order again. sweet and sour chicken, Teriyaki chicken, chicken egg foo young, eggs rolls. ..\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered take out from Wong's Jr last night for the first time and was surprizingly pleased.  You see, I'm a recent transplant from NY and I'm a bit of a sceptic when it comes to food out here.  I had gotten home late, wasn't thrilled with anything in the house, and didn't feel like going out again, so I decided on take-out.  I had been getting take out menus left on my door for months, so I decided to give it a shot.  They have a very large delivery area.  When I called, as soon as I told them it would be for delivery, they warned me that it may be an hour or so before it got to me.  That actually fit in well to my plans so I still went for it.  I ordered Mongolian Beef, Chicken and Broccoli and Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Everything was absolutely dee-lish!  He even threw in 2 eggrolls!  They gave me plenty of sauces and fortune cookies (sometimes they're a little skimpy on these).  The portions were overflowing from the containers.  Plenty of food for the price.  And... the delivery came in only 45 minutes. The man making the delivery found my apartment with no problems and was very pleasant and very appreciative of my tip.  Will most definately order again!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was not good at all. The food was cold and stale. The fried rice was burnt, not sure how that is possible, but it was. The crab puffs and soup was actually very good. I was very disappointed and had to ask for money back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely will NEVER RETURN. The staff pays more attention to each other, speaking in a foreign language, then they do taking my order correctly. Making sure that my order is correct was not a priority to the staff. Living 20 miles away from this restaurant made it a hindrance when I called to complain. The woman on the phone was yelling at me which, is poor customer service. She advised for me to come back to the restaurant, which is 20 miles away, to pick up the items that were missing and what was cooked in correctly. I have never been treated this poorly from a Chinese restaurant. The floor was dirty and the bathrooms were not clean. I did not eat the food since it was cooked incorrectly. This was a waste of money and, a waste of time. Instead of being happy with my food, I am now hungry and angry. This is one customer that will never support their restaurant again.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill lovin the lo mein and sweet and sour pork!! EGG ROLL HEAVEN with the mustard!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nmeh. it's alright...I ordered and had it delivered. We ordered two entrees and the second entree didn't come with rice (when it's suppose to). \n\nI'm willing to give it a second shot, but I've had better Chinese food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMundane food, poorly seasoned, long wait for delivery\n\nBeing hungry and desiring some comfort food, I was excited to see twice cooked pork. My husband warned me that it wouldn't be right since this was a fast food Chinese place. None the less we ordered it along with Beijing style hot and spicy chicken, BBQ ribs, and Hot and sour soup.\n\nThe verdict: Only the steamed rice was edible!\n\nTwice cooked pork is sliced pork that is boiled then stir fried w the sauce. What I got was pork coated in breading then drenched in not spicy sauce with maybe 5 pieces of pepper, 2 pieces of onion, 2 pieces of carrot, and 3 inedible whole chilli peppers. If you're into this type of nonsense, they do pack a full cartoon.\n\nThe Beijing style hot and spicy chicken looked just like the pork! Only this sauce was just like an orange sauce and not spicy.\n\nBBQ ribs: They were decent size but lacked BBQ sauce! They had the typically Chinese pink stuff but don't call something BBQ without a proper rub or sauce. They were greasy, but less chewy than others we have tried. \n\nHot and sour soup: Terrible. Not sour. Not spicy. Tastes bland with no texture whatsoever. I'm beginning to think that Arizona has no good Hot and Sour Soup.\n\nDelivery: Took over an hour for delivery despite living 10 minutes away. In my book, that's unacceptable.\n\nI would not choose to eat from this place ever again. Nor would I ever order any of the items above.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not a fan of Chinese food in general, but this place is just not very good. My wife, who loves Chinese food herself agreed that my Teriyaki Chicken was not made properly. It was tasteless and such a waste of food as I threw away more than half of it. They do give you large portions here, but the food is not good enough for that to matter. I wouldn't recommend this place and don't think I will order from here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered dinner from this restaurant for three people. Food arrived 45 minutes later cold. called and ask for the manager he wasn't there waited awhile for him to call back finally we called back he refused to refund our money. We told him we were never going there again. No excuse for cold food. He said they were busy that was his excuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nI celebrate pretty much all special occasions with Chinese food. It's delicious, usually cheap, and there are endless menu options to choose from (although, let's face it, I'll judge you by the quality of your lo mein). So when I first moved to Phoenix, I immediately began a search for delicious Chinese food somewhere near my house. \n\nBelieve it or not, it took more than a YEAR to find a place that was't truly awful.\n\nWong's Jr is a delicious island floating in a desolate sea (desert?) of terrible Chinese food. I tried Chinese places up and down the length of Bell Road, all the way down to Glendale and up to Happy Valley. It took a long time and a lot of heartbreak, but Yelp finally led us to wonderful Wong's Jr - truly, it was love at first taste. The service here is always super friendly, professional, and fast. Their dinner specials are fabulous -  they come with rice, an egg roll, a crab puff, and either sweet and sour chicken or what they call BBQ chicken (it's no bbq I recognize, but it's definitely delicious!). The ton of food they give you is always piping hot, and the quality never varies. Sometimes they'll even throw in free egg rolls, if you order a lot.  I have a hard time straying from the lo mein, and Andy F adores the sesame chicken, but everything else we tried was just as good. This place is a real gem, and one I recommend to everyone disappointed in Phoenix's Chinese food offerings. \n\nWong's Jr, we miss you already!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood, clean, neighborhood Chinese restaurant. Food is always cooked well, service is great and the place always looks very clean. I find the food better than big heng and Bo Bo china which are also by my house.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dined in here the other day for lunch and Sad to say but Panda Express is better than what I ate. For $6.50 I had hot and sour soup and it wasn't even spicy.  Spicy orange chicken had barely any flavor on it and not spicy\nThe rice was I don't even know what kind of rice it was but it was kind of spongy , the egg roll  was fine but my food wasn't even hot. Fried wontons tasted like soap.The Dr. Pepper was not even flavorful. Highly disappointed and not worth my money.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove a good quick lunch something other than panda.. Food is always fresh & have never had a complaint. I'm a creature of habit but I do love the hot & sour soup & the spicy Kung pao chicken & shrimp. Priced very well for lunch. Do not prefer the dinner pricing however, delivery is always quick & good & am able to relax..\n\n\n\n\n\nYour basic Chinese food, best had via delivery.  The thing is they have good nights (most of the time), and not so good nights (sometimes), so consistency of quality could be better.  Portions and prices are pretty good, though.  They usually get the orders right, but a couple times when they didn't, they just argued and refused to make it right.  the thing I would complain about is if you get chicken ANYTHING, make sure you pay extra for white meat, otherwise you get dark meat and tendons.  I'd recommend them, if you are close by, and need a Chinese food delivery in your area.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlenty of food for the price! I went for dinner tonight after reading other good reviews. The place was clean and the service was fast and friendly. English was good too.\n\nFor my appetizer I ordered the crab puffs. They were really good. Lots of filling and flavor! One of my favorites there for sure. I got six of them for less than three dollars!\n\nI had the dinner combination #7 which included a choice of one entree and came with fried rice, one egg roll, sweet and sour chicken, and choice of soup. I had the egg drop soup. \n\nMy dinner came to me in a timely manner and was just what I ordered. I chose the spicy orange chicken for my entree. The orange chicken was just spicy enough, but not too hot to eat. It had a thin breading on it which I really liked. The sweet and sour chicken had a thicker breading which I wasn't too fond of, but tasted good anyway. Next time I'll just get the orange chicken dinner. The fried rice was a brown rice if I'm not mistaken and was kinda plain, without any vegetables or egg so I spiced it up with some soy. The egg roll was a little over done on the outside and full of flavor on the inside.\n\nThere are not very many Chinese restaurants to choose between in my area of the valley and most of them are too expensive and lack good flavor. I'll be going back Wong's Jr again many more times in the future for sure! Another favorite would be China Grill. ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant is near my work on the westside.  I stopped in for lunch and was pleased with the prices, portions, and selection on the menu.  I had the Chicken Lo Mein combo which had good flavor and the noodles were cooked well.  Wasn't a huge fan of their fried rice or egg rolls though as both were a tad dry.  I'll try them out again though as I'm always looking for lunch options.\n\n\n\n\n\nToo bad the food is good because we will never go again. They are rude, mean and horrible. The guy who was there was terrible to his employee in front of us and my brother had to say something. We will never eat there again because of his horrible attitude. He was more concerned about the people on the phone then with our order. People who ordered the food after us got their food first! Wth?!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Wongs Jr.! The food is great, portions are great and the price is just right! We love their spring rolls and crab puffs!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been eating there since they've opened about 4 years ago. It's in an old Kenny Rogers roasters building.  They're down the street from BoBo.  The food is comparable.\nThey service here is no nonsense and not as friendly as BoBo, but its much larger and they offer Mushu and other dishes not carried by BoBo.\nThey also do carryout and delivery.\nWhat I like about Wong Jr, maybe because I'm a regular, they allow me to have the smaller portioned lunch combo and price even when we are a few minutes past the cutoff time.\nThey offer hot and sour soup and no just egg drop on the lunch combo. Which comes with both a egg roll and crab puff.  I call it a mystery crab puff, because I've yet to find any crab, even imitation crab in the cream cheese!\nMy son really likes them and he gladly receives them from his sisters.\nI like Mushu, but like most Chinese restaurants in town, use the thin flour tortilla style commercial crepe, instead of a fresh made egg crepe.\nIf you don't like an ingredient, or more of one and less of another, or substitute, they will customize you dish.  Sometimes there is a slight charge for the service ($1, but could be more or free).\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Delivery about 2 times a week always hot n fresh. great flavors great service, really fast delivery to. I live in a gated apartment complex and there is never any trouble. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for familiar fast asain style food. great egg rolls,pot stickers and love the shrimp lo mein!!!\n\n\nTim\n\n\n\n\n\nReally bad Chinese food. I ordered egg rolls, kung pao chicken and shrimp chow fun Everything was really bland, not even lots of soy sauce made it better. Nothing tasted bad, it just didn't have any flavor. The noodles were greasy, and had a weird texture. The filling on the egg rolls did as well. \n\nThe delivery was prompt, and the delivery driver was polite, but the food was so bad, I wouldn't order from Wong Jr's again.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoo Goo Gai Pan and three Tsingtao beers! - What could be better!  \nOn several occasions, right after my 12-hour work shifts, I felt like having some Asian food nights! This was the place to be! The service has been fast and efficient! The plentiful amount of food has constantly filled my rather large stomach. The best part of the evening was that I was also able to top it off with some nice tasting, imported Chinese beer (Tsingtao).\nOn one of the occasions I even met Mr. Wong, Jr. himself! (at least I think I spoke with him!) All in all, the last three times I've been to the establishment, the service has been great, the food tasted quite good and I had a great time! The restaurant also has a booming \"To-Go\" business. The clientele were constantly contacting the restaurant staff, ordering their food, and in a few short minutes, were running in and picking up the waiting delicacies. \nI enjoyed my visits.  I'll be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family has come to this restaurants since my kids were little.  Now I bring my grandkids here.  We have never been dissapointed.  Everything from scratch.  Love it.  Wong chicken is awesome spicy or non spicy.  The will cook either way.  Crazy good food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife & I come here at least once a week for lunch. Their lunch specials are our favorite: $5. Iced Tea is good as well.\nI just had sweet & sour chicken (which was good), but it was overcooked. When Ray is waiting tables, it is much more enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\n\nI can't speak to the dining experience in the restaurant as my husband and I have only ordered delivery regularly over the last three years.  We have nothing but good things to say, our order is always correct, the prices are reasonable, the food is consistently hot and fresh, and the delivery is fast, even on busy delivery days!  We won't order from anywhere else while Wong's delivers to us.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been eating here since the week it opened. It is going down in quality. Y last and i mean last order was bitter because the grease was not fresh on fried food. It was delivery but manager made me drive back, and than told me two of the plates were eaten out of, maybe a third, so he only refunded one. We ordered three. For a known and faithful customer i was treated like arbage, and that is how my LAST meal there tasted as well. I still have the nasty after taste in my mouth. Yes, iam upset, but this used to be my favorite place for chinese food, and when it goes fromfavorite to returning food, something is wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat house fried rice and best egg rolls in the valley. People are real friendly. Low prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery disappointed,  ! Wongs Chicken tasted like it was a week old.  Egg fu young had no flavor.  The hot and sour soup was barely OK.\n\n\n\n\n\nShitty location, hard to find. \n\nRough being right down the road from big heng but they make it work\n\nA+ food every dish I have had was very good. Polite waiters and clean inside. My only complaint is that the water and tea is really really gross. Im not sure why. \n\nOverall I love it though\n\n\n\n\n\nGood chinese delivery.  Wonton soup was great.  Rice / chicken / sauce : pretty good stuff, nothing fantastic or awful to speak of\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if they read their reviews or not but they should. This was shockingly bad. The teriyaki chicken literally had no sauce.. never seen anything like it.  The house chicken is aptly named because it tasted like drywall.  Zero flavor.  I have no idea how this place is in business.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I have ordered take out from Wongs 3 times and each time it's been really good.  I've definitely had better Chinese food but this place always satisfies my chinese craving.\n\nWe order the same thing every time.  \nEgg Rolls\nCrab Puffs\nVegetable LoMein\nGeneral Tso's Chicken\n\nThe Egg Rolls are my least favorite.  But they are still good...the outer layer is too thick for me.  The inside is good though.  Good flavor.\nCrab puffs are really good.  There's nothing amazing about them but there isn't much to crab puffs so they are what they are.  They're crispy and well cooked.\nVegetable LoMein is awesome.  The noodles are always perfectly cooked and the flavors are great.  The vegetables always seem fresh and taste good.  \nGeneral Tso's is a good flavor.  The chicken is lightly breaded and cooked well.  The only thing I would add is a little spice.  It's very mild.  \n\nIt's not the best chinese but it's the best I've found in this area.  Give it a try.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't judge a book by its cover - the outside looks like any other hole in the wall, low-quality, crap place.  The inside is so much different - very cozy and the staff is super nice!\n\nI got the spicy orange chicken lunch combo which came with an egg roll, crab puff, and fried rice, all for just $4.50!  I'm not a huge fan of lots of breading on my meat so I was thrilled that there is a pretty minimal amount of breading on this dish.  My husband ordered the kung pao chicken which came with the same sides.  This was also very tasty and we were both amazed at how fresh and crisp the vegetables were, almost like they add them near the end of the cooking process.\n\nOverall, best Chinese takeout I've ever had and they delivery too!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place. The people that work there are so polite and totally cool at the same time. Dont be fooled by the deserted feeling when you forst walk in, the food is amaizing. I literally come here insted of the Chinese restaurant by my house because their crab puffs are out of this world! Not to mention I usually order Singapore rice noodles and this place is on point. All hail Wong Jr!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I usually love this place & recommend it to everyone. Not anymore! THEY FUCKED UP! It was delivery. There was a piece of metal like from a steel wool scrubber in the garlic sauce chicken and the wings my brother in law had were so bad he spit them out! He said they smelt like BUTTHOLE. Wayne the manager said \"oh yeah that happens we clean with those\" as if it's a normal thing and metal is usually in the food. The wings he said others had ate them in the restaurant and nothing was wrong with their order as if we were making it up. I could've had a stomach lesion or ulcer from swallowing the metal. Luckily, I felt it before I spit it out. My brother in law is not a picky man so for him to spit it out that means bad business. They should've thrown those wings out. It was old meat! They wanted to give me a CREDIT for the garlic sauce chicken only NOT the wings! I told Wayne we were too grossed out to go back there & wanted a refund. He said no they won't refund it unless we take them the food & I told them why can't the delivery driver come back & he said no it was too busy. NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN! ZERO STARS!\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good Chinese food at a good price. Nothing is amazing but good quality food at a decent price. We come here at least once a month.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love love love this place!! Always great food and delivery service ty!! Can't wait for our next order . Crab wontons are usually.free with our order to\n\n\n\n\n\nPleasantly surprised. Ordered from a menu left on my front door, so I wasn't sure what to expect, being as its in the same parking lot as a Taco Bell.

Mine was pepperoni and pineapple and my partner's was bacon & ham.   I can't think of any pizza that's tasted this bad.   Worse than Hungry Howies.   And Little Ceasars is a gourmet pizza in comparison. \n\nThe pizzas arrived at the door in good time.   I tried to eat mine,  but the sauce and the pepperoni  both tasted rancid.    I was only able to eat the pineapple and the crust which I usually discard.   We didn't order the pizza well done, but the pizza was burnt,  but the crust was all I could eat just because there was no sauce on it and I had to eat something so I could take my meds.. \n\nI have had frozen pizzas that tasted better.   I also couldn't eat the pepperoni because it tasted stale.   \n\nI won't be getting pizza from this Domino's again.   Yuck!   Bad bad job Dominoes.   We are very disappointed!\n\n\n\n\n\nI placed an order for my group (13 large pizzas) over the phone and had a great experience - they even threw in some cinna sticks for free....awesome!  The scheduled delivery time was 6:30, and when no one arrived, I called shortly after and was told the driver left and was on the way and would be there shortly.  It's worth saying that it was being delivered to McClintock and Apache, a mile from the store and straight down Apache Blvd.  When 15 more minutes passed, I called again and said the driver had trouble finding the place and would be there soon.  When all was said and done it was over 20 minutes late.  I had also asked for plates and napkins, but they were out of napkins (no big deal) but would bring plates, which didn't end up making it with the order either.  Pizza is what you would expect from Domino's - average at best.\n\n\n\n\n\nI should ask for a refund. I made an oline order at 8:00, the online tracker said it was out for delivery at 8:38 cool my food is going to be here soon since I live close by. It was 9:26 and I called the store asking where my pizza was since it's been over an hour. The girl over the phone told me the delivery person was close by.  The delivery girl called me asking where my apartment was, I went outside met her and I shouldnt have tipped her because she was late, bitchy, and my food was cold and nasty. Seriously I've never had bad delivery in my life! This was the first time a pizza company fucked up so bad. Get your shit together dominos!\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the doubts you may have about Domino's, this on-campus location is the best bang for your buck. Mon-Thur they have a large three-topping deal for $8.64 (including tax). If that's not a good deal I don't know what is. Domino's also accepts M&G from ASU students. A great late night snack option.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered a pizza from the dominos on Apache Blvd in Tempe, AZ yesterday, got it home, and there was NO CHEESE on it. I thought there was some until I looked at it and realized that was the CRUST I could see between the drizzles of sauce, not cheese. I'll never order from there again. Who does that? \nDominos on Apache Blvd in Tempe, AZ, apparently.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was great, we ordered on the phone & had trouble finding our M&G but they didn't get upset on the wait . Overall , the wings came here in 15 minutes with no time to spare & tasted delicious . Recommend this place for ASU students who get hungry at night & want something quick to come there way (-:\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst service, I ordered a delivery and after waiting an hour and fifteen minutes I decided to give them a call. The manager answered and told me that they weren't doing deliveries anymore. I was never informed by anyone what was going on. When I asked to void the payment he didn't even ask what order mine was and just hung up. I had to call back and make sure he didn't accidentally void anyone else's order. Now I'm a hungry howies fan.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice and easy to order food from the dominos app, however it takes a long ass time for the food to be delivered. Wouldn't recommend wings with the bone in because the skin is not crispy and literally makes you feel like you're eating chicken flesh. Overall, it's a decent experience but we only ever order dominos late at night when nothing else is open.\n\n\n\n\n\nPainting a room and decided to order some pizza tonight to save time. Ordered online at 5:38pm. Website said driver left with our pizza at 5:51. At 6:20 when the pizza hadn't arrived, called the store. I was told to call back in 15 min if it hadn't arrived and they'd \"take care of it\" for me. Called 20 mn later and we were told they were backed up. We asked for new pizzas and they said we'd have to come in and get them in 20 minutes.  The driver came 10 minutes later with pizzas. We told him we called the store to complain about the long time and he said the computers screwed up and didn't give the correct times. He said he had left the store a few minutes ago and the pizzas were \"relatively warm.\"  We asked what took so long and he said he had 3 pizzas to deliver in our neighborhood.  Then he said he left 30 minutes ago.  We explained we planned to pick up hot ones in the store.  He gave a big sigh of disappointment, shook his head and walked away.  Got to the store and it was utter madness.  They credited us our $2 delivery fee and handed us 2 cold and burned pizzas (pictures posted).  Can't say we'll order Domino's pizza again.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsulotly in love with it.. However, they take too long to deliver, but they have good service :)\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried to order a pizza and the cashier had no idea what she was doing, management shouldn't train people when there's a line out of the door, they said it would be an hour, an hour goes by and there's a line out the door for people picking up all because they hired an idiot to work the register, fire her and get one of many people who know how to work a computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nI called in a delivery over an hour and a half ago and didn't receive it. I called and asked to talk to the manager, after 7 mins of being on hold the manager didn't care and didn't offer to fix the situation at all. Adam then told me I could either cancer the order or wAit another 35 mins for a delivery. Terrible customer service\n\n\n\n\n\nSome decent changes seem to be happening here - at least last night. Ordered the two-topping medium pan pizza special for $7.99 which turned out decent. Always a big fan of cheese sticks, so i decided to add the $5.99 stuffed sticks and these were clearly the highlight of the meal. You cut them yourself, but it ends up about six or seven slices of very cheesy bread. These are definetly guilty pleasures. Only negatives is that it will cost 75 cents for any dipping sauce for the bread (blue, marinara, etc) and they don't provide parmesan cheese packets. Everything was done online and arrived hot after about 25 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the place! I come here with my friends for a late night pizza or I order online if I usually want it delivered. They're used to college kids because it's on the campus but the workers are nice and friendly every time. I recommend dominos pizza or the pasta bread bowls. They're bomb!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if the delivery guy grabbed the pizza from under his seat by mistake, but my pizza was old, dry, crunchy, falling apart, assemble-yourself catastrophe.  Needless to say a complaint to corporate is on its way, as Dominos needs to make this right.  Disrespectful to order a pizza and receive this.\n\n\n\n\n\nmanagement is non-existant.  had to wait over an hour and a half for my order.  utterly poor representation of dominos.  avoid at all costs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other night I ordered pizzas on my dominos app one redeeming my free pizza i earned for ordering through dominos so much. My order took over half an hour in quality check and then was canceled. I got a text from chase asking if it was fraud which I understood was a mistake and I cleared the alert. They never called me to tell me why they canceled or even asked for another form of payment which ibwouldve gladly done with cash at the door but either way I tried to call and I was on hold for over an hour and my friend tried calling also and he was too. I tried to order through the app again since we were hungry which was only one pizza this time (because my free pizza redeemable points went away with the last order) and they did the SAME THING and inexplicitly canceled again. Now I have to call dominos to figure out how to get my points back and the whole process was a disappointment and a pain\n\n\n\n\n\nI will not be ordering from this Dominos again. Last week I ordered from here and the pizza took an hour and when we received it it was lukewarm at best. Tonight when I ordered from here they told me they couldn't take my credit card because their machines were down. Strike three and they are out.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery nice workers but TERRIBLE pizza, got a \"deal\" last night spending $25 on 2 x-large pizzas, our Philly cheese steak had NO meat or mushroom and the Buffalo cheese pizza had maybe 10 small pieces of meat. EXTREMELY disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered pizza tonight at 8:41 with an expected 60-70 minute delivery time. It is now 11:00, and I have been on the phone on hold trying to cancel my order for the past half hour and have not been able to reach anyone as of yet. Not the first time this has happened. I was forced to order from a more reliable pizza place nearby unfortunately. I'll bet they still beat your delivery driver here. I'll be tipping your driver as it's not his fault, but will not be paying for the pizza once it finally gets here.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdering online is 100% the best option. The pizza tastes like typical pizza, so there's nothing to complain about there.\n\nThe worst thing about this particular Domino's is the inconsistency in updating the online tracker, and also the communication for how long the pizza will take to be ready. They are also extremely understaffed, so the wait can be up to an hour and a half, even when ordering online.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 0 stars were possible that's what I'd give them. Horrible service. They refused to deliver to my door after I'd ordered delivery from them several times before. I gave up and canceled the order. Last time I ordered from them, the delivery said it was out for over 30 minutes (I live 2 blocks away) and it was cold when I got it.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical drunk kids. \n\nI went here on my lunch break to pick up food for my office around 3 am and it was full of drunk college students falling over and just being obnoxious. The guy behind the counter was picking a giant chunk of food out of his teeth the whole time. Super appealing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWasted an hour of my time because they never made my pizza, even though I checked on my order twice. They didn't even offer to discount my pizza. Canceled my order and went to Osaka grill next door (5/5). Thanks for nothing domino's.\n\n\n\n\n\nFast pizza and great prices but pizza not so good. Won't be coming back because staff is rude. But good if your on a budget\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: I know it's really late but only fair I let everyone know after leaving feedback on their website I was contacted by the store manager and offered two x large pizzas on the house to make up for this. They were made much better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI order from Dominos almost exclusively on account of how great their app is. In every other experience I've had the food has always been good and consistent from every location I've ordered from, from Ohio to Arizona. However, this particular location has let me down regularly. 8 out of 10 times I order from here they get \"lost\" on the way to my apartment, which is only about 2 blocks away. If the delivery time is projected to be 30 minutes, expect to wait about an hour and 10. I've made a habit out of turning my oven on about 30 minutes after I order, because by the time it gets here its usually luke warm and soggy. I don't love Dominos pizza over any other pizza, but I've been loyal to them for years due to the great service, low prices, and convenience. If you are in delivery range of this location and are considering ordering in then I suggest ordering elsewhere. I am now choosing to walk to Pizza Hut rather than get my rewards from the app, getting a free pizza isn't worth it anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered plain stuffed cheesy sticks with 3 marinara sauces (because I had to meet the minimum delivery they enforce), it got here pretty quickly and I opened it up to find they were the jalapeo bacon version with no marinara. Called the store and the guy said \"oh...well...do you want us to remake it?\" To which I said \"yeah, I can't eat it I'm vegetarian and also it's not what I ordered and there's no sauce with it.\" They said okay, offered a free drink, all good they were bringing the right order. Just got delivered and they are now plain stuffed cheese sticks which is right but there is only 1 marinara. Their minimum delivery amount made me spend more money on these stupid marinara packages and then the second time they deliver to me to fix their mistake of a completely wrong order there still aren't as many as they made me buy! Come on guys.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the time finally came for the manager to pick up the phone, he told me that they were understaffed, with too few drivers for the demand tonight. I understand this situation, being a former food service employee. If you are the manager and are reading this: please reach out to your customers if you think their order is not going to leave the store. Some of us have transportation and can pick up our food. But I'm not going to pick up a pizza that sat in a warming oven for 2 hours. That extra star is for the cooks and drivers. I would've given a favorable review had the manager of a business done what a manager should do. \n\nSo yeah, I share an experience very similar to other reviewers. Placed an order at 9:05PM on a Saturday on their website for 1 medium, 1 large, and 1 order of cheese bread. Very excited for the cheese bread. They estimated 97 min to 107 min, which I can accept for a Saturday night. However, it's been not 107 min, but 160 min. I called when the clock hit that first number, and stayed on hold for 47 minutes. Yes, 47 minutes on hold listing to an ad for pizza that I really didn't feel confident I would ever receive. (Of course, I'm not some crazy person who would sit on hold for 47 minutes for pizza and not get some work done online, like write this review). \n\nYou can't waste people's time like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst dominos I've ever visited. Waited 3 hours the first time for my pizza to be delivered, so I called and asked them to cancel the order. Next time, I waited 2 hours and sat on the phone for 20 minutes waiting for them to answer and cancel the order.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous. Such poor customer service. The girl I spoke to had a big attitude too.\nLast time ordering dominos in Tempe!\n\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE the Pan Pizza and how cheap it is only $7.99 plus tax not bad considering I can have two meals out of this. :) When I picked it up the pizza was HOT and was done in less than 15 mins so I have to give this place a 4 star for their service.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took 1 h45min to get my order. Nothing special just a pizza, some wings, and a brownie. They couldn't give me an accurate estimate on delivery EVEN AFTER AN HOUR!!!!! All they could do is say its on its way. Total bullshit. They also forgot the ranch dressing that they charged me for! Food arrived lukewarm at best. Will never order dominos again. I always have issues with their services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Domino's location is very convenient because it's located on Vista Del Sol and they also accept m&g. Every time that I have used their app to order right now or order in the future I have always gotten my pizza on time and with the correct ingredients. The wait time does get long when there are large groups of students ordering for big club events and such but the wait time is typically very short. The pizza is good for a snack at night if you're at ASU but apart from that it's just a normal Domino's.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered through the app on my iPhone. That was awesome, and easy to use. Ordered their pasta bowl! It was ready in the time that was stated. Staff is friendly enough! I love the pasta bowl, they are awesome! Not complaints and I like this location.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Domino's location is awesome! Everytime I get a pizza here it is warm, delicious and the crust is nice and fluffy. Other locations in the area have been disappointing. \n\nNo experience with the employees or service. The pizza is great though!\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate and stores can't figure out what they're doing communication wise.... Person in store told me to disregard anything the pizza tracker says and said I should cancel my order if I didn't want a pizza that had been prepared over 30 minutes ago according to their tracker.\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING!!! This place is ridiculously understaffed.. Order took an hour to get ready, sitting there waiting for delivery for like 40 mins... no drivers to deliver is what they said when I called. Do not order from here unless ready to wait like 2 hours. \nManager if you reading this.. gotta do something buddy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a joke. I ordered at 530p didn't get my order till 630p on top of the hour the order was wrong. when we called to complain, was put on hold 3 separate time in the same phone call. after hanging up and calling back we were told a new pizza was on the way. 800p rolls around no pizza. took another phone call and 30 mins to get the right pizza. I work hard for my money, I know they do to, but when im spending 20bucks of my hard earned cash I want what I ordered. WTF!!\n\n\n\n\n\nJust the worst dominos in the world . Also , Lyndsi was the worst server of my life . I am just writing this here so she can change her shitty behavior\n\n\n\n\n\nThey made me wait 50 minutes for 1 large pizza. When I opened the box, the cheese wasn't melted properly, the marinara sauce was overflowing, and there was barely even any toppings on it. Very unsatisfied with this dominos. I tend to eat quite a bit of dominos but this was by far my worst experience with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy pizza was very burned. Not edible. See attached photos. The manager promised me I would get a refund, but I never got one.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely the worst experience I've ever had ordering a pizza. Manager literally hung up on me after telling me to F**k off. Who let's these people run a business. I'd be afraid of what they do to people's orders. White trash mesa people running this store. Had to dispute my credit card order.Do not order pizza from this location.\n\n\n\n\n\nDriver had a really bad attitude. The apartment number was wrong and she asked \"Sooo did you just enter it wrong or what?\" Then she kept me on the phone without talking while she trudged over to my apartment. I apologized for the mix up and she said nothing. The most interaction she had with me at the door, was to ask if this was my credit card?  I still tipped her because I've been a server before, but thinking back maybe I should not have. I would never have been so rude to a customer. The pizza tasted pretty good, but I already had a bad taste in my mouth. Next time I will order from Papa John's or one of the 10 other pizza places near ASU.\n\n\n\n\n\nI used the app to order a pizza. I specifically remember ordering two pizzas and picking the toppings for both pizzas and then added on a marble cookie. Instead I got one of the pizzas and two marble cookies. I understand this is not the stores fault it is the app. \nThe way the manager handled the situation was completely the fault of the store. I called to explain what happened but instead the manager decided to interrupt me and tell me I got what I ordered and there was nothing he could do. I tried to explain that the second pizza was pretty specific and it was hard to forget building that pizza on the app. However he interrupted me again to tell me that I was interrupting him. How ironic. The entire time I was talking very calmly yet he still decided to hang up on me. \n\nI called back because I found that the hang up was completely uncalled for. He continued to yell at me as I spoke to him calmly. He then told me he was flagging my account and I would never receive pizzas from there again. Then he told me if I called back that he would call 911 for harassment. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm not surprised that most of the yelp reviews are 1 or 2 stars. This was the worst costumer service ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst impressions really mean a lot to me. I called here to order my pizza tonight and the first person I spoke to didn't even say hello. She answered the phone and told me she was going to put me on hold and by the time I said \"thank you\" she had already hit the button. Great customer service lady. After waiting a few minutes a very friendly gentleman took my order. I was happy to not be speaking to the short, rude lady and he made up for a little of it but I was still rubbed the wrong way from the beginning. \n\nI gotta say though, I love that this location takes M&G dollars so I don't have to use cash or a credit card. And their service is always very quick and everything is hot and fresh. But I do think they need to work on their skills when answering the phone so they don't rub their customers the wrong way off the get go. Luckily, I love pizza so they will be continuing to get business for me but I hope next time they are a bit more pleasant!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy issue was I placed an online order, when the delivery guy came to drop off my pizza I realized it was wrong and called Dominos as soon as I opened the box. The girl was prompt to tell me that they will switch it out with my right pizza and will bring lava cakes to apologize for the inconvenience. That the person who is delivering it would be about 25-35 mins. Okay, so not bad for a messed up order the attempted to fix it. Well now almost an hour from when I called, I call back to see if everything was okay and if the person may have gotten lost with my order. I was rudely told that they sent someone out and it should be coming soon. I asked if there why was there a hold up with my order and she persisted to say that they have my phone number that it should be fine and rudely hung up. I've never had an issue with dominos until now and will consider not ordering again.\n\n\n\n\n\nYo, this shit was amazing. Domino's is my shit, and the fact that they deliver so late is even better when you drunk as heeeeelllll.\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding outside waiting for dominoes theyre 10 minutes late to my class is on break and they're all hungry for pizza this is no fun at all call three times to make sure that it was going to be here on time but Apparently they don't care\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time ordering from this location and I'm sitting here about an hour out wondering if my pizza will ever arrive...

If you want to drink, then I suppose this place is ok, but if you want food, then this ain't the place.  \n\nVery basic and very average bar food.  It reminded me of the food I'd expect at a small airport in the 80s. \n\nThe workers were nice, but not necessarily helpful.  We walked in and spoke with a gentleman greeting people at a host table on the patio. I asked for a table for hour. He directed me towards a door on the far right.  After going in there, there was no real direction. I found a host stand, but after waiting five minutes discovered there wasn't a host!  Tracked down a bartender who said to find a table outside and order from the bar and it will be delivered.  Went back outside looking for a table and there weren't any available.  Went back inside and found a table where people were leaving and took it... the waitress was nice and helpful, but she was swamped.  Tried to find someone to refill out shot-glass size water and soda. No luck. Blah,blah, blah you know the story. \n\nAnyway, if you want to drink and get drunk so much that you need to stumble to the stadium, then this is your place.  If not, try any place else.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow average for sure. Got there around 5pm on a game night on Friday and was seated within 10 minutes. That was the best part. Service a bit slow. 5-10 minutes to get our beers and the one person who ordered a non-alcoholic drink took even longer! We ordered the chicken nachos...not good. Plain tasting, just not good. Server was friendly but not very attentive. The outside area looked fun with cornhole and games. Would not recommend overall. Would come here before a beer before the game and that's it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe waited over an hour only to be told we had to sit at high top because they can't seat parties of two at low tables. Due to back issues cannot do high chairs. Alternative offered was to sit on crowded patio by asking strangers to move over and then go stand in yet another line because no table service on patio. Will never go back and will be sure to tell anyone I know to never ever go thetr\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is basically a concession stand . \n\nWe came in yesterday before the game . We went to the smaller bar and waited over 10 mins to get the bartender to serve us . So we walked over the the larger bar instead in hopes to get a drink . We did,  but my husband did not get Grand Marnier.. It was a clear liquor. We told  him it was not correct and he was puzzled ( grand Marnier is a orange color ) He went and got a new bottle from the back . \n\nThe bottle looked old . They clearly refill this bottle . It's not the bartenders fault , but as a bartender you should know what color your liquors are lol ! And owners /management should stay in the same color scheme when being shady !! \n\nThe bartender called over his manager . The manager dumped out the clear liquor but didn't throw away the bottle . So again , this just means they plan to do this again and again . Sad .\n\nA quick drink before heading to the game seems like a great idea , but we not be returning . I wanna know my drinks are real and we are not getting ripped off .\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat location before a Dbacks game! But not worth the money! \nPoor service. Food was just average. Paper plates and plastic cups for beer! Really? Won't go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here for a few drinks before a diamondbacks matinee. The drinks are reasonably priced for the most part and the staff was very friendly. We did not order any food though so I can not review that aspect of this restaurant .\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat location right outside of the stadium, but the smell inside will drive you away. It's August in the desert, and I don't want to sit outside. However, the odor inside the bar might be enough to convince me to endure the heat. I certainly would not want to eat with that smell. Maybe I'll be back when I can enjoy sitting outside.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I thought would be a good spot since it's immediately next to Chase Field, turned out to be a bad idea. Smelled awful when I came in, almost like raw sewage. And the place was pretty much empty following a game which was a surprise. The patio was empty too. Wouldn't come back again for free beers!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst service!  Waitress was horrible kept disappearing. So disappointed!  Get new wait staff! Who know what to do when restaurant is busy!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nSituated right smack in front of the ballpark, this is an easy meeting spot for pregame drinks.  It's only open for home games, so they definitely have their niche.  We only stopped in for drinks before and after the game and didn't eat. Although we did see massive plates of nachos being served next to us and they looked fantastic.  The bar staff was a little on the slow side.  Would I make an effort to go here when any other time? No, but for a pre/post game drink it is just fine\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't make the mistake of being drawn in by the close proximity or outside scenery to Chase Field if you're looking for good service or food like we did. Our food (2 pulled pork sandwiches and 1 brisket sandwich) took 45 minutes to arrive at our table after ordering. Besides the food being mediocre, the waitress wasn't very attentive to our needs and told us she didn't even want to live in Pheonix anymore, which probably attributed to her lack of caring. There was a short wait because it was an hour and a half before the game started which we understood. After the hostesses finally put their cell phones down and decided to help seat us, they informed us of an upstairs bar and seating that had no wait. It wasn't until we got up there that they told us it was a limited menu (which was fine.. we had a beer while we waited for another table downstairs).. But why bother having all that space if you aren't going to serve a full menu?? The bartenders shared their displeasure, as I probably would too, because of the potential sales/money they were losing out on by serving a VERY small portion of the menu. We felt bad for them because they were very nice and attentive and deserved better. I didn't mention that we had a member of our party who is disabled on crutches before they led us on the journey upstairs. I would never eat here again but it might be a decent pre-game drinking environment on the patio before the game. Maybe next visit.. until then, I'll stick to Padres games in SoCal! This place should take some notes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has horrible food. I am sorry. It really isn't that good. Nothing we sampled was worth writing about, the pulled pork was dry, the loaded potato skins were wet (oily) and the pretzel cheese was tasty but so runny it wouldn't stay on the pretzels - which weren't that good themselves.\n\nThe three stars are for the following:\n\nLive Music - the Stage is perfect, and the location is so fun, and the band they had (The Hamptons Band) was excellent.  It was so fun outside and everyone was dancing and clapping and drinking (and trying to smoke...but getting busted! LOL! No smoking on the patio on either side!)\n\nStephanies - Both of them are amazing and they both worked really hard to help us all day.  They are a great team.  The service and management there is really quite good. They were running out of everything in sight (ketchup, soda, ice, etc.) and they worked hard to please.  I was there for a while, so I saw how hard they worked!\n\nThe Apple Pie Dessert Thing - Too good...so good! Like a big chewy turnover with apples and chewy yummy crust! Vanilla bean ice cream with caramel drizzled over it. YUMMMY\n\nIt's hard to avoid this place if you like baseball, so go after the game for a drink and yummy apple stuff.  And, hopefully there will be fun music! :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nHottest seemed lost and unsure of what to do.  They weren't even busy and our food took forever.  Server was rude as well but my food was good and the beer was cold.  I'm sure it's a good place after a game if you are drinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here during Dbacks Fan Fest not just for the DBacks Alumni Players signing that was happening on the restaurant's corridor, but also to visit friends who were there and grab a bite to eat during a break int he action of Fan Fest. Well, come to find out they closed the kitchen so I wasn't able to get anything to eat. I was majorly disappointed...that's a BIG fail in my book! \n\nLooking over their menu ahead of time, about the only reasonably priced item I saw was their salad, I believe a grilled chicken one if I recall...the rest of the items were rather pricey, and from seeing what friends of mine have ordered in the past, they definitely give you your money's worth and then some, but yeah, I wouldn't make this place an everyday stop for food.\n\nI would like to be able to TRY it sometime,, however, so I can give it a \"second chance\" and see if my star ratings will go up or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere is great for pre-game beers. I would have given higher marks but I'm not impressed with the food. Friends ordered nachos. They're not bad but they use Cheese Whiz. Some people like that processed crap but I don't. Soooo, beware. I ordered the \"brisket\" quesadilla. I put it in \" \" because there wasn't much meat. I couldn't tell if I was eating bacon bits or \"brisket\". The quesadilla was very gooey, and not in a good way. The tortilla was soft and soggy. I wish the cook had left it on the burner longer. I'm not sure what the sauce mix is, it cones on the side. The server didn't know either. I suggest asking for their BBQ sauce. They offer 3 different kinds. \n\nOverall, cheaper beers then inside the stadium. Good pre-game atmosphere. Food is just ok.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in at the start of the game. I ended up having to work and had to pull out my laptop and I wasn't ready to make my way into the park. My server was outstanding and got helped with my every request. At the time I visited, the menu was limited, and there weren't too many options. I selected the nachos fries, which were fine but I would have preferred a meal. I can see how this is a great place to hang out pre- and post-game but it's pretty slow once the game starts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went in for dinner before a Diamondbacks game. I expect it to be busy but 45 minutes for one cheeseburger, which wasn't even our correct order is a little much. The coleslaw was not edible, oh and they forgot to bring it to us with the order. When we complained, we were told they are busy and only got 20% off. I will walk (with my currently broken leg) somewhere else to never go here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI miss Sliders.  You walk in here and \"the right side of the restaurant is open seating, but you can't order from the menu\"  the left side of the restaurant is for seating and eating??  Annoying. \n\nThis is not the same \"Pre-game\" spot it used to be.  $16.00 for a hamburger?  Served in a metal \"tub\"?  \n\nI opted for the Brisket Sandwich and the brisket was beyond over cooked and DRY!  I mean it was chewy and tough.  The fries were soggy and not good at all.  \n\nMy friend ordered the pulled pork potato skins and they were the size of a teeny tiny potato...one that had probably been grown in Smurf village...I mean they were tiny.  \n\nFor a pre-game spot that is literally a stone's throw from the ballpark...this place is ridiculously overpriced and not at all the fun hang out it used to be.  \n\nYes, when I say over priced for where it is and what it is for....I mean over priced.  The quality of food has gone down.  Not to mention, my beer was not very cold at all!  \n\nI would have given it two stars, but the service was very friendly and very helpful.  \n\nNeed to find a new place to hang out before the game!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a pregame cocktail find another place. I was at Game Seven Grill 45 minutes before first pitch and almost took that long to get a beer. Only 2 very long lines available to order a drink. Apparently management was not aware a baseball game would be happening?\n\n\n\n\n\nI love a well placed, fun sports bar to go to before the game that day. When its well run, there is nothing better. When its poorly managed, it has \"Meh\" written all over it. Lets turn double play and discuss Game Seven:\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nI must admit, I did not try food when I went. Reason being, it was pretty expensive, and I had already stretched the ol' budget for the tickets I got. I saw some people's items, and yes it does beat what you get in the stadium, but just by a little. Quality is that of a normal sports bar. I have seen much better. As for drinks, wow, so priced up. I get it, I do. They have to to make ends meet. But seriously, $6.50 for a pint? Plus, its just general across the board, so from Stella to Budweiser....its $6.50. It once again beats inside, but why bother? There is a place right down the corner that is about half this price.....hmm I wonder where...read on...\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nJust like the old Sliders here, nothing much has changed. Its a nice wide open space with two levels to choose from. The outdoor patio is inviting, even in hot weather there are misters and a good amount of room to bring a group of friends. There is not much ambiance to the place, the bar area itself is wide open with a couple TV's and long bar. Not an abundance of flare or items on walls. As for service, I can only attest to the barkeeps. They were very attentive, although I went very early to the game and was one of the few there...it wasn't hard to serve me. Each of the individuals I worked with were talkative and fun, and were prompt when I asked to close out.\n\n\nExtras/Rating~\nTwo stars are provided for location to ballpark and friendly service. I truly feel that this is place is a trap for out-of-towners. They  come to see their team and did not check it out in advance or ask the motel/hotel where to go pre-game. I went for the Orioles series, and at the first game, there was a sea of orange here. The next game, they all realized to go to another location...I did as well. For better deals, including HAPPY HOUR PRICES, go to Coach's Corner, just a stone's throw away on Jefferson. Prices for food and drinks are much cheaper, along with comparable service. I rarely shout out another business on a review, but seriously, do not waste your money for beer, it makes no sense. I see redeeming factors if you have a super large group of friends wanting a quick beer or two before/after the game. Besides that, skip Game Seven Grill and choose from a ton of other bars in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Seven Grill is a great place to hang out and grab a drink after visiting Chase Field! \n\nI ended up at Game Seven Grill after an event at neighboring Chase Field and walked into a Casino themed private party. The bar itself is quite large and Game Seven also offers a gigantic outdoor deck that had a live DJ when I visited. The beer options seem to be the same as what Chase Field offered and the prices seemed to be similar as well so you will shell out a bit to get your drink on ($8.00), but considering its locale that is to be expected. \n\nGame Seven Grill gets 3 Stars worth of funk.\n\n\n\n\n\nConvenient place to grab a drink after a Diamondbacks game, which is why we ended up there. The service was painfully slow & they were constantly hurrying us to close out.\n\n\n\n\n\nConvenient if you are going to the D'backs game as it's right outside the entrance gates.\n\nThe menu is fairly limited and is pretty BBQ-centric. Not the greatest burger I have ever had, but not the worst either.\n\nFull bar and several taps including some local craft brews.\n\nWorks for when you've misjudged your travel time, don't have time to explore the surrounding downtown area (which surely has better offerings) and want to avoid paying ballpark prices for food inside the stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nI noticed that there were a few positive reviews towards the end.They must be paid shills. This place is now so different than before with the rules of \"you can't sit here and just order drinks outside in the hot sun unless you have a food order\"\nAnd then they have all these military style thugs breathing down your neck all the time. They must have a lot of people leave without paying.I never ordered from this despicable crappy place because I hate the atmosphere. Very few people go in there anymore because it is so Nazi.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeated quickly before the game, is the only reason I am giving this place one star.  I ordered the veggie flatbread and my boyfriend ordered the bratwurst and fries. They brought out the bratwurst and a salad so we thought it was the wrong table but the waitress came and tried to ask why we rejected it, then said oh they got the order wrong so your flatbread will be a few mins. They brought out the CHICKEN flatbread, so I just accepted so I wouldn't have to wait longer. Good thing I am not a vegetarian or a picky eater. Bratwurst and fries were horrible. Fries were not cooked. We decided to order some drinks before we left so I asked the waitress what their well vodka was, she replied Tito's. I was shocked and said really? She said yes. Ok cool ya we will take that. Then came back and said sorry our well is svedka so I just put that in for you. Nevermind maybe I wanted a better vodka. Then we received the check folder and it had a nasty blob of jizz in it. Never received any apology of any kind. The wait staff seems oblivious. The patio is cool though. To drink.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery slow and the food was ok. Kind of overpriced for what they had. The menu was also very limited. Don't come with kids.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came in after the Padres game a few weeks ago because my buddy wanted to do the wing contest......epic fail!!! Those wings are soooo hott!!! We split a regular order of wings, pulled pork sliders and a burger, the food was great!! Service was excellenct and the beers were ice cold!! This is one of the better sports bars in the downtown area and i would give them 5 stars if they were open ALL THE TIME, and not just gameday!\n\n\n\n\n\nHottest seemed lost and unsure of what to do.  They weren't even busy and our food took forever.  Server was rude as well but my food was good and the beer was cold.  I'm sure it's a good place after a game if you are drinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered my food an hour before the game. Got it 5 minutes before the game. Couldn't find my waitress to cancel my order or pay my tab. Terrible.\n\n\n\n\n\nthis place was HORRIBLE... we got a burger and they ASKED if we wanted ketchup..it arrived 5 minutes later..as we were leaving a couple was having the same issue...if u are going to offer burgers on the menu, ketchup should be automatic..we won't be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what people aren't understanding about game 7 Grill, it's operated by the concession people who manage inside the ballpark, Levy restaurants. They're not in the business of having an actual Sports Bar. every year they get a new manager because the previous manager got frustrated and either transfers out or quits. the big shots at Levy keep saying we're going to change things this year, and then they don't. every year during their first week of baseball, the other restaurants in the area come in and steal/recruit the best workers so what you're left with are the leftover people who got hired last because they're not working concessions inside the ballpark. Instead of leaving bad reviews on Yelp, why not contact Levy restaurants directly and share your thoughts so that they take this beautiful building seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas excited to try the new menu at \"Game 7\".  4 of us got there at 11:15 for a 1:05 game on a Sunday.....  Restaurant was definately NOT full.  A hostess sat us and did not leave menu's. The manager/general manager (short haired guy running around with NO customer service skills) almost threw us out because we were sitting without menus in front of us and thought we \"snuck\" in.  I pointed to the front hostess stand and explained he should be talking to the hostess instead of making my group feel like criminals for sitting there. We were hungry otherwise that would of been the end of that.\n     The  tables that were available were outside... We started with a table in the shade, but after a 1:45 minute meal we were in DIRECT sunlight. by the end....Umbrellas would have been a nice touch...especially in AZ. \n    The people at the BENCH next to us had an issue with the red bench paint transferring to their clothes.  This same manager explained that he does not MAKE the benches, he runs a restaurant.  Our table, their table and other tables in earshot could not believe the explanation he was giving them. To his credit he discounted their bill, but definitely made an uncomfortable situation worse.......AGAIN\n   All business' have problems.  It is how a business HANDLES the problems.  This manager , face of the business, better have his days numbered as the food was not bad. \n    There will always be one extra table available IF you go to this place as I will not be back...Thank the management for that......\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible service. Will have to go to a better bar before attending any games.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot worth it. \nGranted it's close to Chase Field but if you want hot food served in a fast and friendly manner do not go here.\n\n\n\n\n\nI do not recommend this place at all!!! Not only did they get my order wrong, it took longer to get our check than it did to get our food!!!! The service here sucks!!!!  It may be busy because of the game, but thats no reason for bad service!!! If the music is too loud to here your customers, then turn it down!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nPoorly staffed. Either need to get better quality servers/bartenders and/or just more staff working. Servers were running around like crazy, driving people to the bar to close out or get drinks. Similarly, bartenders could not multitask. It was awkward to watch as the two bartenders looked lost working at snail speed or they would form into pods with whom looked like mgmt for minutes at a time. It took me 10 mins to get a beer. The group of three next to me wanted to cash out to get into the game. That started to build up tension as staff ignored them. Lost out on sales. Multiple groups stopped by next to me to grab a quick drink, all of who just left, went into the game because they didn't want to wait any longer. To add, the bartender didn't know where basic bottles were or if you had them. Lost money! And finally, you are a place right next to a pro baseball stadium and you don't have the MLB package or at least sporting events on all the tv's? I asked about a certain game which I received a swift \"no\", and left with nothing. Not an offer to change the channel. There was an R rated movie on with explicit subtitles playing on multiple tv's. I couldn't believe it at first. What the heck are you guys doing? I'm guessing because you are next to the stadium, you believe you will make sales regardless of quality of staff and product. Disappointing business portfolio. I won't ever be spending my money here again. The bud light tasted like bud light. That's a positive.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered the pretzel basket as an appetizer prior to watching the D-back at Chase Field. For $8, we got four little pretzel bites. We would have been better off buying a full pretzel at Chase field as it was cheaper there!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here for the Diamondbacks Home Opener. It was packed, which we expected and they did a wonderful job 5 stars getting us a table for four. We sat inside and did not have the option to sit on their huge outdoor patio.We ordered and were served cocktails immediately. Surprisingly, after 5 minutes the waiter took our food order - we expected much longer because it was packed. My husband ordered the G7 Burger and I ordered the Moonshine salad - our friends both ordered the wings. After 35 minutes we finally were served. My husbands burger was suppose to have pepperjack cheese but did not have any cheese. No condiments were offered and his fries were rubbery and cold. So he ate a burger without cheese or condiments. He didn't eat more than 3 or 4 fries. My salad was huge and fresh but the chicken and bacon were missing. It was good for a 'Garden Salad' but that was not what I ordered. Our friends loved the chicken wings but the lack of napkins disappointed them. Drinks were only refilled once. I think on our next visit to a Diamondbacks game we'll take the advice of other patrons and visit a restuarant many blocks away from the stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuite good, and across from the ballpark so easy access to the game after dining or getting a quick bite or drink before the game.  Portions are large and quite tasty and the noise level is high.  Only disappointment was reserving a seat meant next to the bar.  My husband dislikes the \"tall chairs\" we asked for a lower table but was told that's what we reserved; not what I had in mind when I made the reservation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't usually go to the bars around the ballpark.  I have never been impressed with the food or prices. \n\nBut we found ourselves at the ballpark early last weekend. And decided to go in at least to get out of the heat. \n\nI found they have a nice selection of beers on tap including a favorite Cider that I enjoy.  They also had a nice selection of appetizers.  Theme of the menu revolved around pulled pork items along with the normal burgers and sandwiches. \n\nWe had the potato skins with pulled pork and a couple of drinks.  Was very pleased as it started the day off. \n\nWill consider this location again for full meal alternatives before game time!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood beer. Met up for beers before the game. Little bit of a wait but not terrible. I would go back again. We got a beer bucket and we could mix them to meet our different tastes. We did not eat here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service at this place is terrible. We couldn't get any bartenders' attention. & when we asked about our food we were ignored by a server(?). We waited over 50 minutes for nachos, a flatbread, & wings. The flatbread & wings were decent, the only reason for 2 stars. The nachos were cold & soggy. Very disappointed.\nThere's too much great food within walking distance to ever return here.\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty perfect for a pre-game beer, although they could lower the prices for the beers. It was $12 for a Bud Light bottle and a draft beer. Domestic Bottles in a ballpark zone should not be more than four bucks. Anyway, the inside had nice AC going and a long bar, but we were outside in the spacious beer garden area and there was plenty of room and picnic tables to sit at to enjoy a pre-game beverage. The grill is right across from the stadium, so this is the place to drink one before heading inside, but it doesn't feel like a real sports bar as in other cities. They did have a band playing outside, but the whole baseball atmosphere was lacking (maybe a TV outside would help). Then again, Phoenix is not really a baseball town or a good baseball team this year, so that is the likely explanation for the low-key surroundings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe only had beers ($7.50 each for a plastic cup of Four Peaks) but the environment was pleasant right next to the stadium and under misters on the patio. It's too bad the craft beer second floor is only open on the weekends as the patio got pretty packed close to game time.\n\n\n\n\n\n1 bartender the night of a DBacks game. Terrible. \nNot enough tables with so much open space available.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was an overall disappointing dining experience. We wanted to get a quick bite to eat before the game. There was a considerable wait which was okay because we knew it was busy. After waiting 25 minutes we were seated. Our waitress did not acknowledge the table for almost 20 minutes after we were sat. From there it went downhill. Horrible horrible service. Ordered the pulled chicken and it came out looking like pulled pork - lots of low quality dark meat. The waitress says \"this is pork\" and says she will get a new one. Then the chef comes out and says nope it was chicken. They bring out a new sandwich - the same nasty chicken. There are cheap drinks but I would not recommend eating here - we won't be coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. The only positive is the server was kind. Other than that, it's terrible. Sure, some may say \"it's opening day, they were slammed\" unfortunately that is not the case. It's pretty dead upstairs and there is plenty of room downstairs. We waited 10 minutes for someone to come and serve us, we waited 25 minutes for ONE order of nachos and they came out completely cold. On top of that, it took another ten for drinks. \n\nIm giving an extra star from my original one star because the resolution was swift, they were kind and apologetic. \n\nThe hostess was very helpful in the resolution as well\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Seven is a great spot for snacks and a few drinks before a D-Backs game.\n\nWhile it can get quite crowded since it's right outside the Chase D-Backs baseball stadium, I would say it's worth it.\n\nThey have a full bar serving all types of liquors and good beer options on tap. I wouldn't brag about the food but they have descent snacks to munch on before the baseball games. \n\nService is fast even when they have a full-house and the location is solid. My go-to when attending a home game.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere is ok, food is average, service slow. Dont get the pulled pork, all gristle for $12.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here with family after D Back game. Worst customer service ever. Didn't greet you or say hi. Didn't give us a menu or ask if we wanted drinks. Sat ourselves down and waited for someone to come over. There was only but maybe 10 people in here may I add. Finally after waiting 15 minutes did someone come over and asked us if we wanted something to drink. Bartender with Arizona hat on saw us and said nothing either to us. Server finally brought us our drinks and asked us if we were ready to order. Told her we didn't have a menu. She stated that's it right there in front of you with literally just wings and pizza on it. Completely disappointed in this place. The owner should be ashamed of his staff here. How there in business makes me wonder. Would never recommend this place to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery bad service... It takes forever for everything... Getting seated, food orders, food arrival... They say the grilled cheese has bacon but it's no where to be found... If it wasn't so close to the field we won't even be here... Restaurant rescue where are you?\n\n\n\n\n\nWill not return...ordered 2 small side salads...pork sandwich with fries...quesadilla with brisket...received one salad and one hamburger and quesadilla...what the heck...didn't take too long to get rest of food....don't think quesadilla had any brisket...a small scoop of coleslaw was with pork sandwich..what was that all about ...two stars only because the draft beer was cold and sauces on table were good...had to ask for dressing for salad..Doesn't a server..waitress check order slips when they pick up food...too many other places to enjoy before DBacks game...plus we felt prices high for what you get.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe attended a Dbacks game and needed to catch a bite to eat since we were hours early to the field. Game seven was closest so we went in. We were seating promptly since the Restaurant was pretty much empty. Our servers name was Carlos and he seemed friendly enough. Most of their food had really sweet barbecue sauce but it was edible. Within an hour the restaurant pretty much filled up. Our server forgot about us and treated us like an inconvenience for ordering drinks, which he kept forgetting to bring.\n\nWe decided to move outside to the patio so we didn't have to sit at the table any longer. We split the bill and one of us was charged with the whole thing so they got paid twice. We brought this to the servers attention. He reran the card but when our card cleared we were still charged the full amount. That was a week ago.\n\nSince then I have contacted the restaurant multiple times. I finally spoke with the male manager whom informed me that it wasn't his job and I would have to contact accounting.  He didn't take down any of my info he just gave me another number to a lady that wouldn't be in the office for another five days. \n\nSince I have been playing phone tag with her. I am still waiting for someone to take my info and I can't get my money back. DON'T eat here... Unless you like crappy service, crappy management, and crappy accounting!!! This is the service industry! I would expect to be treated with some hospitality!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a horrible experience it was coming here before our game. I wish I could give it less then one star. They do not offer any vegetarian food, everything is loaded down with meat. Not every baseball fan eats meat. The female bartender working at 12:20 pm on Wednesday afternoon was rude. She got the order wrong twice and never stuck around to be helpful enough to receive a tip. Won't ever be back. This place is a joke of overpriced waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible experience on multiple occasions. Don't go here post or prior game. They will serve you and kick you out because they are closing exactly one hour after game.  They will also try to take more cash for their tip going you will not realize. Tried to take $20 tip on a$77 bill. Never again,  rude staff as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here and wished I had read the reviews first because every 1-2 star review is absolutely true.  $65 for two small beers, two mixed drinks, a burger and some nachos.  Food crap and fortunately you cant screw up beer.  Dimetri was our server and he was the best thing about the whole experience.  Sad since everything else decent near the ballpark has closed up.  Alice Cooper- please open Cooperstown again!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery poor service.  Food was just ok.\n\nCame here before a Diamondbacks game to eat because it was close. Hostess stand did a good job managing us. Communicated well and got us seated. \n\nWaitress didn't seem to know our table number. Took our order, stopped by about 10 minutes after she took our order and said she wanted to out it in the system correctly ( we were hoping our food and drinks would come about then).  \n\nFood and drinks came at the same time.  Waitress said she would refill my wife's water, but never did. She buzzed past saying she would get us our bill\n\nHad to flag her down and give her my card because the bill never came. She reviewed what we ordered because she thought the table number was wrong. Sigh. Didn't she do that before?\n\nWe have now waited another 10 minutes for our check. We will miss the start of the game. \n\nI dread seeing the bill. It will likely be wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou probably don't want to be short staffed on Opening Day. Took 30 minutes to order at the bar, then the bartender forgot to give us the drinks. Who knows how long before we get the nachos we ordered. \n\nAlso, can you make the upstairs patio nonsmoking? All the doors were open and the smoke stink was getting inside. So gross.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot impressed.\nSat at the bar to wait for the rest of the gang to show up for the Dodgers vs diamondbacks game.\n2 drinks and a quesadilla appetizer ended up 25 bucks.\nBartender l female was not very welcoming or nice.\nIt was busy so just really trying to churn the crowd it seemed.\nBbq quesadilla was dry but came with salsa. \nProbably better to just sit outside and grab your own beer from the little tent.\n\nGlad we didn't grab a full table and have a meal.\nIt is convenient that it's on property of the stadium bit that's about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible service... cold food ... good thing beers come in cans. Bugs in mixed drinks... bar rescue couldn't save this hell hole.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible service. The waitress had no idea what she is doing. Food is just as bad. There is tons of better place near by. Do yourself a favor. Go somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of watching the Phillies having BP we decided to save a few bucks and get our buzz on at Game Seven Grill located just outside the entrance gates. With ample seating and plenty of flat screens Game Seven is your typical sports bar.\n\nWe decided to share a couple of appetizers to enjoy with our drinks. Definitely nothing to write home about. Very average tasting/processed food that was more filler than anything else. The drinks were good but the service was pretty lackluster considering the customers-to-employee ratio. It was just too difficult to get another round and WAY to difficult to get our bill AND pay our bill. I think if we sat at the bar at least the drink experience would have been better.\n\nI'd come back to Game Seven Grill in the future but it would be primarily for drinks only. The service and food do not justify having a full-on meal there especially with all of the other options available in and around the stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecided to try this place after looking at the menu online and watching the clip about it during a Dbacks game onTV.  Will not go back!\n\nFIrst off, there is little seating unless you have a RESERVATION!  Many available tables to the left of the entrance for reservations, but for folks without a reservation tables were to the right side.  Our choices were inside where there was a bar and about 15 tables (all full) , or outside where there were about 5 tables and some red picnic tables lined up.  \n\nThe picnic tables were so close together some were difficult to get between and were filthy!  Plus, the red seemed to rub off on clothes and shoes.\n\nNow we could deal with all that seeing as the place is right outside the stadium.  So we found a table and tried to order food.  We had to ask around to find how to do that- then be self-sufficient in the process!  We had to go to the hostess station for a menu, and then go inside to the bar to order and pay.  They did ask where we were sitting, brought it out when it was done and waiters appeared once the order was up to bring the food and condiments.  Food was just OK- \n\nThe real kicker for us was that the prices on the menu for food and beer were not what  we were charged.  Our hamburger was listed at 10.95 but we were charged 11.95- not a huge difference but still annoying.\n\nThe real difference came in the beer.  Beers listed on the menu as $5-$6 were actually $7-$8 when you got them!  Again not a big deal seeing as we were so close to the stadium, but still annoying.  Why print a menu price if it's not correct???\n\nIf the tables had been clean, the place more organized, and the menu pricing reflecting the actual prices- the whole experience would have been different for us.  \nThe place is convenient if you are meeting someone before a game, but I can honestly say we will not be returning!\n\n\n\n\n\nThree stars for being directly across the street from Chase Field. Great place to meet people before a baseball game. Besides that, not a whole lot to say. Cold beer, average wings/burgers. Honestly, most people would never go if not for the location. But the location is perfect, so it's usually pretty full on game days. Pro tip: If you are just drinking head to the patio where they usually have beer tubs rather than wait for a server.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place to go before Diamondbacks games, not a lot going on afterwards. Drinks are about the same price as the Diamondbacks game.\n\nBartenders were very friendly and served everyone quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've always wanted to try this place. I'm glad I did but not sure if I'd go back. Had to go fetch my own beer from the bar because the waiter saw a beer can on the table and assumed it wasn't empty. The food was...eh, ok. The Redneck Tacos sounded good but didn't taste as good as it sounded. The slaw was soured and not edible. The wings were average at best. Just disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWaste of bar space. Every TV behind the bar was set to a slideshow of the DBacks logo then their lineup. Definitely needs a big change. Coach's corner is smaller, but a lot better. They show baseball games on their TVs\n\n\n\n\n\nVery sadly disappointed. We were looking for a place to hang out before the game, get some good food and beers and pregame. The beer garden was nice. We went to the beer cart, got our drinks and that was fine. Went inside to order food and I wish I wouldn't have. As I was looking over the menu the bartender was talking about how sad it is that people don't tip. I ordered the below photoed food. A burger and nachos. 30 dollars before the obligatory tip. Food was delivered in baskets with no napkins, forks, or condiments while other tables were brought baskets that had all of the above in them. No service at all in the beer garden. Which is fine, but would have been nice. We won't be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI see why this place only had two stars. Get your beer and get out. Don't waste your time ordering food. Their nachos are disgusting. The cheese feels and tastes like it used to be powder, extremely grainy. And the service is not on point what so ever. Very disappointed to say the least.\n\n\n\n\n\nI go here often because it's a convenient spot to meet up before the game, but after they treated my friends and I so rudely this past weekend I'll never bother again. We grabbed a beer at the bar in the back because it was less crowded and we were standing in a corner and in front of the stairs that were blocked off from public access anyway but we got yelled at (and I literally mean yelled at) to move because that area wasn't for standing room. (Like I said, I go often and we actually always stand on that side of the bar and it's always pretty crowded so I don't even think that's a rule.) So, we moved to the other bar and another guy came over and yelled at us AGAIN! Apparently we were still in the way. We actually tried to ask him where standing room was but he interrupted us and said either get out of the way and go outside. He was treating a group of 30ish year olds who were half a beer in like we were rowdy college kids causing a scene! It was really obnoxious. I don't think I can bring myself to give money when they treated us like they didn't even want us there.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs many people probably do, we stopped here before a Reds vs Diamondbacks baseball game. My brother and I originally rolled over to the patio by the bar and grabbed a drink and sat down. Live music? Cool. Sitting down it as loud as fawk! We moved over to the other side and waited on friends to come. Our friends came and it took forever for a server to come over. I know they are busy, and we were way early specifically there to drink before going in... so no big deal... still a bit annoying though.\n\nOnce served, she came around more often. Good! We were thirsty! Food was good. I woofed it all down, plus some of my brother's nachos.\n\n\n\n\n\nMediocre food, served by polite but apathetic servers.  Ordered a burger that was served on a bun that was so greasy that your could not hold it. Instead of taking the dish back and correcting the issue, the waitress thought it was appropriate to just bring me a different bun for my burger , drop it on the table with a statement that \"that's all we have\", and then quickly left to let me deal with reconstructing the burger myself.  The burger itself, which was supposed to be done \"medium\", was actually burned black on the outside and was bloody rare on the inside; inedible!  When I brought this to the attention of the waitress, she took it away and deducted it from my bill.  She never offered to correct the order, and never offered to bring me something else.  Thus, the total apathy.  I asked to speak to the manager about this experience.  When he finally decided to come over to my table, he displayed the same apathetic attitude as the server, and also offered nothing to correct or reconcile the situation.  Very disappointing experience.  If this place was located anywhere other than right next door to Chase Field, I don't see how it could remain a viable business.  If you are looking for a place to hang out and have a couple of beers prior to a D-Backs game, I suppose it's OK.  However, if you are looking for a place to get a bite to eat before or after the game, my suggestion is to find another place, or just wait to eat when you get inside of Chase Field.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible service, ok food. My wife ordered the D-back red rita. It showed up clear and the waitress tried to say it was \"actually not supposed to be red.\" When my wife said, \"isn't it supposed to have pomegranate?\" The waitress grabbed the drink and brought it back. Miraculously, it showed back up red. Honestly, this is the first time I remember not leaving a tip. They were out of everything and service was ridiculously slow! We got to the game 2 hours early and were wondering what we could possibly due to kill 2 hours. Well, if thats your goal this is the place for you! 2 hours was easy to kill. I was able to get 2 drinks in that time period by the way!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Seven Grill is likely still in business due to the prime location adjacent to Chase Field and the fact that if you arrive early to a game or an event, there are not many (perhaps any) other choices of places to go for a quick drink or bite before the gates open.\n\nI didn't even check Yelp prior to my visit yesterday, but as I waited in line for a couple of pre-game bloody mary drinks, I was not surprised by the 2 star average rating.\n\nOn a positive note, Game Seven Grill is super convenient to Chase Field and it has a pleasant beer garden with plenty of open seating and some games for kiddos ie: cornhole.\n\nOn a negative note, the service is awful.  I went inside to order and the bartenders were slow as molasses... When I finally got to the front of the line I learned that the drinks were pre-batched, which you would think would speed things up, but no-- not so much.  I also had to ask for olives in my drinks, and by the reaction I received, you would have thought I asked for specialty olives with bacon or additional garnish.  I got them but no service with a smile here.\n\nRegardless, I did get a decent Bloody Mary and a place to hang with friends before the D-back game... I wouldn't go out of my way to return here, but would visit again to pre-game; this time with lower expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nI can see how this place can get 1 to 2 stars but we had a good experience so this is why I give it a 4.  Due to it being GameDay the wait obviously was probably longer then normal.  The best part is the bar had no wait and we walked in and sat down right away.  \n\nOur bartender was nice and quick,  the drinks and food came out fast.  We ordered the fritter and quesadilla which were very good and paired well with the sauces served.  \n\nIt does have a upstairs and outside patio that has some games to entertain you like table tennis.   \n\nWe will be coming back when we come to anther game or just anytime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was disappointing, but the food was tasty. When we needed a drink re-made from the bar, the bartender argued that it was made correctly and offered to make another one, but we would have to buy the second drink as well. \nThe feel of the restaurant is that they're running on a shoestring, tenuous budget, and it shows in the service and the setails\n\n\n\n\n\nPros: Right next to Chase, they have beer.\n\nCons: Atmosphere is super lame, not as hip as Slider's was. It's more like going to a Chili's rather than a cool sports bar, hard to get pumped for the game there. The beer selection is limited, that's fine I usually drink domestics at sporting events. Wont find a IPA or a STOUT here though.  Staff is friendly but lacking enthusiasm. The old school Slider's Shot Girls and Beer Girls were much quicker and easier to order from (no waiting for you drink to arrive). Live music is okay but might be better post-game. The crowd seems to respond better to newer music to get pumped/ excited.  Food is fine, I had the nachoes there once, a lil' over priced but that's cause of the location. I save my money for $1.50 dogs inside Chase.\n\nmy summary: I would give GAME 7 one star but the fact that it's close to the Field and they serve beer is the only thing saving them. BRING BACK SLIDER'S\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped here before the Diamondbacks game the other night.  Our waitress was nice enough, but we had to wait a pretty long time just for an appetizer.  We had the chicken nachos and thought they were really good.  I would definitely get them again!  Beer was served in small, plastic cups which my husband wasn't a fan of.\n\n\n\n\n\nTonight was the second time I had been to the Game 7 Grill this season. I am used to buying a couple beers at this place outside before Dbacks games and have done so over the years, even as it has changed hands. Prices seem higher this year...in fact, seem about on par with beer prices inside Chase Field. \n\nTonight's game was likely the biggest crowd of the year for the Dbacks. I ordered a $6 Bud Light, in the aluminum bottle. The server advised me that they were all out of Bud Light in the bottles. That was at 5:40 pm - an hour-and-a-half before the game. Really? If I am going to get fleeced for a $6 bottle of beer, the least they can do is have it in stock! I opted for the $7 Bud Light draft and soon regretted that I had dropped any money at this place. \n\nI am done with this place. As mentioned, their prices are now about the same as inside the stadium. At least I know Chase Field is well stocked.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really enjoy a well placed sports bar...literally a few footsteps from the Danks stadium. Sat in the bar at a high top table and took a server about 15 minutes to come over to the table. We ordered a few drinks...brought one and not the other. Menu...where do I start...oh wait this is very simple. There is about 10 items to choose from total. I will say I ordered the BBQ chicken nachos and they were amazing but for some reason again took 30 minutes to come out. Keep in mind this place was not extremely busy. Horrible service overall!!\n\n\n\n\n\nExtremely disappointed with the new game 7 apparently the owners wanted a more family themed bar/restaurant which I can understand for pregame and change to menu looks good although I did not get any food. The fun ways of the old beer girls outside with a big crowd of fun is over no drink specials except for Sunday day games supposedly and drinks after the game forget about it since they close at 11 lame but they're loss in revenue, went to Coaches Corner right across the street from game 7 for after game fun and great drink specials. Bring back Sliders I always went there before and after games will not return.\n\n\n\n\n\nService is terrible. Had the opportunity to get there an hour before the game yesterday. Thought riding 45 min prior to first pitch we would be able to grab some wings. We missed first pitch by 10min. \nAlso left sunglasses at the table which was bussed immediately after (we stuck around and watched the rest of the first on tv so i saw it get busses) yet glasses were gone. Would not recommend this place to anyone and I've been going there for the last 5 seasons due to proximity. Games seven lost me and my families business.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn for a Bloody Mary before the baseball game. Staff is very friendly. Price was a surprise at 6.50. Food looked good, but, will eat later. Close to the ballpark. Nice place  to sit waiting for the gates to open.\n\n\nChef Joe surprised me with a quesadilla. Well done and thank you. Anthony my bartender has made me feel at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here before our game on Saturday. There was only one person working the bar upstairs. We waited in a long line for almost 30 minutes just to order our food. We then waited over an hour for our food to come, there was no other employees to talk to upstairs to see what was going on. We ended up leaving without the food we paid for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place needs to be on bar rescue! Came here after the game tonight and the staff was getting at each other after last call. Yelling while there is still 30 people in the building. Where's a manager to get everyone together and act like a staff!!\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the reviews it seems that the owner/managers or anyone working at this establishment do not really care too much that the service is the worst. All because they know, no matter what people will return because its closest to the stadium. The hostess was nice. The waiter was okay, seemed to be stuck w too many tables. The food was cafeteria food. Not worth it. Sadly this review won't change much but if you don't really care and only need a quick beer and crap food, this is definitely your place!\n\n\n\n\n\nNice little bar next to the baseball stadium in Phoenix. I stopped in here to have a beer before the game and was seated immediately. It got pretty busy and noisy inside and some people were standing right behind me talking quite loudly. Otherwise, service was fast and speedy despite the crowd. Got a nice cider in a glass for $5 and savored it down.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat location and bartenders. management needs to keep bathroom stocked and clean. Great atmosphere when the really good band \"Ratio\" was playing. They brought everyone's spirits up even after the loss!  Would return for the cold beer and to hear that band!\n\n\n\n\n\nI realize most people only write a review when something goes awry or they are looking to complain...unfortunately, this is one of those times.  My family and I went to Game Seven Grill on the evening before Superbowl 49, at around 7:15pm.  While we waited for a table, I used the restroom.  It was a mess, lacking in toilet paper and with mounds of wet paper on the floor.  As I returned to the hostess podium, I saw another female patron tell the manager about the condition of the bathroom, so I did not.  At that point, we were seated, at approximately seven thirty.  As with Dwayne O.'s review, we were seated in the back area of the restaurant, in the new girl's section.  Our server, was quick to greet us and take our order.  We were seated ten feet from the bar, so we guessed that our order of three sodas would not take long....we were wrong.  At 7:49 we received our drinks, nearly twenty minutes after we had been waiting.  Two bartenders were just standing behind the bar, but seemed unconcerned that we were sitting ten feet away with no drinks, no silverware and no food.  We did also notice at least five bussers who walked around with bus tubs cleaning tables and removing plates from other patrons.  When our server brought our drinks, she explained it was her first day (!) and said that someone was supposed to help her out with dropping off the drinks, but they \"sent a lot of people home.\"  On a Saturday night.  At 7:30pm.  With the Superbowl in town and hundreds of thousands of people milling around outside...Yeah, sure.  As we waited for our food, we noted a couple who sat at one of the tables beside us and then move to the bar.  They received their food before we did, as did the other two tables around us.  At 8:10, a full twenty minutes after the drinks, we received our food.  Our server again apologized and said the \"kitchen had gotten backed up\" but that did not seem to slow the service to the others around us. The menu was very limited, so we ordered two cheeseburgers and my son ordered wings.  The burgers were okay; nothing special and I could not taste the pepper jack cheese on my burger.  My son, 12, eats anything...and I mean anything.  However, he could only eat four of his eight wings because they were a touch too tough and over-sauced.  He got 8 wings for $10.95 with no side...clearly a disappointment.  When we were finally finished, we spoke with the manager at the hostess station.  I explained our disappointment, he apologized several times and said there was nothing he could do for this experience, just the next one and I assured him there would be no \"next one\". As a former restaurant server and manager, I can honestly say that I will never again visit Game Seven Grill.\n\n\n\n\n\nI try to live by the 'Golden Rule' so I will try it in this review and see what happens???  Rating Scale 1-5 like the stars above. Service : 1 \nFood: 3 \nAdd both: 4 \nDivided by 2 = 2 Stars \nThen the question, \"Did we get our money's worth? Uh, not sayin'. Now I want you to understand, that's the question one should always think about after any purchase! Let me close this review with the line from the Disney movie classic, \"Bambi\", Thumper speaking- \"If you can't say sometin' nice, don't say notin' at all.\"; The food was okay. I'm out!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe location is outstanding, but the menu is bland and the drinks are quite overpriced. Service is about what you'd expect, but the place has possibilities. I'll be watching for signs of new management and/or ownership ...when I see it, I'll be back again for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is decent but the service is behind horrible.  Sheriff Joe provides better service in the jail to the inmates.  I'd recommend going hungry and thirsty over this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was slower than slow. It took 50 minutes to arrive. Food was crap. Not worth what they charged for it. If you want to get into Chase Stadium at a decent time do NOT stop here first.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've only visited here before games for drinks so I can't comment on the food just yet... it's a little pricey for me.  Some days, I am perfectly content with settling for a dirty dollar hot dog in the ballpark.  That's what baseball games are for.  \n\nGame Seven is always packed... be ready to make some new friends; the bar is super crowded before the first pitch.  All of the vodka sodas I've had here... mehh, they seem pretty weak... they have a nice selection on tap so I am a fan of that.\n\nI love that they have other baseball games playing at the bar... I guess you'd expect that from a sports grill.  And I love all of the dbacks memorabilia.  That makes me happy.  They usually have live music playing before the games.  Great place to sit & people watch before the game... probably the most entertaining thing about this place.\n\nAll in all, good place to have a beer before the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here tonight the night before Super Bowl 49 at around 7;30 pm. With Super Bowl Central Downtown I was going to give up on eating downtown but noticed there was not a line to get in which should have been a sign.\n\nOnly had to wait 5 minutes and were seated as far from the entrance as possible and I thought this is going to be bad because we were tucked in a corner away from everyone else. We sat there for over 10 minutes  with no one that ever came to our table to even acknowledge us. My wife asked one of the people if there was some one to take our order and a nice person came over to get our drinks. The sad thing was we found out our real waitress walked by us a number of times without even talking to us. Her name was Merideth. The other person who was to setup the beer garden took our order and was the one who got our drinks, when she got our order she told us today was her first day. After we got our food and we were almost done eating Merideth came by to finally acknowledge us and then asked us about our drinks. I told my wife Merideth did not deserve a penny and a the tip should have gone to the other peraon.\n\nAs for the food, the menu consists of wings, one burger, pulled pork sandwich and 2 pizzas.\n\nI ordered the burger medium and came out well, the fries were good and the bun was too big for the burger patty. It came with lettuce tomato and onions.\n\nThe pulled pork sliders were good and topped with a tasty bbq sauce.\n\nWe also had the cheese pizza which the top was half burnt.\n\nThe wings were meaty.\n\nShould have not eaten here and the service did not exist.\n\nWill not come back and hope you don't either. Service absolutely  was terrible except the new girl. She gives this place one star.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. Just...no.\nJoke of a menu, bad food, bad service, bad atmosphere, overpriced. \n\nMy husband and I came here for dinner and a beer before the game, and it was the worst. The service was timely enough, but the server couldn't answer any of our questions. I asked if the Schreiner's sausage was served whole, like a hot dog, or shaved on a hamburger bun. \"I'm not sure, sorry.\" Okay.... We also asked if they had XX Lager or amber, and she said amber. I thought it was weird because the lager is so common, but dismissed it...until I saw someone walk away from the bar with a lager. Then, when she came back to take our order, the busser walked by and she flat out interrupted my husband in order to tell the busser something, to which he replied that the lady at another table needed a refill. It was...awkward. Especially because the restaurant wasn't even busy! In keeping with the theme, our server came and dropped the check, picked it up, and brought it back without ever speaking a word to us. \n\nSo, anyway, I got nachos ($12?!). The chicken that came on them was like rubber, and in huge long pieces that needed to be cut to fit into a bite. Nachos are not a fork and knife friendly food. The cheese sauce was gross and the chips were hard, and the sour cream was a laughable little squeeze. My husband got the 3 pulled pork sliders ($10), which came without sauce which is weird, and on dry bland buns. The fries were okay. We left well over half our food untouched. It's a disappointing way to waste $40, especially when there are so many great places close by.\n\nI would only suggest coming here for a drink before the game if everywhere else is packed and you MUST be right by the gates.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery crowded with all my fellow Yankees fans drinking a cold one pregame. The fact that this place has two wells outside serving beer is the saving grace. Two other bars (Alice and Dugout) were impossible to enter and even if you got inside, getting a beer was difficult. At this bar, they had beer stations on opposite sides on the patio and getting a brew was easy and quick. Once the Yankees leave, it will be even easier. Got a cold Miller Lite Bottle and a  Corona for 11 bucks and right into the stadium. Good stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in with friends before watching the Dbacks lose another game. The restaurant setting is fitting for the area and has a lot of television viewing options for sports fans. The food and drink options were adequate and I would have to say that the food was better than I was expecting for a sporting environment. I had the beer battered brisket fritters and tried my friend's venom wings. One perk to yelping is getting to eat others food. :) The fritters were very good and I would recommend them. Venom wings on the other hand lacked any bite but were flavorful.  A fellow friend did arrive a bit later and attempted to finish their XXX Hottest Wings and failed. He did give a valiant effort but was only able to finish 3 of 8. I have no idea how his wings tasted given this guys stomach would have lasted all of one bite. The smell of death was enough for me. Only real issue for me was the service. As others have mentioned, the time to get food and drinks was very slow. We regularly had to flag staff down to get drinks. They were all friendly enough, just slow for pregame food and drinks. Would give the place another shot given those fritters:)\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service, great food, and great drinks.  \n\nThe manager Reggie was very accommodating to our large party.  He made sure we were happy  \n\nI'll definitely come here again!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dbacks are playing the Royals today so my friends and I were standing in line to wait to enter the game. We decided to head to Game 7 Grill, the hostess was quick in getting us a seat, we let her know we didn't want to be late for the game. We sat and our waitress Josie was full of energy and made us laugh. While looking at the menu I saw that there was so many amazing options. Since there was six of us we ordered two nachos, a pretzel bread, pork sliders, two brisket quesadillas, and a vegetable flatbread. The cheese sauce and chicken on the nachos were to die for. Wait everything I tasted was amazing I was truly being selfish with my meal. we paid for our meal and left to go to the game. I read other people's reviews and I have to say I didn't experience any bad vibe with this place. However I can say my waitress was a delight to be near other servers didn't look so happy but their bad moods didn't bother us. All and all we would come back again and try everything next time. Come here it is nice and they have a smoker which gets me excited because I am a texas girl. this is a nice place to drink a beer take a shot whatever you like and spend time with friends..... Shout out to all the cooks your dedication shows.\n\n\n\n\n\nTook 15 minutes for a waitress to arrive after being sat at our table. Waitress could not tell us what was on tap or provide a list of available beers. Took another 15 minutes for our drinks to be served. Specifically asked for lemons and lime wedges which never came. Waitress never asked if we wanted food. Waitress left an empty serving tray at our table for about 10 minutes. Very unimpressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff is horrible. Got an eye roll from the bartender when I ordered iced tea. Actually, it was more of a snarl. Got a highball glass full of ice with about 3 ounces of tea. We got moved from a corner where we weren't in anyone's way to a through way where tons of people needed to get by. 1st and last time I go in there!", "useful": 0.6666666666666666, "cool": 0.4019607843137255, "funny": 0.27450980392156865, "date": "2013-09-01 20:09:49"}, "6": {"business_id": "-0tgMGl7D9B10YjSN2ujLA", "business_name": "Dubliner", "address": "3841 E Thunderbird Rd, Ste 111", "attributes": "{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Ambience': \"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}\", 'NoiseLevel': \"u'average'\", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': \"u'casual'\", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Alcohol': \"u'full_bar'\", 'WiFi': \"'no'\", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'Music': \"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': True, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}\", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True'}", "categories": "None", "city": "Phoenix", "hours": "{'Monday': '11:0-2:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-2:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-2:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-2:0', 'Friday': '11:0-2:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-2:0', 'Sunday': '10:0-2:0'}", "postal_code": "85032", "review_count": 130, "stars": 3.5, "state": "AZ", "review": "Prob just a good place to drink, see live music. I've been many different times of day and days of week over the years. The food is always bad. The service varies. If you order a burger you're prob ok. Who can screw that up? Otherwise, drink, play darts, maybe meet some slutty Chics.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally enjoyed the crowd, live music, and friendly service from our server (Heather)when we checked out this place back in March. My bff and I were in town for a Ragnar Relay and staying with a local friend, who brought us here the night we got in. Unfortunately, it was too late to get any food (but Del Taco isn't far!) But we still enjoyed chatting at a table and listening to live music. Prices were good and service was outstanding!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat live music! I used to go here a lot more but it still one my favorite bars. Saint Patty's day here is crazy!. Pretty good food and always decent drinks. Recommend it for getting a group of friends together and chillin\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Brad T. said.\n\n\ndone.\n\n\nWhat? I have to write more?  OK, here's a little more:\n\n-real people, not just a pretty crowd\n-music can get really loud, but that's not necessarily a bad thing\n-great prices on pitchers of beer\n-kick back relaxed environment\n-fun for people watching\n\n\n\n\n\nalways a good crowd and mix of ppl usually. they have some really talented local musicians and then on the other side they have darts. i just wish they had more dart tables b/c half the time they are taken. the food is average with disgusting fried mushrooms as one of the options-yuck and olives in a quesidalla-also yuck. some of the bartenders are better than others. its very laid back compared to a scottsdale bar as far as dress which is why i like it but its not too hole-in-the wall were its boring or dirty.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat wings.. Excellent personable bartenders.. Also I asked for \" some extra celery and carrots \" with my wings and assumed id get 2-3... They gave me a whole plate of it with extra ranch and BLEU CHEESE! .. The traditional Irish fare like the sheppards pie is absolutely terrific and the Irish soda bread was really delicious.. I been back 2 times and the food is great .. Every time\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways awesome service always different people to chat with, always great food. Many of the staff have been here. Long time and they remember you, feels good to hang here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place can get really awesome or really dull dependent on one solitary man resembling a leprechaun with a filthy mouth and penchant for calling out mouthy toolbags, all while playing the guitar and happily caroling away in Irish drinking hymnals.  It can get really crowded, which makes standing really tedious and plants a target on your big forehead for the leprechaun to abuse.  On St. Paddy's Day, this place is chaos, and like most other forced holidays is not worth getting into the carnival atmosphere just to say you did it.  Cash-only holidays get old in a hurry.\n\n\n\n\n\nI only recommend this place during the off hours if your here for food. In my case that was between 4 and 5. We got good service, but I could sense if this place was busy, service would be a problem. That would be for food, but just getting something to drink, come anytime.\n\nWe were not ignored, but I felt the waitress should of check up on how we were doing just one more time.(not spoiled ok). Me and the wife both got fish and chips, plus slaw. Not bad, we both agreed. I would come here again, but as I said, only on the slow, off hours. \n\nBartender seemed to draw the crowd, as he was very charismatic as a whole. Majority of the crowd was between 45 and 65. Clean restrooms. Decor was average to slightly above average for a Irish pub. Don't let the outside look fool you. Lots of parking. Especially back further. Safe location.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible service.  Waited 45 minutes from sandwich this place had 7 people in it unbelievable.  The sheriff spent more time complaining about not having enough help instead of servicing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place looks small from the outside but don't let that fool you. It's so cool inside. First time here with a friend and it will be a favorite forever. Our server was Michelle, she was so kind & not the 'overly friendly' type that annoy me.  \n\nThe food is great & if you want to watch the game there are tv's everywhere!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the chicken fries which were awesome!  Good beer selection, TV, pool, darts....live music....uh what else do you want in an irish bar?\n\nI frequent this place when looking for live music during the week.  Cold pints are a plus and the clientele seems very friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace is cool to come and relax and forget about the outside.. No rush just a nice chill atmosphere, kinda slow but the crowd and price are good. If you are in a rush I would suggest Taco Bell. Almost all nights here there is a large crowd and some decent dart players.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was a regular customer at The Dubliner. When I tragically lost a close friend I went to Dubliner while I was grieving and Chris the bartender was very respectful and sincere with me. One of the owners, John, has been social with me and we've had some insightful political conversations. But on the night of October 23rd 2015 one of the managers, Tara, treated me very poorly. So poorly that I will never step foot in that establishment again. Professionalism is a foreign idea to her. Taras child like behavior was uncanny and on display when she confronted me in front off the bar. Pretty sad really.\n\n\n\n\n\nTonight I sat in to listen to take cover! I wish this comfortable neighborhood bar would focus on good food and affordable drinks because the live \"entertainment\" has been a let down.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas here tonight.  It is OK!  Not much Irish things on the menu, more of a bar food type joint.  Potatoe skins were meh.  The paddy o melt was meh too.  The live music was a plus.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is near my house. Haven't visited it until recently but it's a nice quiet place. Golden tee is probably the second best thing they have, the first being Guinness on draft. Would definitely recommend this place if you're interested in a quiet place with good service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very good neighborhood bar.  Definite Irish feel to it.  The food is decent, and the drinks are great.  It can get pretty crowded on the weekends.  They have a pretty great party on St. Patrick's day, take up the entire parking lot of the shopping mall they are in... pretty good time...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dubliner is not an authentic Irish Pub but it is one of my favorite bars to go to because the crowd is down to earth and drinks are CHEAP. Where else can you get a red bull vodka for $4? The crowd is a diverse mix of hipsters, hippies, skaters, and a few old weirdos here and there. If you went to high school in the area your bound to run into someone you haven't seen in years. I always have a great time when I go to the Dubliner because I meet such interesting people. You can find me here when I don't feel like dressing up for Scottsdale.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has been around forever and was a favorite when I lived in Phoenix in the 90s.  Reasonably priced drinks and good food and still that way today in 2014.  They have expanded the other side of the bar which is nice. \n\nI have to give a shout out to Vanessa who works the day shifts.  She is super friendly, great service and seems to know all the regulars by name. She made me feel right at home on Saturday.  I even went back again today.   The pulled pork sandwich was delicious.  I wanted something sweet today and she brought out this chocolate chip cookie that was still hot with vanilla ice cream melting over it.  It was wonderful.\n\nIf I can swing it I may come by a third time before I leave this is how fond I am of the place. They have live music some evenings I think.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it isnt in St Louis LOL\n\nSeriously, stop by.  It is in a strip mall at Thunderbird and 40th on the SW corner two doors down from the dentist.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \" Dub\" as my friends refer to it as is my local Pub that i roll when i just want to have a relaxed and fun  time.  Some of my favorite parts of the pub include the live music that is offerened almost 7 days a week and the nice variety of people who enter the establishment.  Friday and Saturday like most places is the Dubliner's busiest night when it is rather busy.  There are some things that could be improved on including better drink prices and more game options.  Overall this is a fun place but not the flashest or most hip.  The crowd is not always the most attractive either. but get a couple of Blue Moons in yah and even the 63 biker chick in the corner will start to look a little better\n\n\n\n\n\nAw, I can't vote zero stars?  The service is the worst I've ever had EVER. I asked for menus ... apparently not.  Had to go physically get a menu from behind the bar.  Asked to order and the waitress said she'd be right back.  Spent the next half hour trying to get her attention - no such luck. When I finally got to order my food, it was another half hour before I got to eat it.  I'm sorry, but when I go somewhere to eat, I'm HUNGRY and I'm not happy when I'm hungry.  Waiting over an hour to eat is just bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite places to visit in Scottsdale. They have great food, drink specials, live music, and fun games (SONGO). One of the best Irish Pub's I've been to.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was great.  Loved the trivia night. My problem is the food and furnishing.  First - ordered the \"Shepherds Pie\" .... grainy thin mashed potatoes over hamburger/veggies that was over cooked and under spiced.  Little to no flavor.  Covered by a boiling hot thick layer of shredded cheese.  No Bueno.  My dining companion had the guiness chicken.  He questioned if the chicken was cooked through.  It was rubbery.  Flavor on the sauce was ok, but the veggies tased old - as if they'd been in the fridge for a few days.  Sorry - not a fan.\n\nThe table where we sat was showing it's age - the finish was wearing off and everytime I bumped up against the edge - my shirt pulled a few slivers off and imbedded them in the material.  I spent a few moments on the ride home pulling them out.\n\nA good powerwash and some dusting might help as well as some maintenance work on the furnishings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was good.  I had the wrap and it was great.  Beer selection was below average and they were out of two different selections listed on their menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent Sunday for afternoon games for football. Packers bar (shocking! what bar in AZ isn't?) Place was pretty busy. Had two seats at the bar for us to sit. Bartender was nice and efficient, drinks were good. \n\nAs for the food, small portions, not all that tasty. Ordered a caesar salad to share, wasn't large enough. For $9 (mind you, no meat, just lettuce, cheese, dressing and croutons) we thought we'd get a pretty good size salad. Had a baked potato and mashed potatoes/gravy for our \"sides\". Gravy wasn't cooked right, portion again, small. Took 45 mins to get the three items. Bartender claimed they only had two fryers, so the kitchen was behind. However, we didn't have fried food items. \n\nOverall, we will go back. Gal next to us ordered a reuben that looked life changing. So... until next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm 31 yrs old and I've come to the Dub since I was an 18 yr old with a good fake ID. I actually havent lived in Az in over 10 yrs, but when ever I come back to visit friends and family this is our spot. My buddies have been the local crew at this bar for over a decade. The bartenders have all worked here for years as well, and even tho i may only come in a few times a year, the bartenders always remember my face. A fun atmoshphere, plenty of room, a non-stuffy, non-scottsdale type crowd. When I'm in Az, I always visit the Dub...\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't believe I'm going to say authentic & Irish in the same sentence as \"located in a Phx plaza\" but I will. One of the best, most Irish restaurants I've ever dined at. Great entertainment as well.\n\n\n\n\n\njust left there, wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. No one in there eating except me. I sat at the bar so it would be quicker. Food took almost a half an hour and was Stone Cold and greasy. I went to the bathroom because I was getting ready to leave when the food came. I think the bartender forgot to  check for  my order  or didn't even realize it was sitting in the back. She was on her phone the whole time. Chardonnay wine was room temperature. Had to ask for ice. Her explanation was their coolers suck.  when I asked to have a second glass, she poured it right on top of the other one. Same pore, maybe 4 oz. Have been there on Sunday mornings and have had a good experience. will not be back,,,,  shocker\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visited the Dubliner on a Monday night, and it was open mike night.  Yay!  Where I'm from, that's not usually a good thing.  The Dubliner, on the other hand, had some fantastic talent on this particular evening.  Some great acoustic guitar and voices, definitely.  Too bad more people weren't there to hear and enjoy but hey, like I said, it was a Monday.  \n\nI like the atmosphere here.  It's dark, they have darts, a large bar, and two or three separate big spaces.  The patrons were friendly and non-pretentious.  Tap selection is small but they had what we wanted!  Since I'm not from the Phoenix area, I get Kiltlifter anywhere I can when I'm in town.   The tap was fresh, and it was delicious.  THREE of the beers my bf ordered were out, so he had to wait while kegs were changed every time he ordered.  He didn't mind since it meant his beer was fresh.  The bartender we had wasn't very friendly or helpful.  She paid attention to us, but the guy next to me may as well have been invisible.  I had to get her attention so he could order a drink.  I don't know what that was about, but if it would have been me not receiving service, I would knock out two stars. \n\nWhile we didn't order any food, I thought the menu looked really good.  Honestly, we have driven by the Dubliner many times and mentioned trying it out but never did until now.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Phoenix!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood traditional Irish bar food. Service staff flows well in chaotic situations. Roomy and has multiple bars.\n\nLive entertainment and traditional Irish fare. If you are a good old Irish boy like me, hit this place Early before the wanna be Irish people start to flow in.\n#vinosquared #vino2ultimate\n\n\n\n\n\nFull bar, happy hour specials and traditional Irish Fare. I've been twice and been happy each time. Husband got \"Boxty\" chicken in gravy folded in a pancake - its fantastic. I always get a garden salad with chicken, which is fresh, hearty and healthy. Happy to say this will be a regular stop for us! Service has always been good.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Irish bars, and I was happy to have found this one while my wife was shopping. The ambiance is authentic, the beer is cold and tasty (don't order American light beer, you would look like an idiot), the Guinness is on draft and perfectly pored and the waitress attentive. Sit at the bar and meet new people.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dig the Dubliner.  It is a great place to grab a bite and a brew while enjoying local, live music.  They have a great beer selection, full bar and an extensive (for a bar) food menu.  I have only had the sweet potato fries, but they were cooked to crispy perfection.  I wish I could give Dubliner more stars, but there are a couple of things that drive me bonkers about this place.  First and foremost,  there is always a mob of people sitting outside the front door smoking.  There is no way to circumvent the raunchy cloud of toxins.  I wish they would move the smoking area a few feet further from the door (maybe in the back/side parking area, hint, hint).  Also, on Friday and Saturday nights there are not enough servers here.  Service at the bar is usually prompt, but if you are at a table, good luck!  You are probably better off burning a calorie or three and walking to the bar for your next round, than waiting for a server to come to you.  It's not that they are slacking, there just aren't enough of them.  Add another server or two when the place is packed, get the smoke out of my face, then I'd up this to a four star rating.\n\nStop by the Dubliner, and support a local band/musician!\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby is a very rude server. She has no personality considering she works at the bar. Food is very dry and takes a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nTired is the best word to describe this place.  We've lived by it for a long time and thought we'd give it a try.  What a mistake!  No one greets you, no sign to tell you to sit wherever, and no waitress showing up to acknowledge you are there.  When she finally did, it was quite obvious she didn't want to be there.\n\nShepard's pie - made with hamburger instead of lamb.  I thought I'd try it anyway.  When I saw the presentation - I should have sent it back.  A big glob of a dish with everything spilling everywhere.  And a ton of cheese melted on top - not a normal ingredient in SP.  Plain, boring, no spice whatsoever.  Hubby's hamburger was a frozen patty - no creativity at all - yet it's called the \"Dubliner\".  \n\nIf you want a dive bar, go for it.  If you want real food, turn around and go somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been awhile since I have visited the Dubliner. The only reason I haven't frequented the place lately is because I don't live near them anymore so I can't just either walk home or call a cab for 5 min ride. However there drinks are strong and cheap! Either that or the bartender was being very friendly on the few times I have visited :) The food is not to shabby either. I mean you can't possibly mess up fish and chips. Hmm fish and chips. So go, check it out, but remember if you have too many, call a cab. Did I mention that their drinks are strong and cheap! #winwin!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dubliner will be a long time staple. It's a great go-to bar for happy hour, post-dinner, or whatever\nfloats your boat. There are darts, that Hunter arcade game, as well as karaoke, and live bands. \n\nThe staff is always super friendly and they make you feel welcome. The drinks are not overly priced. It's a good place to sit for hours drinking pitchers of beer and relaxing.\n\nThe food is standard bar fare with some Irish menu items as well. For dessert, they have bread pudding which I haven't had the chance to try yet but the large baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream was decent. \n\nDon't expect anything fancy. The charm is kind of divey and unpretentious.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food.  Plenty of football.  Awesome prices,  Chill atmosphere.  Best cheese fries in the neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good home town watering hole. Great mellow/casual atmosphere to meet and hangout with friends. My friends and I have been going here as long as I can remember. The bar staff has largely remained the same for years; get to know em' and you'll know them for a long time. This is a pub of pubs. If you are looking for a \"home\" bar.. this is the place for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is OK. I have never eaten there but have been to drink many times.  It's a pretty big place.  There's a good mix of people and age groups and seems like a lot of people take dates here.  The security staff here are kinda douche bags. \n\nThe worst part about this bar though is the fights. There is always fighting here. A fight here and there can be entertaining but its old and annoying when there is a fight every single time I go.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highlight of this place is that they actually have Kilkenny on tap, one of my favorite beers. \n\nThat's about it. The place is very dark, and most of the people that come here are trash. Washed out biker types and the local punks. \n\nThey have darts which is a nice touch.\n\nThey loose points for having armed security walking about. It makes me really uncomfortable for these guys to be open carrying in a bar. There is absolutely no reason to have armed bouncers. If the place is that dangerous, they should have a uniformed officer stationed outside.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigured I would give the place a try since I work just across the street. Worst service in my life!!!! Have sat for 20 minutes with out anyone coming around to take an order or even acknowledged. It wasn't busy at all!!!! Finally after waiting so long I got up and left. Won't be back if this is how the service is.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo utensils or ketchup were provided after I ordered and received my food. Asked for ketchup afterwards and was provided but just wasn't impressed with this bar at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nA dude playing irish music on a fiddle in a bar in North Phoenix?  Count me in.\n\nThis is a pretty good pub-y place with your traditional attempt at irishness (stew, shepherd's pie, bangers & mash) with a few irish beers (guinness, of course, harp & smithwick's) while also having your traditional bar food.\n\nNothing fancy, everything is pretty straightforward.  Probably really a 3 star place, but the live entertainment adds a bonus star.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place to grab a beer and listen to some music. The prices are great and the staff is friendly. Low key and and relaxed environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the manager's away, the staff will do absolutely nothing but try to get laid and ignore paying customers. Really sad because we've been here a lot over the last few years, and always had a good experience. \n\nLast night, it was like everyone got stoned and forgot they were actually working. It wasn't even busy, and we repeatedly had to track down our server to ask for drinks, food, and the check. \n\nIt was so bad, all of the tables around us cashed out, and started going to the bar for drinks... When we followed suit, we had to actually go track down the bartender (who was busy chatting with a young blonde at the of the bar) and tell him we wanted to order drinks. He took our order, but then wandered off to go talk to the blonde again! Really???!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place.  The staff are awesome, they have live music six nights a week, and the clientele are 99% douche free.  Never tried the food, but who the hell goes to a bar to eat, anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to have your rights violated by uneducated security guard and evening plans ruined head to the Dubliner. \nGuess what Complain Submitted to DPS.\nHorrible Place avoid at all cost !!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood bar vibe...Arizona civil war college football games were playing the night I was here so the crowd was great, and the elderly gentleman playing old Irish tunes on the stage up front added to the lively environment. Was in a strip mall setting and I was visiting from out of town so I would have not noticed it had my friend not taken me here. Still though, love my Irish pubs, whiskey,  and Guinness.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy fiance and I go here weekly and the service and food are amazing. Great dive and highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing to this place, the food was alright, the serves was just ok and the band playing there was horrid, I don't see myself ever going back here ever!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo normally I like this place and the corned beef and cabbage have been quite good... but, on this occasion, the chef was clearly not irish or familar with irish food & culture, because the dish was dreadful. How to you ruin corened beef a...nd cabbage?? The urge to tell them how to make it was a compelling one. \n\nI'll go back because it's been decent in the past, and the beer flows freely and good, usually with good company, but, I'm thinking it's a one more chance kind of thing. Sadly, there are few places in phoenix that claim to be 'irish' that serve authentic quality irish food. I think if your going to cook food of another culture, you should at least learn how it's properly prepared and served.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've  had drink here a few times in the last year or so and the guinness is always just right on and service is normally pretty good.\n\nLast night we went to Friday Night Fish Fry..... and I'm sad to say it was horrible. 1st we waited nearly an hour to get our food. My boyfriend had the Fish Fry and I had the Chicken Boxty. 2nd when our food finally arrived the fish was more fish jerky than fish fry. My Chicken Boxty was just sad.... I was given a plate of chicken gravy with a plain breakfast pancake covering it. Not a potato pancake like your traditional boxty. I picked through the pancake trying to find some potato and couldn't find any.  Needless to say I more or less had side of broccoli for dinner.\n\nUnfortunately it is unlikely we will return after this.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were really looking forward to some good Irish grub, unfortunately, it didn't happen here. The Shepherd's Pie \"gravy\" was watery and tasteless, and there wasn't much meat. The irish stew was cold and and bland. The wait staff was nice, but service was lacking. Everything took a long time, and the most disappointing was dessert. Though the bread pudding was good, we asked for ice cream on it,  and the waitress waited too long to bring it to our table so the ice cream was almost completely melted. Won't be returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here on a Saturday night; the place was pretty busy. We ordered food around 9pm so the kitchen stays open late so that is a plus. We got a burger and sweet potato fries - both very good. Try the sweet pototo fries with the plum sauce - yummy!\nDrinks were reasonably priced and the wait staff was friendly and prompt. No complaints from me. \nThey had a bad playing too that was good, but it was rock. I sort of expected an irish type band to be playing especially on a weekend night. The band was still good though, don't get me wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nA local favorite of mine.  Doesn't look like much on the outside, but a suprisingly decent menu and full bar.  Always live music, which is my favorite part.  All types are welcome here, but it can get busy at times and they never seem to be staffed for it, so don't be too upset it it takes a while for your drinks.  If you're tired of the crowds that frequent the clubs in Scottsdale, want some good food and live music, you will have a great time at the Dubliner.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy group, Arizona Caledonians, celebrated Robbie Burns Night there last month. It was brilliant. My friend, Irene loved the food, drink. The Binty was tasty, although too much broccoli. Broccoli should be optional. *LOL* We all had a lovely time. They need more selection in single malt scotches. Kilt lifter Ale was in abundance. I'd give the place 100 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree of us came here on a Friday night at about 7:30. The waitress was too busy socializing with her friends at a nearby table to actually do much for us. She couldn't remember how much a pitcher of beer was. We found out at the end of the night that they are $17! A little pricey considering this is a dive bar with broke-looking customers such as ourselves! :-P The food was ok, once we got it. My booth seat was broken and it would fall inside of itself if I leaned on it wrong. That could be embarrassing if I wasn't careful! The main thing is the service was horrible. We left early and won't be going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is freaking amazing but the service is decent. Super laid back bar that I totally dig, I just wish the servers were more attentive. I usually sit at the bar top and get amazing service. It was also a slow day when we went.. it was during happy hour and we still had to wait about 10 mins to get serve.. about 10 mins to get our food order in and about 20 mins after our meal to get the check. Also my boyfriend ordered a Budweiser and received a warm bud light. However hands down the best spinach dip in town!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visited again. Open mic night is actually Sunday, not Monday. This time we ordered food. I had a philly; it was unremarkable, but it was edible. The beer was still good. \n\nUnfortunately, the patronage left much to be desired. We initially sat at the bar. The big guy two seats over was loudly discussing his personal information with lots of graphic details and use of the eff bomb every three or four words. After about five minutes or so of this, we decided to move to another part of the bar. I know it's a bar and after a night of drinking, conversation flows, and it's not always nice. \n\nAs we passed a large drunk man sitting alone at the end of the bar, he confronted my bf about \"walking by without speaking.\". Look. We are from Kansas and this is the second time we have been here ever. Why would we speak to this man?  My bf smiled and indicated we were just there to eat. The man then confronted ME and demanded to know if I was a girlfriend or a wife. When we moved a second time to escape, this goon followed us and put his hands on my bf. I thought it was all over. My bf minds his own business, but he does not take kindly to confrontational people. The bouncer was about six feet away, but apparently this dude is a regular, so he was allowed to harass us. Bouncer did eventually call a cab, but until it arrived, this man was allowed to teeter around the bar touching people and getting into their business. \n\nI have no desire to return to The Dubliner after this experience. It could be a cool place, but a couple of seedy characters and the staff's inattention to their incredibly offensive behavior have spoiled it for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nOi! The Dubliner!\n\nLove this place. Short walk from my house, which is good after about 26 kiltlifters....\n\nBest freaking wings I think I have ever had... like seriously, they have a magician back there. \n\nFun place, good people, good vibes. Never have seen any type of problems happen here which is rare for any bar in Phoenix. \n\nThis place has a very interesting dynamic. There are old heads and regulars and then a younger crowd. Makes for great conversations and social interactions. Bartender is cool, Dave I think. \n\nDon't change your ways Dubliner...\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I were in the Phoenix area, and wanted to find a good Irish Pub.  We luckily found the Dubliner.  Chris the bartender was great, along with all of the other bartenders (sorry didn't get their names).  The drinks are great, food is great, and the atmosphere is also great (not too many greats?).  Highly recommended for food, drink, music, atmosphere.  One of the best fish and chips that I have ever had, anywhere.  My wife loves the BLT's as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food, good drink specials. Friendly management and most of the staff are friendly and efficient. Tara has always treated me like family! This bar has been my favorite for eight years and counting! P.S. Try the fried pickles! Mind blowing. Keep it up, guys!\n\n\n\n\n\nDive bar, live music, friendly servers, lots of regulars. They have Irish bar food that's decent, but don't go in expecting a great meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here while my sister was in town to play trivia on Monday night. Had a good time and was able to bring my 13 year old along. Corned beef sliders were amazing. The rest of the Irish food was subpar. Chicken boxty had very little flavor.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a fun place to hang out! I was visiting my friend in the area and this was a fun place to go on Saint Patrick's day. There are specials were kind of pricey like $10 for a green tea shot which tasted just like a Tokyo Iced Tea and was too sweet.  I got a Moscow Mule in the copper mug and I thought it was adorable how my friend got a beer with a Guinness shot on the side in a little plastic shot glass that hung on it! They have Skee ball here and a Photo Booth! It's a very spacious area with a very fun crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nawe, the food was OK for bar food, it was a little too loud for me last night though!\nService was ok to good.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis a great improvement on service and friendly service.  Food is a great value and always hot as orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place for what it is: a neighborhood Irish dive. You cannot rate this place on any other scale. Yes, the furniture is old and faded. The food is not made by a top chef. One does not visit the Dubliner for an amazing sit-down meal and 5-star service; you come for light beer and shots, the live music, and the neighborhood crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food.  Plenty of football.  Awesome prices,  Chill atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish breakfast (aka a fry) used real Irish sausages, bacon and black and white pudding! Soda/brown bread was lovely and served with plenty of butter. Worth a try. Sausages could have been a little more evenly browned. Potatoes were under cooked but seasoned really well. Unfortunately they overpowered the flavor of the fry. Personally I prefer home fries that are more like cubed French fries (aka chips) without the onions (although they were very tasty). The baked beans weren't cooked enough either but overall it was a pretty good taste of home in a pinch. Staff and service was awesome. Place has a real country Irish Bar feel.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've lived across the street for almost 4 years now and finally went in for some beer and food.   The beers were great, nice and cold. Their food was pretty good too for a bar.  The main issue with this place is the waitresses.  They all seem to be in a bad mood all the time.  Unless you're a regular, you will be treated like a bother.  I've been there 3 times, different waitress each time, and all very blah.  The bar itself is much bigger than it looks on the outside, and has a lot of tvs for sports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wednesday night entertainment is AMAZING. Excellent musician and performer. Makes you laugh while enjoying great music. It can be hard to flag down the waitress, wish they had menus sitting at the table so you could flip through while you waited so you didn't have to wait to flag down the waitress to GET the menu and then wait to flag down the waitress to order. The fries are quite tasty but eat them up while they are warm. Prices are good. \nThere are darts and a foosball table which are fun to do!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the Irish bar in its purest form. \n\nPlenty of dart boards line the walls and pitchers float around by the dozen. There are a few long drinking hall style tables which are always entertaining for big groups. The service staff is no-nonsense, but good. The crowd is my favorite aspect at the Dubliner. None of the typical Scottsdale attitudes and cheeziness will be found here . . . and if it is, it won't stay long. \n\nGood live music takes it up a notch and puts it into the top five of my favorite bars in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally we love the Dubliner, but I have to tell you Saturday night, it was awful. \nMy husband got a bacon cheeseburger and was very disappointed. The burger was totally bland. No seasoning what so ever. \nI had the corned beef and cabbage and same thing. Very unseasoned. The potatoes were so awful and the cabbage was just boiled. Not with the corned beef and again, no seasoning. \nThe our server was terrible. We waited forever for our drinks and had to flag down another server to get another beer. \nAll in all, just not the same as we had come to expect.\n\n\n\n\n\nI come here in the afternoon when there is not a crowd. A good friend lives close by and she loves the fried pickles (which are quite yummy), so it's our meeting place of choice. They have my favorite cheap Irish whiskey, tullemore dew. We can always get a booth. The wait staff is attentive. I'll come back!\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is decent.  Service is above average.  Solid small draft beer selection. Good atmosphere.  Had music setting up.\n\n\n\n\n\nLive a block from this place. Good food and friendly staff. Come here at least once a week. Live bands on the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nFogo the bartender here was very conversational and provided excellent service. Will definitely come here again!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the neighborhood Irish pub of choice in the area. I've been coming here for 30 years ( sweet lord I am old) , since my father brought me here for Irish nachos. The Guinness is not too cold, the jukebox is not too loud, the Jameson is reasonably priced and THE WATERS PLAY HERE. Slinte! Also.  Devin maybe the best bartender in the world!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friend has brought me here a couple times, only on Mondays for trivia. Team Trivia is quiet entertaining, I must say. It's free to play, which is a nice bonus. If you want a good laugh, each team makes their own name up, some inappropriate, but funny though. I have ordered food, it's not bad, for bar food.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have only been here once, but sadly will not be returning again.\n\nOn a lighter note, I actually thought the restaurant itself was pretty cool and I also even liked the food. Both the Shepherd's Pie and the Corned Beef were quite good!\n\nSo why won't I come back here? One of the staff was extremely rude to one of my friends and made her feel completely unwelcome. It was especially bad, because he was a manager. She brought a problem to him and he basically told her he didn't care and didn't need her business. I didn't catch all of what went on myself, because it was a loud place with music playing, but a big thing for me is the way that the management treats their customers. We ended up leaving earlier than we had planned, because my friend got offended by the manager, so this is not a place I will be returning to.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anybody if feeling valued as a customer is important to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill an alright place to go have a few. Used to be a lot more happening of a spot. Dave behind the bar is awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for tasty great food, this is the place!  If you are looking for FANCY it is not for you. Signs of wear in the seating area, but nothing but tasty on the menu. Corned beef sliders yummy, and the wings may be the best in town. Everything is priced just right. The servers  (we had Amanda) are attentive, and personable and the drinks are great. So if you are looking for down to earth great   Home cooking with an Irish flair, you just found it.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in for a quick couple of beers after work.  Michelle the waitress was fun and had a great attitude. Been a while since I've been there for a rowdy time. I should return on a weekend and relive some of those moments.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways a good time at the Dubliner. We used to come here almost every Saturday night and while it is difficult to get a sitting or standing table, there is a lot of room to stand around, hehe. We usually end up playing darts or something. The staff is always polite and you can tell they like working there. That's always good. The beef stew is awesome. Bring on the fried pickles! The round ones are better, but they started doing spears, so hope that changes. Overall such a fun place!\n\n\n\n\n\nDropped in recently to grab a pint and try their bar food. I have to say that their wings were great. The bartender made me feel like I was a regular patron. The place was packed but the regulars made room at the bar for me to sit and engaged me in conversation. I felt really welcomed. It's a great pub.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo words....ULSTER FRY!!!!\n\nPerfect for that \"Hangover\" or the morning after.. where you are moving alittle slow... add a Bloody Mary to take off the edge and you are ready to go!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been a while since I went here, but I remember going a while back and seeing some live Irish music and having a good time.  I'll have to come back and check it out again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most unfriendly, bigoted, assh*les patrons I have ever been around in years. The servers were fine, but if you want to feel like you're in the south back in the 1800s, this is your place. F*ck this place. Hope it burns to the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have gone to this place two times now and have never had such bad service in any establishment. Worst place to come to and the music venue really sucks and doesn't match atmosphere. You are better off going to a chain restaurant than here. And on top of bad service, the food sucks.\n\n\n\n\n\nShepards pie and taco Tuesday are definitely just a couple of various reasons to visit the dubliner. Live music on most days and for the most part, most of the individuals are friendly and have manners.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I have been looking for a local bar that has a great atmosphere and people more our age.  We stopped in for a drink last night on our way home, and was nicely surprised by the friendly staff, cleanliness of the bar, and bathroom.  Lots of bar space, tables, and darts...our favorite.  We will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFANTASTIC, moist, tender corned beef year round! Honestly, this is a great bar with live music and a cheap enough bar tab, but the quality of the food exceeds expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk!  Lived in the area for 15+ years AND keep giving this place a chance, against my better judgement!  I really would like to make this my regular hang out since I'm a couple blocks away.  NOT going to happen.  Service is slow.  Bar staff is not very friendly.  More like a bother,  than a paying customer funding your bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayed trivia at the Dubliner last night.  Trivia was definitely the highlight.  Service was slow, semi-friendly, sporadic, and frustrating.  This may have been because it seemed there were only 2 servers. The beer was cold and chap- great combo when it comes to beer.  The boneless wings were decent, the carrots and celery were sub par (pretty hard to mess up those veggies), but the blue cheese was great- lots of blue cheese chunks.  The Shepards pie was hot and looked good, but was just average- adding Tabasco helped.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a pub so it's a good place for a cheap pint and a shot and maybe to throw some darts but that's about it. People make a bar great but the regulars here don't.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife had the chicken boxty and I had the Shepard's pie. Both were wonderful and we would come back again for sure.  Service was good but I could see it slowing as they got busier. We will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nTruly kicking myself in the arse as I've been near this place for over a decade and just in the past year decided to stick my head in, the location/exterior just kept me away...    Food has been excellent.  Service has been great in my experience.  I believe I have ordered the daily special (either for lunch or dinner) that they advertise on a chalk board outside the door in every visit.  They make the best Chips!  The bar is cool the way it wraps around and divides the place into 2 distinct areas - they have darts, a couple decent TV's for the games, a small stage for live entertainment.  I just think the place is cool and I'm comfortable when I'm there - the food hooked me.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dubliner is close to my house and pours a damn good Guinness.  Food is mediocre at best.  You might wait awhile for your drinks, but it does take time to pour a good pint.  I do have to run screaming from the building when they have Irish music nights.  As much as I love my people,  that high pitched little Irish flute thing they play makes me wonder if there are dogs all over the neighborhood being terribly disturbed.  Great neighborhood bar, food meh.  You can't really go wrong with an order of potato skins when you're drunk though....so there's that.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing bartenders and waitresses.  Great food.  Plenty of football.  Awesome prices,  Chill atmosphere.  Best cheese fries in the neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe just moved to town and were looking for a place exactly like this.  This bar is not posh, it is not shiny or pretty, it doesn't have a huge menu... and that is all fine by me.  \n\nWhat it does have is a friendly wait staff, plenty of seating, good/ok live music, and a great bar selection.  \n\nThe mix of people that was there the night we stopped in was entertaining... I can't really comment on that, as I still think everyone here in Phoenix is crazy... lol.  \n\nEither way, it seems to have that good old suburban bar feel to it, which is nice and cozy when you don't feel like dolling yourself up and having a fancy night out.\n\n\n\n\n\nHands down the greatest bartenders in town. Dave, Eric, and Chris are salt of the earth. The owners, Pat and John are great fellas as well and always greet me warmly. The place has always felt like my second home and family. Hell, I met my wife there and many fine friends besides.  I always have a great evening any time I can make it out. Food and entertainment always satisfy. The crowd there is generally cool and low key, and I always find good conversation with random folks on nights I roll solo.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never seen better service than what I was introduced with tonight. Busy, but my glass was never half full. Everyone so attentive. Kayla, Chris, and Krista the star of the show oh my goodness, were great in every aspect of the hospitality industry. Definitely making frequent visits!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dubliner helped me celebrate my Birthday and I don't think I will ever forget it!  It was my 2nd stop that night and it was a blast--but I have to give that credit to my friend  I have only been there a couple of times but I do remember part of my birthday and know that I spent some time sharing my experience with the first stall of the Ladies restroom.  I also recall the waitress chasing me down in the parking lot to pay!?!?  I have eaten lunch there a couple of times as well but I don't have much of anything good to say about that!  I may have to give it another chance to prove itself!  We'll see!\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy hour prices are good - get a domestic beer for $2-3. The staff seems friendly and the sweet potato fries are yummy. Didn't stay too long so that's all I can report for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a bad experience here a couple months ago with a bartender. We told the owner about her, and I haven't seen her around there since. Went back last night to see authority zero play and I had a great time! The bar was literally PACKED. Wall to wall. Found a small spot at the bar and was served my drinks super quick! Glad to see that things are getting better here.\n\n\n\n\n\nI used to work here and the staff and locals are like family. If u are down to earth ~ I'm sure you'll love the dub! No pretentiousness here! There's good entertainment almost every night of the week. The band that plays Tuesday nights is the BEST! Weekend nights are pretty busy and crowed, but the drinks are priced right and the food is really good too! My faves are the ckn boxty, the Reuben & the Philly ~ but basically everything the menu is DELISH! If u wanna have some real Irish fun, visit the Dub!! It's the place to be on St. Patricks Day for sure!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place when it's good. Horrid place otherwise. No pool, bad music. Used to love this place. Will never go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I just had the worst waitress I've ever had. I guess it's a milestone. She took a while to get to our table, no big deal. Told us they were out of the beer my boyfriend ordered, then remembered maybe they weren't. Brought me a dish that wasn't what I ordered. After my bf finished his meal I was brought salmon so overcooked it was hard, 'lemon caper sauce' that tasted like flour mixed in water, and boxed mashed potatoes. The mixed veggies were OK. My boyfriend ordered a refill on his all-you-can eat fish fry and another beer. She forgot it all and came back a while later to ask if he wanted more (!?). I tasted the fish fry. Flavorless cod, just like they rolled it in plain flour, with pre-packaged French fries. I'll never understand why a restaurant can't cut and fry a potato. The fish refill came without the sauce for which he'd asked. The waitress did offer a free Guinness, but I had to pay full price for the salmon dinner I didn't eat and complained about.  At least I was entertained by the band butchering some cover tunes. Doesn't make me want to rush to the Green Isle anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse to be awesome...male bartenders that change your juke box entries is bs.. Our server Crystal was awesome..food was okay minus the old grease. I use to come here all the time but stopped because of the smell and bad service from male bartenders. Miss the beautiful women that use to take care of us. Pretty sad being Irish and these young fockers mess it up. No wonder people complain about it. Unbelievable! Just because Chris doesn't like certain music doesn't give him the right to cancel customers music. Stay away! Bullshit!\n\n\n\n\n\nJess rocks as a server and The Sullivan's kick butt! What a great band! Love their Irish music. But they can play anything!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had to remind my server we ordered food. Never came out. Enough said. When the check came out I asked if our food was forgotten about. I was told..... \"Next time just give me a poke\" really?\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here 4 times and I get the same thing every time.  The Shepards Pie is outstanding.  I always want to try something different, but I know that I will be disappointed that I didn't have my regular. The waitresses here have always been friendly and I will be back soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish beef stew, shepherd pie, sausage rolls, and the bread pudding were all excellent and worth the price. Everyone in the group was very happy with their selection. It was lunchtime on NYE - there were plenty of people there to put up decorations for this evening, but they only had one person there working as a server (not sure how many were working the kitchen). It took quite a while for us to get our food, and even then, only two of the four of us got food at first, and then it took a while for the other two to receive their food. A drink that was ordered early on in the meal wasn't brought out until after the check had been paid. I believe our server was doing the best she could with the other tables she had but it is unfortunate that they weren't properly staffed to make it a 5 star experience for our first time dining at The Dubliner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've expanded this place a bit since I was here last and it definitely moved it from a 2 1/2 to a solid 3 1/2 to 4 star kind of place.  In a strip mall (gee, who's surprised) in a North Phoenix suburb (Ok, now you can be surprised!), you wouldn't expect this place to be as cool as it is.  Food served all day, and everything we've tried is pretty good (Great looking fries!).  As great as it is to get Irish pub food all day long, it is great to watch the place transform from a sleepy lunch spot to a packed standing room only spot around the time the entertainment gets going at 9pm.  It's generally traditional Irish music, but the night we were there he also did a 50's song and we swear he was playing music from the Godfather as we moved on to our next destination.  \n\nLots of tables for big parties - which ours was (though the largest that night must have had 24 or more) and a great big wrap around the back bar.  The bar is one of their improvements - looks like they took over some extra space to expand since I'd been there years ago.  Several of us commented on how much bigger it looked and how much nicer it felt.  For some the downside is that this isn't a fancy \"Scottsdale\" bar, but on the upside - this is NOT some fancy schmancy \"Scottsdale\" bar.  You'll have folks of ALL ages there based on when you go.  And all shapes and sizes.  I kinda like that - you know, people looking like people.  Over the years we've been there, everyone seems to get along, just like the neighborhood pub it was meant to be.\n\nOh yea.  They have Guinness.  And Harp.  And Bass.  Beer and more beer.  That's not my thing so I can't really speak to it, but it is there in abundance.  Someone else will just have to stop by, have a pint and tell us all about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here the other night for a couple drinks, probably one of my favorite bars i've ever been to. Great irish pub atmosphere and music\n\n\n\n\n\nService was terrible. We ordered beers and food. Food never came out after about an hour after she said it will be out soon. She waited about 30 min to even show her face around our table for another beer. She was very busy flirting with a group of about 8 guys grabbing and touching them. When we mentioned our food she said \"I'm so sorry, remind me what you ordered. Next time you have to let us know\" Why do I have to remind you?? It was not even busy. Stop flirting with every guy you see and do your job!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for a late night dinner to see The Sea Merchants perform. Had never been here before and were amazed at how packed the place was! Service was cheerful and probably could have used a little more help - not sure they were expecting the crowd they got last night, but we were enjoying the music and not too concerned with how fast service was. Had the Guinness Chicken, sweet potato fries, the Irish soda bread and washed it all down with a couple of brews. All pretty good. I'd recommend the place for a good time with friends. Relaxed, casual and fun! And the Sea Merchants performance was a rockin' good time!\n\n\n\n\n\nCame in, thought nice bar. First bartender was nice, came to table and was attentive. Second bartender came in, have not seen him. Have to walk around to dinning area to order my drinks. Then he just drops them off at end of bar for me to go get them. Hmmm... not the service I was expecting\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food great authentic Irish fare and best of all close to home\n\n\n\n\n\nWent in for the first time, new to the neighborhood. I was excited to try an authentic Irish Pub at last but unfortunately when I walked in my hopes were dashed. Interior was kind of drabby and there was no host/hostess at the door. I came in and wandered about a bit and eventually sat myself down at a table. Wait staff seemed to be unaware I was there so I eventually got up and went to the bar myself to get a drink. Didn't bother with the food and just paid and left.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place actually has pretty good bar food. I haven't had anything yet that wasn't good. The only problem is all the reviews that say the service stinks are absolutely true.\n\nIf the servers aren't outside smoking they are texting on their phones or standing around chatting among themselves and ignoring the customers. My advise would be to go there but go in with the opinion you need to be a jerk to the server and demand the service you are paying for. Skip the tip and keep doing it until they get it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty sad! Hoping for cool neighborhood bar- didn't happen here at all!!!! Racist! Rude.  Unknowledgeable..  actually a very low iq here!! good luck!  Played a total game w me on the Jukebox! Don't even go!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo bar anywhere in this area comes as close to pulling everything off like the \"Dub\".  Beer Selection, Darts, TVS, lots of seating, events, great prices and a great mix of people.  The staff is always great, and ready to serve at all times.  Come here open minded, stay for a bit, watch the crowd pour in.  Always a good time.\n\n\n\n\n\nlove the dubliner, nice local hangout. Last night we went to listen to open mic. The people who organize it are inconsiderate and rude. They were over 30 minutes late in starting. A friend of theirs, Dominick,  singing with an accompanist on the bass. Once they were done they sat at the bar with the organizers. Dominick even borrowed a man's guitar. Done of them  had to manners to sit in the area and  watch the players after them.  Extremely rude in my book. I will not go back to listen to the Open Mic at the  Dubliner.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't drink much, so I'm not dazzled by what is on tap. We came here to try a local Irish pub and see how their food was.\n\nOne star is too good for this place. I had the \"bangers and mash\". The quotes are necessary, trust me. My wife had -- we think -- the Shepherd's Pie. If the waitress had been attentive, we'd have asked. Since we weren't guzzling fermented piss, I guess we didn't rate on her radar. At least it wasn't terribly expensive.\n\nI doubt we'll go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nYikes! This one hurts me, because based on my experience onsite with the girl attendants, and the manager- it seemed, and my take out order, ambiance, and all that I was 100% sure it would be a top review. But I would like to just be sincere and say, the food was not there at all. No, not at all. And that was dissappointing. It was tasteless.... One of my pet peeves.  Their fish and chips are made of quality fish. It did feel fresh. But totally tasteless. The coleslaw has no forgiveness though. It was just lettuce with mayo. I still give it a high 3 stars because this is one of those staples in the neighbourhood worth of giving it a try. Even if once, for their ambiance, and great selection of drinks. No better place to have a Guinesss I bet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis my favorite pub in Phoenix! Good beer selections. Good food (the shepard's pie is amaze-balls, the Irish nachos are epic, and the frickles are delish). They have good live music / entertainment during the evenings. This is a great place to go during the day to hang out with friends, watch a game, have a quiet beer, or have an awesome night out partying. The weekend nights are a raging blast! The staff does a great job handling it all!\n\n\n\n\n\nHit or miss. Went in for drinks one Friday night, found 2 spots open at the bar, had great service, proper Guinness, and then enjoyed some fried pickles. The live music was great and the vibe was fun and vibrant  \n\nWent in two weeks later with intent of eating dinner, found two seats at the bar, were ignored for nearly 7 minutes (the 7 minutes before happy hour ended) while the server seemed to pretend to count her drawer, then  had to ask if we could get an order in before happy hour ended. With a sigh, she said yes, we ordered two pints of Guinness, one Jameson and the fried pickles. 10 minutes later, we had nothing in front of us. I appreciate when a bar takes the proper time with guinness, but this was ridiculous. \n\nUsually the last few minutes before happy hour ends, the bartenders do a great job of making the rounds to make sure everyone is taken care of. Not the case at The Dubliner this night. No staff to be found anywhere. Although I could see our two pints of Guinness sitting there on the other side of the bar. Finished. Ready.  Wanting to be delivered. And when I asked the only staff in sight, she said oh yeah they're going to grab them now, I saw someone grab them, move them about two inches to the right and set them back down. Then everyone vanished again for about 4-5 more minutes. \n\nIt wasn't just is, it was everyone at the bar who was sharing the feeling of being ignored. \n\nFinally, someone grabbed the pints and delivered then with the Jameson and dropped the fried pickles off soon after. Just in time, too, as we were just about to walk. \n\nWish we had. The pickles were NOTHING like our previous visit, they were barely cooked and swimming in a pool of oil. Inedible. We mentioned it to the bartender, who didn't offer any apologies, all she said was that you never know what you're gonna get, it depends on who is working the fryer that night. Wow. \n\nWith that, we gulped our drinks, paid the tab, and left. They clearly didn't want our business that night. \n\nUsually when I have a 50/50 experience somewhere, I'll go back for a tie breaker, but it may be a while before we make it back around to The Dubliner for the deciding vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur go-to dive bar!\nFor a cold beer, string cocktail and/or trued and true pub food, this is the place.  Big place so usually a place to sit (we go in late afternoon since we're beyond the party age).\nAlso have darts and video games.\nGood ol Dubliner!\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing against my 100 reviews or less policy, Dubliner currently has 128.  But I wanted to compare one of my favorite bars in the Phoenix area to one that is close to where I live now.  This is part of my legacy series of past memories.\n\nI first came to the Dubliner on Sunday, October 1, 2006.  At the time I was doing pizza delivery, and it was a little slow that night, and I was reading the Phoenix New Times magazine.  It mentioned that they have an open mic at the Dubliner.  I told my friend about it, and she was not in the mood to go (she was having feminine issues that night she told me weeks later), but I convinced her to go.  She probably said I'll go to check out, but I don't want to stay too long, which I agreed.  I picked her up.  She lived 4 miles from Dubliner, and we drove to what was at the time an unfamiliar bar.  The bar was established in 1985, but I was far too young to drink back in their early days; I could barely walk or talk!\n\nWhen we arrived, we realized this was a large place with a huge bar area (which makes a U-shape around the middle of the place), booths, tables, dart boards, and pool tables.  We sat in a booth near the Open Mic area, and we were impressed with the various musicians.  We each had a beer.  I think I might've had a Smithwicks as that was & still is a common beer choice, and unfortunately, I don't like Guinness.  The server was friendly.  The person hosting Open Mic was super talented, and we even talked to her that night, and she was warm & engaging; too bad she was engaged!\n\nGuess what happened the following Sunday?  My friend wanted to go back to Dubliner, and we enjoyed the Open Mic all over again on October 8th.  We went many of the Sundays in October & November 2006, and we continued to go less frequently after that.\n\nThey still do the Open Mic on Sundays today (I checked their website).  Additionally, we went on a couple of Tuesday nights, where the singer [The one who hosts the open mic] & band perform (She is still performing there 12 years later!).\n\nDuring on Sunday & occasional Tuesdays, we met a lot of great people.  The servers & bartenders were all nice & got the drinks out quickly.  One of the random people we met there always got a Blue Moon beer.  A nice guy, but we jokingly made fun of him behind his back about always getting Blue Moon.  Guess what?  Today, that is one of my favorite beers.  If it hadn't been for the Dubliner, I might not have realized the joys of a cold Blue Moon.\n\nWe went on St. Patrick's Day 2007, which was a Saturday.  It was during a massive heat wave.  The high that day & before was a blazing hot 99 F, a record high temperature that will be very difficult to beat.  \n\nSt. Patrick's Day, of course, was a completely different experience.  It was crowded, but still a good time with several friends.  I remember one of the beers I had was green, but that's about all I remember from that infamous night...haha.\n\nI moved away to the DC area in 2011, but we went a couple of times since then when I visited at Christmastime.  Nothing has really changed there (which is good).  I hope that Dubliner stays in business for a very long time because it's my favorite in the Phoenix area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun place and cool staff! Good prices on beers! This is the best place in all of Phoenix to go to for St Pats day!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food.  Plenty of football.  Awesome prices,  Chill atmosphere.  Best cheese fries in the neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was here yesterday and had great service. Tonight I walked in and was ignored by the stupid blond working the bar.

I waited 25 minutes for a bowl of chili? Really? Did they have to hunt a cow? I mean you scoop it in a bowl and you serve it. It should only take 5 minutes but 25 minutes???? I walked out. Oh and by the way I told my waitress I've been waiting for 25 minutes---- she said ok. No apologies. Wow! Avoid it like a plague.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was there around 6am on the Sunday before Thanksgiving. It was quiet and my server was a delightfully friendly guy. The food came out hot and super fast since they were fairly empty. The server, whose name I have forgotten, even filled up my water bottle and packed me a complimentary to-go cup of coffee. I think the prices are reasonable for freshly made food; just watch out for those drink peicee\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food and service,  especially considering the location. Best airport food I've had.  Reuben was sloppy and delicious.  Cobb salad had a Mediterranean twist... Kalamata olives and balsamic vinaigrette. Yum!\n\n\n\n\n\nSat down. Ordered a cheese omelette. People sat down next to me (2 different parties) and ordered, got their food and ate it before I got mine. One of those parties even cashed out and left before I got mine.\n\nI asked the waiter what happened and he said the chefs get food tunnel-vision and miss orders. I had to take my order to go and bring it on the plane. Super stressful to hope it was going to show up before my plane started boarding. Took over 30mins to get a cheese omelette.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious food great quick service of locally and organically sourced ingredients...\n\n\nThey get me, i want amazing food fast at the airport!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have two hours between flights I guess this could work.  Worst service I have ever had in an airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot my cup of tea. Very sweet Rosemary potatoes, prefer garlic and green peppers. Salami scramble, unempressive. Rubbery salami and tasteless eggs. Cold coffee.\n\nHealthy food? I would loose weight by eating a lot less, if this was my only choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood service. Good pancakes and the home fries / rosemary potatoes are great. \n\nGot us seated and food came out fast. \n\nOne warning: the children's options are HUGE. Share with kids and save the waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's, not just for breakfast! 10 of us gals, (yes 10) rolled into Matt's for one last drink (after draining Costco's wine section for 5 days straight) and a bite to eat before boarding our flight home. While this is one of the nicest Airport restaurants I've eaten in, and the food (when it finally arrived) was quite good, there were just way too many snafus for me to give them more then 3 stars. \n\nTo start, 3 of us got there before the others - thank you priority check-in! So we ordered a good 15 minutes before the rest of the group. Needless to say, after 45mins, watching the rest of the group get their meals, and finish, we still had not got our meals. Everyone shared, so I can tell you the Cobb salad, super good as are the fries. Now after trying to ask our waitress, a few times, to find out what happened to our meals, she kept saying the kitchen was busy and it will come when it comes... We all knew this was not right, no matter how busy a kitchen is, food ordered first, comes first if it is the same item. Well after 45 minutes of ignoring our concerns, finally she let us know that the food runner had brought our 3 meals to another table over half an hour ago. Right.... So now we need to board a flight, they quickly make us our meals, it comes out under cooked, we have a few bites before running to board, we get the bill and the 3 of us have our meals 10% compt. 10 freaking percent?!!! You have got to be kidding me Matt's! That is so unacceptable for a 45 minute wait, major screw up and then undercooked food that comes out and the 3 of us ate less then a quarter of. Not impressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat quality breakfast food with awesome drink selection. Friendly staff, wide menu selection and fast service. I almost forgot I was in a airport, one of the best restaurants in sky harbor. Full size bar, to-go ordering and open late with breakfast served all day! I have hard time seeing how anyone wouldn't like this place! It is a little pricey but not bad at all for being in a airport. This place is now a regular stop for me when I'm flying out of sky harbor!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hours posted here are incorrect, they were open at 9pm when I got to the airport.\n\nI just had one of the best breakfast burritos of my life here! Asked for well done bacon and it was perfectly cooked and so thick, jalapeos were a great addition too! The man working at the counter was super friendly and the prices are very reasonable for such delicious airport food!\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Bloody Mary,but  not the best tasting .I Will say I am a bit of a Bloody Mary snob I love the ones that you don't want to smile after you take a drink because your teeth will be full of stuff packed full of spices and goodies ... with that being said the salt around the rim was amazing nice smoky spicy flavor. The cheese was a new twist and it worked good it was a nice cheese. the olives were subpar as was the cucumber.( one cucumber looked old or once frozen and the other one was sooooo very salty and I love salt but couldn't eat this one.. AND IT COSTS  $15.00 EACH..\n\n\n\n\n\nWe actually preferred eating here b/f our flight to kick off our vacation!  The original downtown one wasn't near as positive an experience as this one turned out to be!  Service was the best, food was excellent and even though everyone is there waiting for a plane-we weren't rushed and they made us feel valued!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot sure what's going on in the kitchen, but it shouldn't take over an hour to make \"scratch Belgian waffles\". Then I spectate other people wait in line, ordered their food, eat their food, and walk off while I'm still waiting for my order to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nI hit a lot of airports in a year and this is by far the best breakfast available. Most airport food is like hospital food. Frozen, bland and warmed over. This morning I ordered hog & chick with a side of patty sausage. Everything is hot, fresh and made to order. Eggs over easy, thick bacon, sausage patty, country potatoes and wheat toast.  Oh, the service? Fast and friendly and they make sure everything is good. Most important, they kept my coffee hot! I'll definitely come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain guys I dodge a line here! So be prepared to wait if you go after 8. Anyways it was 7am and there I was drinking a mimosa, the airport has weird rules and no judge zone am I right?\n\nTheir mimosa was pretty standard but it was actually fresh squeezed oranges which is a plus. But you know it's a mimosa so eh. \n\nI had French toast and smoke sausage which the toast was amazing. The sausage however was so salty it wasn't even edible. So I left it. \n\nThe biggest flaw was that buzz me if you need a waitress button. It made the whole thing uncomfortable. At one point I wanted another mimosa but it didn't feel right to hit the button to buzz her over. That's just weird. I get their trying to under staff and save on waitresses but it's a weird encounter. The waitress was nice though with good recommendations but still. \n\nIf their is no line go if there is an obnoxious line skip it.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me start by saying I have been to the original Matt's location. I love the original Matt's location. So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this one on a long layover in Phoenix. I was a little skeptical when I got closer. The walls are subway tile and there is a lot of orange and chrome, making it feel more like a diner than the funky downtown Matt's. Not only do they have breakfast all day, but they have a Ruben. A crazy good Ruben. Upgrade to the steak fries, you'll be glad you did!  The rye bread was buttery and toasty.  The corned beef was flavorful and tender. To top it off, my server Miguel was awesome. I travel for work, so I eat alone a lot. He was attentive without being intrusive. When you dine alone you tend to notice when service is slow or around too much. Miguel really had a knack for being there at the right time. Thanks for the great dinner. I will now have to schedule my trips with a long layover in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will go 3 stars instead of 2 because it is in an airport. I sat down and was greeted by an unhappy, unhelpful bartender. I ordered food right away. After 25 minutes I asked her very politely to check on my food, as I had a plane to catch. She snapped back that the kitchen got busy. I told her I was not upset, I just had to get going. She went on to snap back that everything is made fresh so it takes time. I got a medium rare burger. Shouldn't take 25 minutes in an airport. When I did get my burger it was less than mediocre. I love burgers, it is hard for me to be unhappy with one, especially when it is supposedly cooled in butter. Meh. \nI normally fly out of concourse A, I wss really excited to be in B to try this place. Next time, I will take a walk to another concourse. I won't be back here.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's unbelievable slow, which can be understood, given it's an airport.  People sit down to eat either waiting on their flight to take off, or their connection flight.   The food being slow is for sure an inconvenience.  But given that these things happen, you would expect them to treat you with respect and be empathetic of travelers time.   \n\nBut they have no patience with their customers.  I witnessed a waitress yell at a patron,  tell him if he had a problem, he could yelp about it.    He didn't.  But I did.   \n\n32 minutes for a grilled cheese and tomato soup.  \n\nThe soup never came and I missed my connection.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped here in Arizona for an airport layover and we had around 1 hour to spare.  We were in and out in 30 minutes.  Depending on whom you get you can order lunch and dinner.  If you get the muscular bald headed guy with lots of energy he will make it happen.  I ordered the pork and eggs and made a sandwich out of it.  The blt is goof as they use the fat bacon.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible. Really only wanted a bite and cocktail waiting on delayed flight. How hard is NO Butter on toast? Sent it back 3x and it was never returned correctly. This was a side no less. One scrambled egg and dry rye fiasco. If that wasn't enough, she swooped my drink away with 2 sips left.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast is quite an institution in Phoenix, absolutely the place to go for breakfast. It's great to see the same quality, efficiency and competent wait staff replicated at the airport here. The three point breakfast made for a great lunch, waitress Toni was attentive and helpful, service was quick and the food very solid, not fancy, but tasty and nourishing. Fresh avocados rounded out a two eggs with meat sandwich and rosemary tomatoes. Airport food in general has come such a long way, but Matt's stands out.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, 1:00PM.\n\nCaught them dealing with a rush. For those ordering pickup, there was a slow moving line. For those dining in, there were delayed orders. Poor customer rep at the register did her best to handle the wave. \n\nQuickie:\n+Clean\n+Menu variety\n\nAnd then...?\nActual sandwich was decent. Delay in getting food (+15 min) because of understaffing. Willing to give MBB another go. \n\n**********\nStuffed my face in:\n1. Classic Reuben\n     +Sauce complemented corned beef into savory bursts\n     -Chips were stale\n     -Pickle lacked crunch\n\nConstructive comments:\n*Compost and clear recycling bins\n*Sustainable cutlery\n*Streamline system to handle patrons who are dining in and taking out\n\n\n\n\n\nI've always had a great experience with the location on Phoenix, but I have not enjoyed my visit to this location once. The first time I got a breakfast burrito, and while it was good, there were so many jalapeos on it I almost got sick. The second time I ordered a burrito with no jalapeos, but they were still included on my burrito. The service at the to go counter isn't great, if you're going to eat here take the time to sit down for a meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nService very slow ... took 10 minutes to get someone attention at take out counter ... chicken sandwich dried out ... should have gone to Wendy's\nNot you typical Matts\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here for breakfast with friends and family. Great small caf atmosphere and Decore parking is tight because they are doing road work around the restaurant. Great lunch and breakfast menu we came here for brunch and were delighted. Pancakes, omelettes, salads were delicious service was great we will be back\n\n\n\n\n\nExtremely slow service for a airport restaurant. Sat down and told them we had a flight in an hour and they said no problem. 50 minutes later we had to ask for our food to go and ran for the plane. Did not eat until we were on the plane. Very disappointing!\n\n\n\n\n\nFood fair @ best. Got the BLT which was on dry toast & over done bacon- Cole slaw was an upgrade dont bother! Dry cabbage is what you get- Tomato soup is pretty good tho it takes an act of Congress to get some oyster crackers to go with it.\nCustomer Service sucks! Had to go up to the bar to get a soda refill not once but twice & to ask for crackers- Waiter no where around- this is the 2nd time we tried this place with the same terrible customer service- don't waste your time- there are plenty of other good places in the terminal to get a good meal with good customer service!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was great and the smothered an covered was great the blood Mary just just ok .\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not miss the chance to enjoy this local favorite! I was so excited to learn that Matt's  Big Breakfast opened a spot in the airport. A real treat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIve always wanted to try Matt's BB at the airport..... Even though this is the only Matts that serves alcohol, it  doesn't compare. Stay with the original location, even the food portion was different.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo greeters! No hostess! Full place and looks like one server for 100 people and 2 bartenders!! Had to seat ourselves at a dirty table and waited for any kind of attention for 5 minutes and then took off!! Nice job Manager!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a healthy hearty salad order the  healthy salad with grilled chicken. Outstanding quality. Great service. Our server had a very short haircut with pretty eyes. I did not get her name but she was so kind.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowest service I've ever gotten. I think they forget people have to get on flights. Be carful when you eat here you might miss your flight.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest airport breakfast EVER! One of the best breakfast joints ever. Potatoes well seasoned with fresh rosemary. Bacon is thick and meaty and also peppered nicely. Food has really good flavor. We got double charged for coffee because we got it at the to-go side & then decided to sit, but it was an understandable oversight. Other than that service friendly and attentive. Love that they have ketchup without high fructose corn syrup & pure honey.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family and I ate here while waiting to board our very delayed flight back home to LA. Initially, it was very crowded and we were told it would be half an hour wait. In their defense, we were flying on 4th of July most of the other restaurants in the airport were closed. But we ended up getting seated within 10 mins. \nMy only complaint would be that it was a pretty long wait to get our food but when we got it, it was great!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst service EVER!! The cashier Stephanie at the to-go spot was terrible and super rude! I get you are busy but rolling your eyes at someone is completely uncalled for!\n\n\n\n\n\nJust walk by...food was cold, although our server was very nice she forgot to bring toast and hostess was rude. Giving the place 1 star is a stretch\n\n\n\n\n\nWell I say they're doing a great job transformation is amazing the food is exactly the same except there's less of a wait :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nHave always wanted to hit this place in Phoenix.... wait, now they are in the Terminal at Sky Harbor Airport... baaam hellllooo layover.\n\nFood was solid, had a name your omelet with sausage, veggies and some queso.  Potatoes had incredibly flavor with the seasonings and little extra they throw in there.\n\nService was great, my coffee cup was always full.  Definitely the right spot when stuck in Sky Harbor which seems to be EVERY time lately while they work on the runway.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you've been traveling since 3 am, you just want to stop for a big breakfast and coffee. Luckily, my gate was a mere 30 second walk from Matt's, giving me plenty of time to enjoy a \"Matt's big breakfast\" with pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage. The bacon here is peppered, thick, and delicious. The rest of the breakfast measured up just as well. They also have a full bar in case you aren't traveling at breakfast time and have other menu items as well. Overall, I'm pleased that this was an option in my terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the way they converted Matt's to an airport concept. Much more successful than the attempt made by Lolo's Chicken & Waffles. For those of you just passing through Sky Harbor, these are both Phoenix institutions worthy of a try.\n\nI think Matt's effort here is more successful simply because they have their own dining space to manipulate, not a shared space. They use it well. Some tables. Lots of counter space for single travelers. Some communal seating. Lots of outlets. Great breakfast food early in the day and a full bar for later. Or breakfast food later in my case. A lunch menu is available as well. And it's all priced pretty reasonably for an airport. Well done.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge your phone, drink your beer, and have an epic burrito.. What more could you really want? We didn't get them but the server told us how amazing the waffles are, definitely on our list for the next time we come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo visits a row = very disappointing\n\nTwice now the eggs over medium are runny - I guess when you ask for the whites to be cooked through it doesn't matter; toast not toasted?? What's up Matt??\n\nI don't want you to \"take care of my breakfast\" I simply want to enjoy a good breakfast before my flight, and I'm happy to take care of the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast is now my favorite airport breakfast spot! The friendliest staff, fast service and good food! Throw in the crispy bacon for the win! Add Tabasco instead of Tapatio, and you're a 5 star winner!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst service I've ever had. Matt was there and he didn't even talk to people, he seems like he doesn't care. I am all for supporting local businesses because they show they care but he didn't. Food is overrated, I heard it was the best but it's comparable to Denny's.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk you are in a hurry so you don't have time to sit down and eat. But hey there is a takeaway section yay!  But wait if you think it is faster be warned the woman working at this counter is super slow. No urgency at all and complaining about how busy it is. Coffee that is mad goes to the waitresses slowing things down further.  I love Matt's big breakfast and if you do too. Get to the airport early and skip the takeaway. A\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the better airport food places I've been to.  Thick slices of bacon that you almost need two hands to eat, (exaggeration) and they were delicious.  I also had sausage, 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes and a large pancake for $13.  Liked every bit of my breakfast and can't wait to come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been looking forward to trying Matt's for a while, and finally had an excuse to grab a Sonrisa Burrito on a quick layover in Phoenix.\n\nOh well.\n\nService was somewhat slow - it was after 8pm and one person was working the register and running orders, as far as I could tell, so she would disappear for a few minutes at a time.\n\nThe burrito? Big soft flour tortilla. I got sausage, and the sausage was okay, nothing special. The eggs were dry and scant, and the potatoes needed to be in smaller chunks. Flavor was just missing, and the salsa was unimpressive. Overall, I'm glad I tried it, because now I know not to bother. It's probably better if you get a plate with bacon or something baked, judging by the crowds - I just hope that the disappointing burrito was not representative as I like their farm-to-table concept.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday late afternoon...50% full tables...fast service...tasty Reuben...nice waiter. Will come again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI could tell the beef was good quality but they could've still added just a little salt and pepper.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy fianc and I stopped into here because there wasn't much to choose from at the Phoenix airport. We arrived around 7:30-8am and it was packed. We were seated fairly quickly though. \n\nWe were originally seated at the one of the tall tables and after sitting on a plane for over 5 hours, those chairs are so uncomfortable. A booth became available and we asked to be seated there and they let us. So I was thankful for that. \n\nThe food was pretty good. Just your regular breakfast options. We ordered Matt's big breakfast with an extra egg and toast to split. It comes with sausage, bacon, two eggs, home fries and a pancake. I enjoyed everything except the sausage, but my fianc liked it all. Home fries were flavored very well. Eggs were cooked perfectly. I also ordered a side of Mac Salad, which isn't normally available until 11:30, but they had it ready so they let me.\n\nFor the amount of people that were there and only 3 guys cooking, the food and time that it came out in was impressive. Our server was very friendly and she was very accommodating. We had a good experience here.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent service here. Large portions- great value. Strawberry compote served with the toast is great - and different.  Unexpected pleasure for breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nI never do one star reviews, I leave that to other  folks however I have to keep it on the realz. Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced not once but twice.\n\nHad to drop my kiddo off at the airport super duper early today. I always wait at the gate with her. I grabbed my usual coffee from the Refuge and they are always awesome! Decided to grab a sandwich to go from this place and walked up to the \"to go\" counter and the waitress who was prepping said and I quote \"I have to check to see if we are open\" and walked away. The gentlemen who was in line with me said they open @ 5:30 (it was 5:30) so they are open. There were 6 people working, bartender, host, cook, mgr and a couple other people. Why comeeeee the waitress never came back, no one acknowledged the growing line of folks waiting to order. I walked over to the bartender who was actually taking food orders for the folks who sat at the bar and politely asked if someone was going to take our orders and she said without one glance that the waitress will be over in a min. Mind you we had been standing there for 7 mins, every single person that worked there looked over at the ever growing to go line. I/we watched the waitress go get water for a table, coffee then slowly walk to get a coke! Reallyyyy folks... really! After almost 10 mins I was like let's bounce. As I walked by the waitress was taking the food order of the one table she had. Everyone else was sitting at the bar! Still not one person working there went over to the \"to go\" line. \n\nHow very very rude. This  place needs to get it the heck together and revisit their customer service etiquette. The shift manager was there too! Wow just wow.  \n\nDone and done....never again!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally happy to find this place the morning of my flight home from Phoenix.\n\nThe servers are super cool - fun & cheery which is just what a weary traveler needs.  The couple sitting next to me were totally cracking up at their server - I had a different server but he was fun and attentive as well.  \n\nI had the breakfast burrito (vegetarian) and it was delish!   Coffee and water were kept full and the burrito was sooo good.    I'd definitely recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, I'm giving five stars to an airport restaurant. Here's why. My husband and I stumbled into Matt's after being stuck overnight in Phoenix, having missed a connection on our way home to CA. Without makeup, in day 2 clothes, and jet-lagged out of my mind, I just wanted to use our meal vouchers on something. Anything.\n\nWhat we got was just wonderful. Fresh, delicious comfort food. I got a hearty breakfast sandwich with egg and bacon that came with a side of rosemary potatoes. My husband had a giant crispy waffle. My Bloody Mary came garnished with peppers, pickles, cheese cubes, celery, and a slice of bacon.\n\nBut what really pushed this review to 5 stars was our server, Michael. He greeted us with sincere warmth and good humor, and kept us laughing and smiling through our meal. Believe me, that was no easy feat based on my mood! He made great suggestions for food and drink, letting me sample the Bloody Mary mix from the drink I selected before ordering (I went with a different one based on his recommendation and I'm glad I did). And when our meal vouchers exceeded the tab, he used the extra to provide us with bottled water for our flight. Not sure when I'll be back in PHX, but I'll eat at Matt's for sure, and will hope for Michael as my server.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrendously slow!  It's an airport, if you're this slow, you're no good.  Worse yet, I'm just talking about the to go line!  To go, to them, gets no preference.  \n\nOn top of that, they give the wrong food.  Given their before mentioned slowness, after receiving my food, I had to get on the plane, only to then discover, instead of oatmeal, they gave me an egg, bacon and cheese sandwich with potatoes.  While I'm sure it was tasty (maybe), it most certainly is not in my eating habit.  So, there I am on a 3 hour morning flight with the choice of either going hungry or eating some crap that's going to make me feel sluggish and bad all day.  I chose hunger.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's at Terminal 4 in Sky Harbor.  What a great concept (adding a full bar).  The restaurant and bar, counters and tables are just beautiful.  Nice decor that reminds you of Matt's downtown.  However, the food here is just not the same.  Scrambled eggs were dry and seemed like they had been cooked for a buffet.  Potatoes not as good as the original.  Toast was superior (they must have stayed with the same baker).  I saw so much food being thrown away (folks just weren't enjoying their breakfast).  Overall, I was disappointed.  I'll give Matt's another try next time I travel and hope the quality returns.  Come on Matt, get it together and serve quality breakfasts like you are known for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service is always horrible. The 2 stars are for the food. There are restaurant with better service and food  in Sky Harbor if you don't have a lot of time pass this one by!\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing special about the oatmeal.  Service was decent but felt rushed- which is fine- I get it- we're at an airport....But then when I did want to leave I couldn't get my card run until I stood up to leave. But worst of all:  THE COFFEE WAS HORRIBLE!  Guys, this is a breakfast restraint and you can't make a half way decent cup of strong coffee?  I've had water that had more flavor!!\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably just a bad night for them, but I interacted with 3 employees and all were short and rude and Uninterested.  I had to ask for a menu, ask if I could order a beer, and when I asked if they have chips and salsa the bartender said \"no\" and walked away. Nuthin. Then couldn't get them to process my payment for 10 minutes. The exception was Karina, a waitress who was friendly. The only smile over a 25 minute period.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered an omelette & potatoes. The entire plate was swimming in grease. The meal was crazy greasy - not impressed. The service was as good as can be expected during the holiday rush travel hour. If this is my only choice in concourse B I'll opt for Wendy's next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nJen was a great server. Very attentive and friendly. The big butter burger hit the spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nI stopped here during a 4 hour layover and had the waffles and they were great.  I had cranberry juice and water and was well satisfied.  This was a pleasant experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came into the place starving and ready to devour our food. But the trouble had started with getting seated and having to fight with a father and a little girl for our seats because they thought they were sitting there even though they never got seated by anyone. After that we ordered and ended up waiting 20 minutes for our food. I ordered the 5 platter plate (breakfast sandwich), it was really good. My cousin ordered a omelet and loved it. My sister ordered the salami scramble and it wasn't good, I could make better eggs. My brother ordered the big breakfast and ate it fast.The only thing that we hated was the potatoes. The potatoes in general were fine but they were sauted in rosemary or something foul and were just nasty. The food was decently priced and you get what you pay for. Wouldn't recommend for a quick meal. Nothing special.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood place, real friendly... Good food and drink. Not sure how these folks hold down an airport restaurant though. 10+ min to find a waitress or bartender to order, 10+ min to find someone to pay. If you're in a hurry (as ppl at the airport generally are), consider another option.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo as I strolled through the Phoenix Airport I moved passed the regular fast food breakfast fare and came across Matt's Big Breakfast and thought \"this is the place.\"  The tables were packed and the \"to go\" line seemed to be moving quickly.  I checked my phone (25-30 minutes to boarding STARTED), read over the menu (Breakfast Burrito for the win) and got in line.  \n\nThe young guy working as very nice despite the fact he was obviously SLAMMED.  I should've taken the clue that 1 guy taking all the orders, pouring all the coffee, and having to run around the bar to pick up the to go food was a harbinger of issues to come, but I forged on.  He took my name and gave me my receipt.  As time continued to pass I started forgetting who ordered what and when and I noticed the crowd outside of the restaurant continued to grow, and grow, and grow.  It was cool though, I still had 20 minutes left.  Around the 25 minutes of waiting mark I figured it was time to see if I was close.  As I waited in the line AGAIN, to check the status of my food, I noticed that 3 of the 7 people in the line were doing the same thing.  I reached the front, informed the clerk that I NEEDED my food because I'd waited 30 minutes and my plane was boarding soon.  He informed me my food was up soon.  I waited about 7-8 more minutes after that and was handed my burrito.  No bag, no napkin.  Just the burrito.  As I ran off I overheard another lady requesting a refund because she couldn't wait for her food anymore.\n\nOnce I finally boarded my plane (and had to check my bag because I was one of the last 5 people to enter it), I was ready to eat.  The burrito itself was \"meh\" at best.  The standout was the bacon, it was amazing and it was obviously this wasn't some low cost meat, I found myself wishing the rest of the burrito emulated this taste.  It didn't.  The eggs had next to no flavor and were oily, and I'm about 90% sure the potatoes were cooked in some form of olive oil as well, because that's the only taste they had.  \n\nOverall, I wished I had as great an experience as everyone else who sat down, ate and reviewed, however I wasn't so lucky.  Beyond having a friendly person, the express counter was a joke (40 minutes, that's good right?) and the burrito beyond the bacon completely lacked flavor.  Maybe it was just a bad day I attended, but I don't know if I'll roll the dice again.  If you go, make sure you have an hour plus and skip the burrito.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible service terrible food. The fresh squeeze Oj is not freshly squeezed at all. Food is super slow. I asked the waitress to check on my food since I have a flight to catch. Her attitude was if u don't have dont don't eat here\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoy fruit flies swarming around your beverage, having your meal given to the table next to you (and eaten before they discovered the problem), slow service, then THIS is YOUR place!  Hopefully I Will not get sick from the flies in my beverage!!!  \nGuess I will need to wait for the next 48 to 72 hours to see if I get sick.  \nI expect this in a foreign country or open air restaurant but not at an airport!\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped at this place for breakfast and drinks when heading home from a work/play trip. The food was great but the alcohol was even better ! Try the Bloody Mary, it contains the full package. Bacon, olives, celery, cheese blocks, it is like a meal with a side of booze ! It gets very busy !\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a person that travels for a living I've had my share of bad airport food but this place makes up for all of it. Excellent food, fresh, plentiful and great service. I will make it a point to visit them again and I bookmarked the main restaurant in the city. \nThe waffles were perfect and the Reuben was too. \nDon't hesitate to visit them when you're at the Phoenix airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat airport food but service was over the top.  Michael waited on us and was not only very engaging and attentive but he also made sure we got our order to go on short notice.  Mediocre airport food and service seems to be the standard but this place stood out enough for me to write a review.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaffing needs work. I'm at an airport. I want a breakfast burrito. They took my order and 20 min later I asked for a refund. Ni complaints from me. I just have to go. There are 4 burritos ahead of me. Manager starts yelling at the staff, refunds my order and takes someone's elses burrito and gives it to me. I'm like look its ok I don't want you to throw together an order. Relax. He doesn't. Burrito that he hands me after I take it and run to my flight, is completely different and a mess nor cooked.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow. I stumbled across this place on a layover, and to be honest, didn't have high expectations since it's airport food, right? I was so wrong-fresh orange juice, thick peppered bacon, awesome home fries, and big pieces of homemade wheat bread toasted just right, with delicious raspberry jam. It was a little pricey, but nothing out of the norm for an airport restaurant. I'm flying through PHX again in a few weeks, and I'll definitely walk however far to eat here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood quick eatery in the B - Gates of the airport.  They are zagat rated which was surprising, but I can tell the ingredients was quality.  Food came out a bit cold and was missing ingredients from what the menu stated.  All considered, I'd go back but not rush back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome food, i ordered Chop and chic. \nLovely food and ambiance, would stop by here again. I have been to pheonix airport so many times but did not happen to be here. \nWill recommend for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst review ever about an airport restaurant as they are usually mediocre at best.  But just had best airport breakfast ever with perfectly cooked over easy eggs, thick cut bacon, home fries cooked with onion and rosemary, and a nutty home grain toast with fresh raspberry jam, and locally roasted coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The service was quick and the waiter was friendly and unhurried; he even brought me a large go cup of coffee gratis.  The restaurant was like an oasis in the desert after suffering all the indignities of PHX TSA. I will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI travel a lot....thrilled with new restaurant options. Matts is first disappointment.   20+ min for a less than mediocre Reuben.  Olive & Ivy much better and worth the hike to A gates.....and most likely faster!\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's is definitely a go to food place while traveling through sky harbor!\n\nI travel a lot for work and I am always flying out of sky harbor airport, when I do I usually always stop by Matt's. They have a variety of stuff to choose from, everything from breakfast to burgers as well as some great sandwiches. You get a lot of bang for your buck as well, most places in the airport are super expensive and you don't get a lot of food. Matt's gives you great size portions! They are also very quick so if you are in a hurry but don't want to eat fast food, Matt's will get you in and out in a hurry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place had the best service of any airport restaurant I have been to. They were busy and short staffed but everyone who helped us was cheerful and quick. We got our food fast, our drinks faster. It tasted great. Amazing place!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMBB needs to first understand this isn't 5-star fine dining and people are here because THEY ARE FLYING TODAY\nUnbelievable slow service in an half empty restaurant and no food after 20 minutes from ordering with waiters all standing around talking to one another \n\nPeople - it's an airport - everyone has somewhere to go  - and I did- I walked out\n\n\n\n\n\nButter fried chili burrito and green honey ice tea while Waiting for next flight!  Friendly not cheap.though\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk your server what's good. I'll give you a hint, *ANYTHING* with the word  \"salad\" in it is a dud. Not because I don't like salad, I LOVE salads! But the fancy salad, tossed \"cobb\" salad, egg salad sandwich, tuna salad sandwich, and macaroni salad are all VERY bland. Trust me on this one. And the tomato soup tastes like maranara sauce, but is super good for dipping the awesome grilled cheese into. Tomato soup by itself....meh. Plus....it's $7 DOLLARS for one bowl of tomato soup. No. Everything else is well worth the money. If you have any issues with your food ever, just let your server know (nicely) and they'll gladly fix it for you, seriously. Also...they don't carry ranch. WHAT!?!?! In America?????? Lame. But all their food is seriously thebomb. com, and I suggest you get with your server to help you choose. they're usually WAY busy,  but most of the time very friendly and willing to give you an honest opinion. \n\nPersonally, I recommend the Sweet N Savory french toast. WOW. And that applewood smoked pork sausage???? WWWWOWWWW\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ended up here after our late evening layover flight dropped us off.  We had an hour and a half to kill, so we wandered about the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport unsure what eatery or drinkery to patronize.  Many places were somewhat busy, but Matt's Big Breakfast was spacious enough to draw our attention.  Even though Matt's advertises breakfast, they have a full bar also!  This was our first official day of vacation and decided to celebrate with a cocktail. We found room at the bar and ordered drinks.  I got a Patron Tequila Sunrise, while Joe K ordered a Captain Morgan rum & coke.  They actually offer you choices of premium brand liquors.  Our beverages came in ample sized glasses and they really hit the spot, quenched our thirsts and gave us a mellowing buzz.  Joe was not feeling well and was having a hard time relaxing, so the cocktails were a welcome availability.  Even though our drinks cost $14.00 each, it was a nice splurge that we don't often indulge in. \n\nAs for the food, I can't form an opinion on, but other patrons received some delicious looking meals.  And yes, those breakfasts were quite big!  If we were hungry and had more time, I would have definitely tried out their breakfast!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this new breakfast option in Sky Harbor! Been there twice now (first time was late afternoon). The service at the bar was friendly and fast both times. Bacon Bloody Mary's adorned with cheese, pepperoncini and a thick slab of pepper bacon are a must! The waffle is light and fluffy and delicious. The omelette is big, cheesy & comes with mounds of home fries perfectly seasoned.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusy place! Delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. I probably could have just ordered a gallon for breakfast. Service varied - some people were great but a few that seemed like they didn't care. Pancakes a little dry.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely the best place to stop by for food when in the PHX airport - perhaps the only place to get a decent meal! I ordered a salad to go. The woman behind the counter was super kind to me in talking to me about the different food options they have, as well as getting me a menu to order something directly from the kitchen. I ordered Tossed Cobb and waited a few minutes for it to get prepared. I realized two minutes later that the salad was already available in the refrigerated section, but the woman insisted that I order a freshly-made salad. And it was delectable! Warm chicken on top of crisp vegetables, and enormous - this is the kind of salad I want for $10. Next time, I'll try the true breakfast items that this place is known for.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas in town for a training event and had to check this place out! Saw it on Triple D and it was as advertised if not better! The service was fantastic (all the girls were very attentive and friendly) and the food was amazing! Probably one of the best waffles I've ever had anywhere! The home fries, toast, and bacon was top notch!  I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in town! If you haven't been, you gotta check it out!\n\n\n\n\n\nI travel a lot and this is by far the very best in airport food if not in all of burger-dom.\n\nI picked this place at random as it was near my gate and I am so glad I did.  The food and service were outstanding.\n\nI sat at one of the high top tables.  Plenty of room for my bag under my feet sitting there.  It was lunch so I ordered a burger.  I ordered straight from the menu, but many people requested special needs burgers and they were happy to comply.   My burger came out fast, it was cooked to perfection, very flavorful, well seasoned and just the right temperature.\n\nMy iced tea was fresh and clean.\n\nMy server, Valentin, was top notch.  A fun guy who took care of everyone with special requests and understood that in an airport environment people need to eat fast and pay fast.  He made each person around me feel special and like they were his only customer.  I can't explain it. Some people just have a gift of working with the public.  He offered to get me a to go cup of iced tea.  He is now a friend for life.\n\nI fly into Phoenix a lot so I will be a regular customer here and, in fact, look forward to it being a highlight of future trips.\n\nIt's that good.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Service disappointing. Irritated host around my request for a specific table. Server dripped coffee on my leather jacket; didn't seem too concerned, but did bring napkins after I already used the napkin on the rolled silverware to clean her mess. Table was ridiculously wobbly; there goes more coffee into the table. Good thing she brought clean-up napkins already. \n\n- Food disappointing. Lemonade tasted like dirty dishwater; replaced with coke which tasted fine. Ruben sandwich was a let down. Grilled bread was not well grilled; more of a greasy, un-browned mess. Corned beef was a little scarce, especially for the price. \n\n- Overall impression. I've heard good things about the MBB downtown but only had the patience to wait in line once in my life (my recollection was the breakfast was...ho hum). This was the first I've heard of MBB in the airport. It was generally disappointing and I wouldn't go back if I had other options. Also based on the Reuben, the place clearly shouldn't be called Matt's Big Lunch.... Final tip - there's a Wendy's two shops down.\n\n\n\n\n\nSat down and had the Mamacita burger with seasoned fries. Possibly the best airport meal I've ever had. The server was great, the food was out quickly, and unlike McDonald's didn't look like it was rushed to be put together. The bacon was crispy, the bun was lightly toasted and perfect and the burger itself was cooked as I asked and tasted awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone with 20 minutes to enjoy some great food.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food. Got a veggie scramble. A lot of food! Good house potatoes that are seasoned with rosemary. The rye bread was very good also. Only complaint was the water tasted gross and consequently the ice tea tasted gross. They should use filtered water if the tap is that bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW! I just needed some breakfast and got a lot more than I came for! The thick cut bacon was amazing, the eggs were cooked exactly to order, and the bread came along with some really good jam. This place only uses the best ingredients. I'll be going to this place anytime I'm at at the Phoenix airport - even if it's not time for breakfast!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis airport location is an insult to the actual restaurant. First, like all airport restaurants, this was overpriced. The chili bowl was extremely small and I ordered a side of steak fries. There were less than 10 fries. To make things worse, I waited 25 minutes for takeout. \n\nI had to eat the chili on the plane because I didn't have time. The staff did not pack my oyster crackers and the chili was small and way too salty.\n\nThe fries lacked taste. I loved the Phoenix Matt's Big Breakfast and hated this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided to stop here in the airport while I waited for my flight. Although they were busy I was greeted and automatically offered a drink and menu. I ordered the Matt's big breakfast with medium well eggs. Everything was really good, kind of with it was cooked just a tad bit longer for the eggs. However, the potatoes were perfectly seasoned the pancake was just right light sweet flavor to it and everything else was just right. I enjoyed the food and customer service. I'd go back when visiting.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust had breakfast prior to my flight. This location not as good as original in downtown Phoenix. Matt needs to oversee more.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I start? Let's start with a server who looked like he was going to have a complete breakdown- came over to take drink orders and I guess 2 seconds was to long for him because he told my husband sorry no offense sir but I have other tables and he walked away without taking his drink order. Ohhhhhh k We were then greeted by another server who said he would take our order (thank goodness) well.... we got our food and the pancakes were burnt and turned over to hide it. My BLT was falling apart at the seams. How do you people get away with this??? Fail\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid portions, very flavorful, quick and great service!  \n\nConveniently located and good atmosphere with full bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I punish myself. I had an hour before my flight so I gave them another shot.  Seriously, what takes so long to cook 2 eggs?  After 25 minutes and 2 server apologies later my order arrived with bacon instead of sausage. I grabbed the plate and said \"i don't have time for you to fix it\". They brought me sausage. Right away. Hey they can cook some things fast.  Just a mistake to stop here at the airport before your flight. Give yourself more than an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh man, I am so glad that a super friendly patron sat next me because the service was disappointing. With that being said, the food was really good.\n\nService: No one cleaned the area I sat at, it took a while for anyone to get me a drink, my order was wrong and I asked for an iced tea to go twice and didn't get one. Luckily, the nice fellow that sat next me ordered an iced tea to go and he gave me his. \n\nGood: While my order was wrong, I did enjoy what I got which was the breakfast burrito without jalapeos and potatoes. Also, their salsa is bomb.com! I want to buy it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch out!  They charge $1.50 if you need more than an ounce of maple syrup. As if the prices weren't already jacked up as an airport eatery.  \n\nGood thing Matt doesn't manage the restrooms at Sky Harbor!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was looking for a place to eat in the airport and even though this place only has 3.5 stars overall I decided to give it a chance. I ordered everything ala carte because there was no combo that actually matched what I wanted. I had two eggs, a pancake, and homefries. Everything was DELICIOUS. The pancake was nice and thin and barely needed syrup or butter. The homefries were amazing and the eggs cooked perfect. Total came out to around $14 incl. tip which isn't too bad. I would go back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nChili is one step down from Wendy's and about 4 times the cost. Even more regrettable was the service and the 20-min wait to get the said order to-go. In an airport, not making your clients sick and timeliness are probably the top 2 minimum objectives. Customers behind me received their orders sooner, which is not great when the waiting time starts to encroach into your boarding time. The most in-your-face obstinance was the supervisor's insistence that, \"well, we have to heat it up individually.\" Yea, okay, soup can be boiled in like 4 minutes and soondobu can be made from scratch in less than 20 min. So no, uh-uh, no thank you, never again. I'll know better next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nTues morning 6am ,we stood at the hostess table ,  older gentleman behind the bars looked up at us ,looked around then went back to counting money never once saying hello welcome or kiss my ass. We waited at the hostess station for a few minutes before being seated. Ordered our food and our severs was without any personality. Took our order and a guy in the kitchen screamed are order to the cooks. Our food was served up quickly. I ordered a egg sandwich with bacon and potatoes, on a scale of one to ten , with ten being the best , the sandwich was a 2 , it was hot and fresh but void of favors ! Server never checked on us. The place was clean and bright .  It's better then the Wendy's but not by much.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery good breakfast that was well prepared.  The Bloody Mary is an excellent choice. It comes with a salad bar in it! I highly recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\n1/8 of a star but it's not an option this picture should tell you why and not to mention the server told me that he couldn't take my drink order because he had other tables he still need to get to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BEST burger I have ever had in my life.  The Msmacita cooked rare, OMG, the grass fed beef just melted in my mouth.  Whenever I fly through here I hope my layover allows me to make a stop.\n\nGive it a try, and service was great during my visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best airport breakfast I've ever had. Free range eggs, house made home-fries and thick cut bacon- delicious!! You can order to - go if you don't have time to sit down and be waited on . My to-go order was quick!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood breakfast spot from the B-terminal.  Our family landed at 6 am with a 3 hour layover until our next flight.  The hot coffee is decent.  We got Matt's Big Breakfast x 2.  One order we subbed the griddle cake for toast.  The griddle cake is sweet and delicious (almost reminiscent of corn bread).  The toast was a large slice of multi-grain with a very tasty raspberry jam.  We also got sweet and savory which includes two french toast with a sausage.  \n\nThe short: good place for breakfast indeed!\n\n\n\n\n\nFLY THRU BREAKFAST\n\nI was flying through the PHX airport & had a 3 hour layover. I searched Yelp & found many 4 star restaurants. How could this be? It's an airport! Airports never have good food, so I decided to spend some time walking around checking them out before making my choice. I finally decided to eat at Matt's because it seemed like the all American Breakfast. \n\nThe place was packed at 8:30 in the morning. I wanted to sit at the bar but took the first available seat at a community table. I then noticed there were power outlets scattered through the space but not every seat had access to power. I then asked the hostess if she could find me a spot where I could eat and juice up my phone. She spotted an opening at the bar & told me to grab it. When I arrived I had to squeeze between two guys. My new neighbors were excited to learn about the outlets & they quickly plugged in their devices. So be aware power is available here you're just going to need to find it before you sit down. \n\nI looked through the menu & I wanted to eat everything. I finally decided to go with Matt's Big Breakfast. It had a little bit of everything. I must also point out that the food is made fresh from scratch with the finest local ingredients around. I love that & I could taste that love in the food. \n\nMy dish came with 3 fresh cage free eggs which I ordered sunny side up. These eggs were no yolk. The eggs tasted amazing & reminded me of Phil's Organic Eggs we buy in the Chicagoland area.  This place locally sources there food & it makes a difference. \n\nThe thick cut bacon is from a local butcher in Queen Creek, AZ & it was so delicious. It was cooked perfectly & had hints of pepper on it. My breakfast even had sausage that was formed into patties. The sausage came from a local butcher up the street near their downtown location. It was some of the freshest sausage I've ever had. I loved it because it reminded me of the sausage patties I make at home for breakfast. It is so nice to have a hand formed patty &!not something over processed & frozen in a factory. \n\nI really liked the home fries. I'm usually not a fan because this breakfast item at other restaurants is always tasteless & dry but not here. A lot of love goes into this side dish. They take Yukon Gold Potatoes, first boil them, then they bake them and finally finish them off by frying them in butter. They also add some sauted onions & then season them with salt, pepper & rosemary. These potatoes are as good as my breakfast potatoes & I don't share that kind of compliment with just anyone. \n\nI washed all of that down with a house made griddle cake which is just a fancy word for pancake. This was one of the best pancakes I've had in a long time. The best part it was topped with real sweet cream butter & real Maple syrup. Both of these toppings pushed this amazing griddle cake beyond extraordinary. I didn't use all the butter but it tasted like real butter which is something I don't taste anymore with all of the fake processed food we are being served. I'd like to pass a law that says, \"If there is no Real Syrup then you can not serve pancakes!\"  Sorry Aunt Jemima but you don't cut it anymore. Real is the way to go. \n\nPrior to leaving to go & catch my plane I stopped at the pass to tell the staff how much I loved their food. I wanted them to know I appreciated all of their hard work.  They were cranking out some great food. The kitchen space is not big at all yet they kept making fantastic food to hungry travelers. \n\nThere were many breakfast options on the menu. I was enjoying seeing what all my neighbors at the bar were getting.  The scrambled eggs with spicy salami looked so good. It was on my list but it didn't come with a pancake so I opted for Matt's Big Breakfast. The breakfast sandwich & breakfast burrito looked good too. I would love to mention that this place is priced great & it won't break your travel budget. My whole dish was $12.50 which is totally reasonable for everything I ordered. \n\nI must mention that there is a full bar. Everyone around me was drinking but it was 8:30am on a Friday morning. I couldn't do it, after 8 days in Vegas. I really didn't want to see liquor again.  The real temptation was when the person across from me ordered one of the Bloody Mary's. I wanted to ask them if I could take a photo of it but I didn't want to be that guy. It was one of those that was not only a drink but a meal too.  I will always have an image of that masterpiece in my head. \n\nSo if you're flying through PHX then do your foodie homework because there are many great options to eat at here. You will really be surprised at all the great ratings for the restaurants. I do highly recommend you stop in here for breakfast. Matt's has a great All-American breakfast that will keep you going all day long. You make me want to connect through PHX now when I fly.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeeding my protein for supper, and my low carbs. Love that I found a place in the terminal at PHX that serves breakfast all day. The hostess, Chyrisse, was extremely helpful and friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an airport breakfast this restaurant was over the top. The breakfast sandwich was excellent. I think the key was the sauted sweet onion and the excellent roll it was made on. Our server was also excellent I asked for a little more coffee right as the bill came and she filled up a to-go cup for me.  My girlfriend got a Bloody Mary that I am pretty sure could have served as a meal in itself. And the price wasn't bad for an airport. The breakfast sandwich with potatoes was $10 and too much food for me to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing all of the reviews when we first moved out here, we decided to give it a shot one morning while exploring Phoenix. We really weren't all that impressed. The food was \"ok,\" the service was \"ok,\" the dining area left something to be desired, for sure, and was incredibly noisy. I guess if we're around the area and literally can't find anything else, we may stop by again... But it was just \"ok.\" We don't understand the hype.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food, great drinks, and even better service! I had a couple lovely ladies serving me and keeping me company as I was flying alone and arrived to the airport way too early! The only thing about this place that bothered me was their god awful uniforms! Those shirts would be better worn for servicing the plane over serving me drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place gets you with the smell because smells really good, but do make sure you have time to wait for your food. A simple sandwich to go it took over 20 minutes. I am just glad I had time to wait for my flight. The staff however is great, very friendly and accommodating.\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews scared me a little but I can say my experience was very good...\nservice was exceptional. I had the French toast and sausage...very good...and the orange juice is fresh squeezed...at least that's how it tasted...none of that funny added sugar many restaurants serve...for an airport extremely reasonably priced....had the sausage not been a little over cooked this would have been 5 star rating\n\n\n\n\n\nFood isn't bad for an airport restaurant. Service is HORRIBLE!  No teamwork, tons of servers, but no structure, people grouped up talking, I would say it's horribly managed..... waited 30 minutes for a BLT with chips. Never once checked on my drinks or came by to inform me of the hold up. Do yourself a favor and keep walking......\n\n\n\n\n\nI love  Matts Big Breakfast  but this location isn't the same as the one I go in downtown Phoenix.\nThey don't have any hash browns which is a must have every time I go to Matts. The toast here was not even warm my butter didn't even melt (wtf)? It looked like they were pre toasting the bread to save time. I asked the waitress and she said it's what they do since it gets so \"busy\". I've seen the original location twice as \"busy\" as this place but they don't half assed on their quality.\n\nSave yourself the disappointment and go to the downtown location.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy flight was in another terminal, but I came to the airport early so I could go to Matt's. My last experience was good. This experience was not so good. The sonrisa burrito is nothing to smile about. The garnish on the Bloody Mary was stale.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in while waiting for a connecting flight. Absolutely awesome cheeseburger. One of the best I've ever had. Not something you'd expect at an airport. Service was great too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSLOOOOOOWWWWW. Do not come here if you have any sort of limitations on time - not even for take out. I've been here a million times and there is NO sense of urgency from anyone. To greet your table, to take orders, to get you anything. I know this and still made the mistake of ordering take out. Why it could possibly take 25+ minutes to make scrambled eggs & toast to go is beyond me. The food is good but not worth the excessive waiting. It borders on ridiculous. The staff is hit or miss with friendliness - but usually miss.\n\n\n\n\n\nDang this place was good! Before traveling, my SO and I stopped here to eat since we had time and I was not disappointed. The hostess was a bit dry, bored, and wrung out but the rest of the staff was very welcoming and friendly so I won't let her influence my opinion. This place seems like the spot that would be packed all of the time, so expect to be rubbing elbows with a stranger while you eat. Aside from this, the food was great! I got their grilled cheese and french fries which were fantastic, they use a really thick bread which made the sandwich even better. I would definitely come here again...if I'm ever delayed and forced to fly Southwest again -_____-\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a meeting this morning in Phoenix landed at the Skyharbor Airport. Tip on traveling coast to coast, eat before flying. I was scared to eat that I might be going to the bathroom during the flight. Lucky, I had water and some crackers to fill me for my flight. Once I landed I headed over to MBB for the chop & chick with OJ and homefries. A splendid meal well cooked and the eggs were fresh. Their menu caters to most fans but I can't wait to go home tomorrow and try their other selections. Fresh and tender the chop and fries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a an amazing addition to an airport. The food is absolutely delicious. If there is a wait it is worth it!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis absolutely the best and most reasonable airport food around!!  Had the omelet with mushrooms, peppers and bacon - done to perfection!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the Cobb salad and a diet coke. The food was excellent and a great option at sky harbor airport. The bartender was very friendly and even noted to someone else how great the Reuben sandwich is.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust popped in for a quick bite and glass of wine between flights.... the bartender was wonderful -- fast and attentive, but not intrusive and the grilled cheese w tomato soup was probably the best decision I've made all day.  It could stand to have a little bit more cheese, but totally delicious-hits-the-spot-comfort-food otherwise. \n\nThe only thing that I found to be bad was he host -- a young man. He was looking down at his phone and did not look up at all as I approached nor as I was standing in front of him. He asked \"bar or table\" without even looking up but completed his text message. I waited for him to at least make eye contact at which point he asked me again, \"bar Or table\" in a tone that made me feel as though I was seriously inconveniencing him.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally good airport food. I've eaten here a few times since it has a great location amongst the American Airlines gates. They have pretty great food and the only comment I have is that the service is spotty. Overall I've had good service but the last few visits the tables around me have gotten their food first, even if it was the same as my order.\nAll in all I will definitely go back, but don't stop to eat in if you have less than an hour to spend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the bar I ordered the standard two egg breakfast, named some kind of hipster BS like two chicks and a pig or something. I opted for fruit instead of the home fries. My server was prompt and the drinks / food came quickly, however, the fruit was so old looking I couldn't bring myself to eat it. One of my pet peeves is wasting food so I can't recall a time I sent something back but in this case I was willing to forego that side all together. The server tried without me asking to get a fresher bowl but she even admitted upon her return from the kitchen that it all looked unappetizing. She didn't offer another side of anything else to make up for the rotten fruit. If you have the time for a sit down meal, take a moment to find another eatery. In hindsight, I'm sure Wendy's next door would have been better...\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind, any time you're dining at the Airport, there are going to be some expensive prices that you'd definitely reconsider elsewhere. This is the case here. A burger and a drink (lemonade) cost $18.72 prior to the tip. Yikes! This is not \"horrible\" but at the same time it is higher than what I would have valued the food at. \n\nSteak fries seemed to be prepackaged. Burger was \"just ok.\" My friend asked what it would cost to add jalapenos to her burger and was told 2$ -- deary me, that was a no go, and put a bad taste in our mouths. \n\nService was slow on getting the food out. The server, however, was somewhat apologetic about it. All in all is was just an average/ok experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered a Cheese Omelet to go. After 35 min. went to counter to inquire how much longer. Cashiers came back saying she didn't know what happened to order. I requested a refund as I was going to be late for flight. Manager showed up 8 minutes later, to inform me she had to issue refund through my e-mail. No apology was given and still have not received a refund!\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's was certainly enjoyable (all locally grown organic for my BIGGEST bfast-love the peppered bacon) and Michael (server) was a treat. This world needs more of his spirit, especially in this profession.  Keep smiling!\n\n\n\n\n\nCame back because I recalled having a nice breakfast about 1-year ago. My connecting flight is at another terminal and left there to try this breakfast again.\nHad Matt's Biggest Breakfast for $13.99. Sausage and bacon were special. Would have preferred the toast over the so-so pancake. \nEggs came out slightly more 'easy' than 'medium', but was acceptable for me since I like it either way. \nSat at bar. Katie provided good service while working the bar. Checked back. Kept busy. Even made sure my water was refilled. Thanks Katie.\n(normally don't write reviews)\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew was my server and he was fantastic!  He was prompt, efficient, friendly, and got my order right!  He was working a number of tables and I was quite impressed watching him maneuver and ensure everyone was cared for.  The restaurant is in Terminal 4 so quite busy but they seemed to be turning the tables well.  I had just a couple minute wait but they also have an express option - takeout area - for those that don't have time.  I had an omelet that was very good.  The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable.  The hostess was friendly as was the person that delivered my food.  Good experience all around - which I certainly appreciate when in the midst of airport hustle/bustle.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped by Matt's at Sky Harbor waiting for an evening flight.  I ordered the Sonrisa Burrito (no meat) which contains eggs, cheese, potato, & jalapeno.  Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner? :) The waiter asked if I would prefer Avocado in lieu of the meat - so I bit and asked for it on the side.  I also requested extra jalapeno.  \n\nFor an adult beverage, I ordered a double Tanqueray and soda water with lime.  \n\nThe drink came out first.  Immediately I could tell two things: it wasn't Tanqueray in my glass, and the drink was definitely not a double (although it was in a tall glass.)  I mentioned the drink to my waiter, and he explained that a double is 2 ounces, not the customary 3.  I requested an additional double (neat) to test my theory.  Sure enough, it was not what I had ordered, it was well gin (brand unknown.)  I wont speculate as to why - draw your own conclusions.  All in, my premium double was $30, and it was not premium or drinkable.  \n\nOn to the burrito:  in AZ (generally speaking) if you order jalapenos, the unspoken rule is that they will be fresh.  In this case, they were pickled nacho slices and missing all of the fresh jalapeno flavor.  The eggs were burnt to a crisp, and this is coming from a guy who does not specifically enjoy the classic runny yolk or French omelette.  They put the avocado in the burrito instead of on the side.  On top of being extremely overcooked, the eggs and potatoes were completely under-seasoned... no salt or pepper that I could taste.  The side of salsa was mediocre, but edible.  \n\nTo sum it up: at Sky Harbor, find food and beverage elsewhere.  I left with a $50 tab (I did tip the waiter, as he was courteous and quick.) For $50 bucks, I had a few sips of a beverage I did not order and a few bites of a bad burrito.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a great breakfast.  Fresh home style cooking.  Not frozen and reheat like what would be expected from an Airport eatery.  If you're hungry and looking for good food Matt's is the place.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, so the bacon was amazing, there's the 1 star... but if you order an alcoholic drink don't order the liquor. Well liquor (base model) is over $12 dollars a shot. These are more than the highest Priced clubs in Scottsdale. So if you're catching a flight and think, oh a screwdriver would be nice... think again, or go elsewhere. The prices are outrageous and the staff was crazy defensive about me questioning the price. Yo, this isn't the Encore in Vegas.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent food for an airport. \nEverything was fresh and all American. \nWas disappointed in the foul language coming from one of the servers who wasn't quite sure what he wanted to be yet?? \nFood was great. Language and his obnoxious demeanor were strange.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I had an awful 13 hour lay over in Phoenix. We arrived around 8 pm and our flight wasn't until 10 am the next morning. The original plan was to eat a good dinner and try to fall asleep... Unfortunately our plan didn't work out. \n\nWe didn't get our bags until about 845 and all the restaurants were closed, so we scarfed down a pizza. Around 2 am I was searching on Yelp for some good breakfast. \n\nI got the steak and eggs and it was cooked to perfection. Most steak and eggs are overly cooked but this steak was JUICY. My wife got a waffle with bacon. The waffle was so fluffy and had just about enough sweetness. The bacon here is also amazing. Never had bacon like this before. It was a thicker cut and seasoned with pepper. She also got a mimosa and I got a Bloody Mary. Both were really good. Thanks Matt's Big Breakfast for making this long lay over enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible place.  Bacon and potatoes are covered in pepper.  Eggs over easy were raw and cold.  Toast was cold.\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good. Better than most other airport food place. I had cheese omelet w all the add ons. Makes it a $13.99 omelette but was pretty good. Onions were a little mushy but not bad. I would recommend this place. Almost worth 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\nNo wait to sit at the counter what a mistake. Worst service I ever had. No set no acknowledging I was there ask for coffee twice.  No silverware.  Never got a refill.  Order came out cold\n\nJust a horrible service experience. And the restaurant was only two thirds full.  If you need to be ignored and eat overpriced even by airport standards cold food. Served by staff that should not be dealing with the public then eat here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere aren't that many good places to eat in Sky Harbor...mainly bland chains or local restaurants trying to do their best impression of their original location but falling far from the same. This Matt's is definitely not as good as the original in downtown Phoenix, but when you have no choice and need a good breakfast before your flight, stopping here is a fairly good choice. My wife and I ordered the hog and chick. The meat was savory and the egg was adequately seasoned. I loved how the bacon was a little more wet/chewy than dry/crispy, as I tend to dislike the latter. I didn't get a chance to try their signature pancakes this time but they didn't look that bad either.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is great!!!!!! Great food,  fast service and fresh food.   If I'm ever in the Phoenix airport again I'll be back\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you check out my profile, you will see that I don't often leave negative reviews, however I'm going to have to add one for the terrible food I received here today.\n\nI ordered the Biggest Breakfast with scrambled eggs and what came out can only be described as the single worst plate of breakfast \"food\" I have ever received. Most of the components where flat out inedible. My scrambled eggs were the consistency of an eraser. The eggs were clearly forgotten about on the griddle and simply chopped up when it came time to plate them, after they set into hard plastic discs. The sausage was even worse! Small salty dried out pucks. I actually knocked them on the plate and they made a hard pinging sound which amused my neighbors. The potatoes were soggy with grease and tasted like funky rosemary. My hotcake came out flat as a crepe. It at least was edible after I drenched it in butter and syrup. Even the bacon was dry and chewy. How do you mess up bacon???\n\nI hope the management starts to pay better attention to the quality of the food being served. I've worked in restaurants before so I know breakfast can be especially hard to manage and I don't like leaving bad reviews but what happened today was inexcusable.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick service all around. Amazing food... Sky Harbor has revamped their food choices and I can honestly say this place is up there with Arizona top breakfast places (heard good things about their other locations as well.)\nGreat ok every way. \nOh, and the bacon. The bacon was unbelievable.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't believe what a great breakfast place this is at the airport they need to open all over the valley if you are in terminal B ask for Katie she rocks!!! Great friendly customer service !!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI honestly believe the food and setup here is better than the original restaurant downtown.  I had the breakfast sandwich on toast instead of the roll (highly recommend).  If you have an hour plus until your flight and want some breakfast, look no further.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeating service was slow for an airport.  Breakfast was big serving but toast came out cold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a joke.  They are supposed to open at 6:30.  At 6:50 we're still waiting to seated because \"we've gotten a late  start\".  Then, someone, a server, finally suggested to the manager sitting with her coffee playing around on her lap top, that they could open the to go place line only. I'm sorry, but I have no patience with business owners / bad managers that can't get their stuff together.  Great way to kill s business.  I know I will NEVER PATRONIZE THIS  ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN.\n\n\n\n\n\nWould love to tell you about the food but I stood at the entry for a few minutes and then left. No sign about seating yourself or waiting. No employee made eye contact. Guess they don't need our business.\n\n\n\n\n\nSit down breakfast options are super limited in the Phoenix airport and Matt's in generally packed.  I ordered the salami scramble and fresh juice that was pretty good.  Service was okay.  Nothing spectaular, nothing terrible.  OK option if you're not in a big hurry.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Breakfast and their bacon is to die for...I always stop when flying thru..skip their brkfst sausage tho but be sure to get a Bloody Mary...Yumm!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meal was great, whole wheat  toast was very tasty with preserves and blueberry  lemonade was thrist quenching!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a chain breakfast spot that serves breakfast foods all day. This location is in the airport. You can order at the counter and get it to-go or sit-down with waiter service. This place has bar seating as well. I tried the $13 chili cheese burger and the $9 breakfast burrito served with chorizo. You could choose sausage or bacon instead of chorizo. The burger was huge and came with a side of French fries. My bf thought they didn't give enough fries. The burrito came with a side of pico de gallo. It wasn't enough so I asked for a 2nd but I think 3 would have been enough for me. I liked the burrito more than the burger. It was surprisingly super spicy. The burger had an awesome fluffy bun but a very thin piece of meat and some drier chunks of ground beef in the chili. The chili was more just ground beef and some beans than a chili. It wasn't very wet at all. The shredded cheese inside wasn't really melted. The water they gave tasted like there was a bit of lime. It had a metal flavor to me. I like the interior decor (had a giant pig on the wall and large bench-style seats with long round leather pillows) and music playlist (indie music). Their downtown location was featured on the TV show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was excited when I had enough time till my flight to eat here. I was a little underwhelmed considering how much people love this place. \n\nThey were accommodating and quick, which is important for an airport restaurant obviously. \n\nI ordered the breakfast burrito. It has too many Jalepenos and not enough other flavors. I had to pick half of them out and then add salt pepper and hot sauce for it to taste good. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish?? Maybe the one in dt phx is better? I wanted to love it but it was just bland. \n\nI'm willing to give it another shot but no breakfast burrito for me again.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food and service. Waiter Michael is a treasure! Our family was heading to Bakersfield : ( and he managed to put a smile on our faces- service with a smile and truckloads of personality!! Don't let him go!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have no words for this one. Those place, as the name implies, is a breakfast place. That's their emphasis. So why do they have no half- and half for coffee?  All they have is milk. Saying this is a gross oversight would be an understatement.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou had me at Bacon Bloody Mary. With it's rimmed bacon salt, stuffed olives, cheese, and its penultimate bacon, I was surprised how effective this airport spot was. Could go without the pickle, but that's my preference. I don't write too much for airport eateries, but this one in Phoenix has reason to return between flights.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe waiter Micheal is amazing and makes this place a great place to eat. Keep it going Michael.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere 5-10 min.  Employees make eye contact then ignore. Tell manager and she gives me the \"oh so sorry\" scripted response.  Terrible customer service and based on mgrs response I know why.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were surprised to find Matt's Big Breakfast at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. We usually visit the downtown location when we travel to Phoenix, but ran out of time this trip.  \nLow and Behold, we got our fix at the airport.\nThe menu is a little different than the restaurant. Caters to breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \nThe food is still great!\n\n\n\n\n\nTasty, well priced with pleasant and quick service.  Matt's uses the best ingredients and it makes a difference.  Portions are very healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCannot overstate what a great experience this was. Gotta start with the food: my griddle cakes were amazing and my wife's waffle was just about as good. Delicious thick slab, peppered bacon was the perfect side. Coffee was not as good as the food (always the conundrum-give up coffee shop quality for better food?), but at least plentiful. Service was beyond friendly, though marred by lacking silverware after our food was served (thankfully, the butter still melted). Probably the best airport dining experience I ever had. Hope our connection next week allows time for a return engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was decent, but customer service needs an improvement. Cleanliness also needs to improve.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing Bloody Mary with a slick slice of bacon, 2 chunks of cheddar and pepper jack cheese plus olives and a pickle. Not too strong but not weak,  a prefect drunk for a long morning! Loved the breakfast sandwich and the breakfast burrito with jalapeos, pefect amount of kick :) wish we had one in Portland Oregon!\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are not enough words to describe how much I like Matt's. It is the most awesome breakfast place ... not just in Phoenix, not just at the Airport, but it is the top of our list ANYWHERE! We recently had the opportunity to be on a flight that was late and missed our connection causing an overnight ... woo hoo ... we got to go to Matt's for breakfast!!! Great service ... spectacular menu ... all the things we like in a place ... AND good coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food. Good drinks - they don't skimp on the booze either, full glass of champers for the mimosa and the Bloody Mary is filled with goodies and a lot of vodka! Not quick though, only stop in when their busy if you've got at least an hour to spare.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, they charge $12 for Maker's Mark on the rocks. I asked for a double and barely got what would be a single pour in any respectable bar in STL. Then after questioning the pour, the server tried to convince me they overpoured the drink. After that I ordered a BLT. Clearly they didn't explain the B in BLT stood for bread. The description in the menu said bacon, lettuce and tomato. Clearly the person in charge of doling out the bacon just got finished pouring the double shots of Maker's Mark. They told us we were getting, and they actually got excited about this, freshly made kettle chips. If they didn't open a bag of Walmart kettle chips and pour them on the plate, then I've clearly never had authentically made kettle chips. The portions are a joke, the prices are high and the servers aren't very personable or accommodating.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best bartender EVER, ANYWHERE!  We arrived in Phoenix in the morning, but my body thought it was lunchtime.  Matt's was not serving lunch yet, but the bartender said  we were welcome to order burgers from next door and bring them over.  He set us up with place settings and drinks and we were happy campers.  One does not expect customer service like this at an airport restaurant - the bartender (geez, I wish I could remember his name) was exemplary.  It was so much fun to watch him work - providing great service to all and doing so with a smile on his face and a serious spring in his step.  I would eat there again in a heartbeat.  Everyone around us was happy with their food, and I must add that the bacon bloody mary looked beyond amazing.  I will have one the next time... for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would highly avoid the Matt's Big Breakfast Takeaway location in the airport. They state it will take only 15 minutes to receive your order. However, it took almost 40 with no customer service apologizing for the wait. I would pick up breakfast else where because their time estimate is unrealistic. I had an hour until my flight boarded and left the food at the restaurant because it still was not ready by the time I needed it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou better have a LOT of time on your hands. Waited 29 minutes for my breakfast sandwich, and the finally asked for my money back. That took an additional 10 minutes, during which time the sandwich still never came out. Finally got my money in time to barely jump on my plane. The best part is on top of everything I was ace to feel as if everything was my fault somehow. Not one \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or anything of the sort. Every single person I encountered including two managers (?) were completely rude. \n\nGreat way to spend my 45 minutes in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey'd rather ignore you than deal with you. Don't go in anywhere close to last call. Rude bartender. Our waitress was nice- her name was Katrina I think? But the lack of communication got in the way of her doing her job. \nI had a \"please just let me give you my money\" smile on my face, but nobody would make eye contact. Bummer. \nAnd dear host- if it's that close to last call, don't encourage people to go in and give it a try... It's embarrassing for me as I sit and wait, and embarrassing for you when I walk out disappointed.\nMy advice- just be nice and be honest!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur flight to Newark was scheduled to leave at 9:45am this morning.  By the time we made it through security, it was 9:20... (I'm one of those people that cuts it a little too close sometimes).  I was starving though, and knew I needed to eat something prior to the five hour flight!  Luckily, Matt's came to the rescue!\n\nI ordered a Sonrisa Burrito to-go.  It comes with eggs, cheese, jalapeno peppers, potatoes, and your choice of bacon or sausage.  I ordered mine with sausage and no potatoes.  It was a generous serving and I actually ended up splitting it with my husband.  We devoured it and agreed that it was delicious.  I would have liked some salsa to go with it though.  Next time, I'll ask for that!\n\nI'm now writing this review on the flight and feeling good after filling my belly... If you find yourself at Sky Harbor anywhere close to Terminal 4 - B gates, Matt's is a great option.  You can eat in or take it to-go.  So glad that we have so many decent options at the PHX airport now!  Bon appetit and safe travels!\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid breakfast!  I've been here four times while waiting for my connecting flights and have always ordered the Matt's Biggest Breakfast - 2 sausage patties, 2 strips of thick-cut bacon, eggs, potatoes and a pancake.  Wow, this meal is solid!  Everything is flavorful and fresh!  They have real maple syrup and ketchup without high fructose corn syrup - another plus!  My husband has ventured to try other menu items and they never disappoint.\n\nThe service has always been great and fast, which is needed, especially in an airport.  I highly recommend a stop here if you happen to find yourself at the Phoenix airport - Gate B!\n\n\n\n\n\nBad service. Bought the food from the cashier. Thought i can sit down to eat. But it's a to go order so they said no you can't sit down to eat even though the restaurant is empty. Sub-standard service.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot recommended in any sense! Matt's Big Breakfast might be the slowest restaurant I've ever experienced. The quality of the food was barely approaching average and the cost was typical of an airport eatery. It was probably half full of customers and they appeared to have a full wait staff on hand. I sat at the bar and saw at least ten plates ready for delivery in the kitchen while the staff just wandered about ignoring it. The only people that appeared mildly interested in working were the cooks and the bartender. That being said my egg and bacon bagel was of the quality typical of a hungover college student. For the amount of time that I waited and the cost I could have left the airport and eaten at an actual restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's in the airport, love it. This was one of our favorite meals in Phoenix and now we can get a taste even when just passing through the city. \n\nGreat food for breakfast or lunch, fun music mix, and nice staff make this a go to spot, especially in an airport!\n\n\n\n\n\nBad Decisions I've Made in 2017:\n\n1. Picking up a skillet fresh out of the oven with my bare hand.\n2. Believing the NY Giants were going to win.\n3. Leaning into the trunk of a cab too early, and gashing my head on the rebounding door.\n\nGood Decisions I've Made in 2017:\n\n1. Getting the Sonrisa Burrito before I got on a plane back to NYC.\n\n(Clearly killing it this year.)\n\nAdmittedly, my Phoenix airport eatery experience is a bit limited, but after drinking liquor of questionable quality until the wee hours of the morning, this burrito quite possibly saved my life. \n\nAlthough the menu only lists bacon and sausage as meat options, chorizo was a nice surprise choice. Beware, it's going to take 15 minutes for this thing because it's real food, and they have to grill the burrito. Which is so, so worth it, even if you have to miss your flight and live in PHX for the rest of your life.\n\nWell, maybe not then.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest breakfast burrito!  Great service from the \"Lisas\".  Good spot to kill some time on a layover.  Seriously, the breakfast burrito is delish.  Grilled with just the right amount of spice. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was great but the pancakes and eggs were cold upon arrival. This was the airport location so maybe there's something to be said for that but the cold food didn't excite my early morning experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have time during your layover for more than grab and go, this is a nice little place to grab some breakfast. I had Matt's Big Breakfast. Three eggs, bacon, sausage, pancake, and potatoes. Everything was delicious! Thanks Matt for allowing me to eat your breakfast!\n\n\n\n\n\n(The opening times on Yelp aren't correct)\n\nDecent burger - decent beer, decent service 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible service at the bar. Understaffed. Decent beer list but overpriced garbage for wine. If you have time, go to Blanco Taco in the A gate area. This place is a joke.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot really sure how this place only has 3 and a half stars. They've got all the hallmarks of a great breakfast place (aside from being in the airport, of course). But Matt's isn't just good for being in the airport; it's good all around. \n\nThe service was spectacular, even the host who had to put up with a lot of attitude from angry people who didn't want to wait for a table. \n\nThe menu prices were decent too, aside from the alcohol of course. But the hog and chick breakfast was $10.99 and comes with all the usual fixings. This is more affordable than most brunch places nowadays, but it was stellar! The toast and bacon were memorable. \n\nNext time I find myself in need of breakfast in the Phoenix airport, I will be headed to Matt's!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat vibe, HUGE portions. Twilight, my server, was professional and really fun. I had the Cheese Omlet and couldn't finish it was so huge. Recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing bacon. Simply superb and unexpected for an airport terminal. Phenomenal. Great price.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food and excellent service!!!  I had the Sonrisa burrito.  I would highly recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheese omelet: Potatoes were very tasty, but greasy (and I'm fine with some grease in my homefries). Good whole grain bread in the toast, but disappointing that there was no butter. Omelet overcooked, but much worse was that the cheddar cheese was chewy & stringy--somehow badly overcooked, which is difficult to do in an omelet. Very slow (albeit friendly) service, too--not good in an airport restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nWish I would have found this place\nyears ago.\n\nYou never know from the store front but if you're looking for a great breakfast, then look no further, Matt's is the place for you.\n\nThe staff at Matt's is accommodating, the food is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable.  The quality of the ingredients  is evident in everybite. Matt's takes breakfast  to a new level. \n\nMatt's big breakfast, is just that, big. Matt's serves classic breakfast food with a  twist of unique combinations.   Today I had salami  and eggs, homestule potatoes, sourdough bread with homemade peach preserves.  All I can say about the peach preserve is it was absolutely delicious and it's made at Matt's daily.\n\nIf your looking for a great breakfast at a reasonable price give Matt's a try.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favorite breakfast spot and the ONLY reason I enjoy not having a direct flight with a layover at PHX airport is this place! They have such healthy and delicious options. Everything is so fresh! Can't wait until my next layover to eat here!\n\n\n\n\n\n10 minute wait for a table. There were 2 of us. They wouldn't separate the 4 top for us and the couple right behind us. Wait, a table for 4 finally arrived. No wait, their table was ready.  No waffles ( or any sweet & savory) and no mushrooms. Antone, who originally took our name, was a pleasure. The gal he was working with (no name tag) actually was yawning while talking to us. Might be a little thing but not a good first impression. We waited 24 minutes for our food and I had to send my pancakes back because they were burned on the bottom. My husband's breakfast burrito was mediocre at best (his words) It was a Sunday morning at 9am.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might have to wait if you visit the downtown location but no wait here. They pour a generous mimosa. Their BLT come on fresh sliced bread, with thick slices of bacon. I like to add avocado. The pancakes are perfect and served with real Vermont syrup. Great place to eat before you get on a long flight.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat, great spot to wait for your plane if you're in Terminal 4. When I went to Phoenix ages ago (and ate carbs with no abandon), this was my favorite place in Phoenix!  Now that I don't enjoy the pancakes or the hash browns, I am still glad to post up at Matt's, enjoy some of their delicious peppered bacon, grab a drink (or a few), have great service, and listen to good music while sitting in an airport.\n\nThanks Matt's!\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty solid cafe in the middle of the PHX airport.  one of the few places they will seat you and bring a menu vs. cafeteria style. decent lunch and bar too.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great find at an airport location . Gone are the egg mcmuffin and breakfast burrito meals. Matts makes everything fresh and quick onsite . Simple fried egg, bacon , cheese and grilled onions on a soft potato roll makes an unbelievably tasty irresistible sandwich all day . I guess airports are improving their food offerings and places like Matt are making it into reality. If you are at Terminal 4 at sky harbor don't miss this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cobb salad used wilted lettuce, and was served minus the bacon. The tuna sandwich was all bread and a pathetic excuse for tasty. \n Matt needs to eat his own food once in while. \nDon't waste your time and go to Wendy's next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was good, phenomenal if you consider the fact it's airport food, and the service was quick, I had mine 10 minutes after I sat down. Toni was very attentive and made sure I had everything I needed when I wanted it. The quality is not quite on par with the downtown location, but it is defiantly above the rest for PHX.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in for drinks and a bite in between flights. Great service, excellent food!! Erika was an amazing bartender/server! Had a tasty breakfast joined by a couple really good Bloody Mary's.  A definite must stop when in terminal 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's infinitesimal breakfast is pricey.  I was not very hungry so I thought I would order an egg and a little sausage with my drink.  What arrived was a tiny little patty of sausage that brought to mind that \"where's the beef\" commercial from the 80s.  The egg was fine and the service reasonable or this would be 1 star .  I feel cheated.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Airport Food in the World!!  They use consciously sourced ingredients like free range meats and eggs.  Amazing comfort food.  Better than home-cooked meals!  Not just breakfast..they have lunch and dinner items too.  If you have some time at Phoenix Airport, this is the only place to eat in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had about an hour layover in Phoenix and decided to stop here for breakfast. There was a decent line of people waiting to be seated, so I thought it must be worth the wait. There wasn't a host/hostess on duty, so people were cutting in line to get seated before others who had been waiting longer. Anyways, I finally sat down and ordered a cheese omelette and added bacon and sausage. The omelette comes out, and it's a little lukewarm. Ok fine. Then a couple bites into the omelette, I see a mushroom. Hmm. Maybe it just snuck in. Nope. I peeled back the omelette and saw a ton of mushrooms. I really dislike mushrooms. If this omelette is supposed to come with mushrooms, list them as an ingredient on the menu! The menu literally said your choice of cheese and that's it. No mention of mushrooms. Unpleasant surprise for sure. The potatoes were cold too. It was a disappointing breakfast to say the least, but the service was good.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is just decent nothing spectacular. My family and I went just recently to the downtown location. My waitress seemed to be in a hurry asking if we're ready to order every 30 seconds. The menu sucks in my opinion not enough options to choose from. Also, from the getgo I told my waitress that I will have my drink with my food(apparently she forgot). Instead of her pouring that out she put it in a refrigerator and then brought me the same glass of Strawberry Lemonade once my food was ready. This is just not the place for me. I went to IHOP and got a better breakfast the next day. With a much cheaper bill. \n\nP. S. Original Breakfast House is much better!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen on a run of DDD joints this week while PHX area.. so caught early breakfast at Matt's BB in sky harbor .. got the big breakfast and while I would not say any one thing was the best I ever had every item on the plate would rank in the top 3.. and everything is fresh homemade .. very unique in an airport. While just like everyone else I could discuss unique homegrown and homemade artisan bacon, one of the best pancakes ever . I have to say I wanted to order more of the breakfast sausage and take it home with me on the plane.. if I had a cooler would have filled it up.  My grandfather would butcher his on pigs. And make his own fresh sausage the flavor and perfect taste I had missed for 50 years. Matt's breakfast sausage was the perfect replica. I will be back ever chance I get when going thru Sky harbor airport .\nMattsBB thanks for taking me back to one of my favorite childhood memories .\n\n\n\n\n\nI usually try and stop in when I am connecting in PHX as their food is pretty darn good. However today the service was extremely SLOW!.  They need to remember people have connecting flights and don't have a lot of time. Took 90 minutes to get in/out today, almost missed my flight. If my flight wasn't delayed I would have missed it. I had to ask for my check 3x.  So if you have less than two hours I wouldn't bother here.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas Eve at 9:50pm and the waitress Corrina was the rudest person I've ever encountered. I'm stunned. I literally left the restaurant because of her. I would have left you a $10 tip for my $12 sandwich Corrina, it is Christmas Eve after all. I'm not a grinch... For the record, she was immediately mean. Even before I could say hello.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really loved this place.  Our waiter was charismatic and attentive and fun!  The decor inside was cute and interesting to look at.  There were tvs to watch news or sports if you wanted.  The wait wasn't too bad-maybe 15 min at most.  The bacon was the best I've had!  My son got the kid's waffle and it was huge!  He ate every bite.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Matt's Big Breakfast so was glad I had enough time to eat before my flight. I ordered the 3 egg omelet. The server asked me if I wanted cheese and if I wanted anything else in the omelet. I ordered provolone mushroom spinach and peppers. The food was good but the surprise was when I got the bill as I was charged for the cheese and the veggies. Did not realize I would be charged as the server made no indication and I did not initially ask for these items until prompted.  Beware.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to go to the Phoenix location for Father's day breakfast. Hubby saw them featured on Triple D.  While yes the wait was long (almost an hour) we felt the food was well worth it.Hubby and I don't like blueberries and I am not a real big fan of eggs, but their blueberry jam is so amazing I wanted to buy some to take home (which you totally can!). They even cooked my eggs the way I wanted (done very well) without me having to send it back to cook longer. The food was so much and so good that we couldn't finish, but we wanted to so badly. Will definitely come here again and wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot impressed. The customer service was awesome and the coffee was hot. Otherwise, this is a no go. Door was expensive and cold. Watched the food sit at the window for 10 minutes before it made it to us. The price to quality ratio is way off. Maybe the main location would be better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just needed to get something to eat before my connecting flight. Lucky to find this place. Good food and really friendly staff. Made me feel like I was at a local hangout.\n\n\n\n\n\nI waited over 30 minutes for my breakfast which is inexcusable for eggs and bacon in general but multiplied in an airport setting. And it's not enough for the host to tell you food will take 20 min. Again it's an airport!!!!  I will stick to Matts on Camelback and explore other options in the airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! Considering this is an airport restaurant, I am very impressed with the quality of food served here. Their breakfast sandwich was flavorful and well worth the $9.00 I spent on the plate. If you are ever in terminal 4 of the Phoenix airport check this place out!\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't even bother if pressed for time...after waiting 25 mins for my \"to-go\" order of one sandwich that never appeared I had to sprint to catch my flight..\n\nbefore ordering at to go counter told hostess flight left in 30 minutes, response food takes 15 minutes tops.  Told me no problem! Ordered a breakfast sandwich and waited, waited, waited... looked like staff moved in slow motion.. asked hostess to check on the food bc i needed to board.  she strolled off to back of kitchen and stood chatting up staff.  I waited for a few minutes and the ran to catch he flight sans food.\nReally shouldn't have a Togo counter..\n\nActually the airport should just get rid of Matt's and replace it with Over Easy - a phx based restaurant that undoubtedly could do a much better job...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standards for an airport restaurant are pretty low. Just some food in a clean place. But don't expect to be greeted nicely...at all. And don't expect an item listed as a \"Tossed Cobb Salad\" to not be tossed, served in a pile with cold fatty bacon, and dressing on the side. \n\nBut the worst part was the amazingly grouchy hostess. Have you seen the Seinfeld episode with the soup Nazi? Picture that. Super rude...lately me rephrase that SUPER RUDE!!! I mentioned it to the waitress who told me that I need to give her a break because it was only her third or fourth day on the job. I thought, are you kidding me? This is how she behaves and she JUST started there? What will her behavior be like after she gets tired of being there.\n\nTo be clear, I was in a really good mood when I got there. I had the perfect amount of time for a layover, had a great flight and a great business trip, I wasn't too concerned about the price as my meals were being covered by my clients. I smiled and tried to be friendly and she was just a grouch. I have no idea what her problem was but projecting it on me was unprofessional and just unkind.\n\nA hostess is \"paid\" to be friendly. That IS their job. To kindly greet guests, warm them up for the waiter, and then find an appropriate seat.\n\nHonestly, the server wasn't much better. She had a \"mildly pissy\" attitude. Not as bad as the other.\n\nI gave this 2 stars and I'm not sure why I even gave that many. I guess 1 1/2 would be appropriate but I'm feeling generous.\n\nI'm pretty sure that the restaurant won't contact me but I wish they would.\n\nIf you're stuck in the airport, try somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst service in any airport. Order a beer and Cobb salad. I was sitting in front of the beer tape.\nStill took her  five minutes after I order the beer. Order a Cobb salad waited  25 minutes and it never came. She forgot to order my salad. Terrible service\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's Biggest Breakfast! \n\nFirst time flying out of this terminal, decided to belly up to the bar here at Matt's. The gentleman beside me had three plates of food in front on him, each looked better than the burrito I was contemplating on the menu. I asked what he was having and learned it was \"Matt's Biggest Breakfast\". I'll have that!\n\nA pile of scrambled real eggs, a huge pancake, fried potatoes, two sausage patties, two really thick slices of bacon with peppered edges, and I added toast. \n\nOh my, that wasn't only the best airport breakfast I've had, but may have been the best breakfast I've had in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose this burger place, and I think that Modern Burger would probably have been a better airport choice.  My burger was overcooked, and it didn't taste good at all, despite all of the bragging about being cooked in butter.  Skip it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered grilled Chicken sandwich with avocado and fries for takeaway. Cashier seem to doesn't care for the customer, she didn't provide napkin in the bag, didn't care to offer for ketchup or anything else. When I asked her about after I opened the box, her response was very casual and didn't care about customer experience. Food quality is medium but the experience is very poor.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Airport Burger  & steak Fries!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what all the hype was about. My server was friendly and cheerful. The dining area was clean, but it was also 7 am so it shouldn't be too dirty. As far as food, eh. \n\nI've been wanting to try the location in downtown but there's always a long wait. So when I saw Matts Big Breakfast at the airport, I had to try it. I definitely will not go to the downtown location now. It's not worth waiting in line or going out of my way. It's great for anyone who wants lots of food for a reasonable price, especially at the airport. But taste wise, you're better off going to Dennys. Meaning, don't come here looking for good tasting food. There are plenty of great local restaurants in terminal 4. \n\nI'm giving this place 3 starts because the service was good, location is good, and the place was clean.\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone says they really like this place. I have to say it was good. Especially for being in the airport it was a nice change from the usual.\nWe had a long flight in front of us so I wanted to eat a real meal. So we went to Matts. We had a small bit of a wait. They were packed very popular place.\nWe were seated and quickly served. Our server was great! She was fast, refilled out drinks and even brought us a to go box. Sorry to say I do not remember her name. as this was before we went on vacation. A lot has happened since then.\nThe food was good but, not great. I got the pancakes that I ordered with my meal when I was almost through with my breakfast.\n I realize they are very busy. It was decent. I would go back. Maybe when I am not so rushed.\nThe price is a bit high I think. But, it is the Airport and rents are high there. \nI will give it a go another time. Coffee was good. Service was great , food was so so.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time checking it out.  Service was friendly and quick.. Wish I could have given more stars but the food wasn't much to write home about.  I didn't have time to alert my server of my disappointment as I needed a quick bite. Was able to pick apart bits I wanted. I paid extra for sausage, and mushrooms... Come to find out, mushrooms are from can?? Why? Never seen so much grease and water pool up on an omlet.  Best part was the side of sourdough bread!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis might be a top 3 breakfast I've ever eaten. Perfect size portions and reasonable prices. The bacon is delicious it's a pepper crusted bacon. The home fries are delicious potatoes with rosemary. The bread that came with it was a sourdough. I couldn't get enough of. Service was great everyone working there was friendly. I will definitely be eating here in my return flight next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood sucked, service sucked.\nOnly one server was nice to us and the one that originally helped us was rude and kept gossiping, using terrible language in front of other customers, and talking about how the other girls working were pissing her off. The food also took forever to come out and it was cold by the time it got to us. Next time I'll play it safe and just do a McDonald's breakfast or something. Do not waste your time or money at this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop notch food and service, done quickly and with a good understanding attitude.\nMy BLT was fresh, with tomatoes that tasted like tomatoes should and fresh crisp lettuce on some great bread. \nMy buddy had a breakfast that was also fresh, plentiful and delicious.\nThere's an amazing amount of good food in the Phoenix airport, yet this stands out for both great food and service.\n\n\n\n\n\nI get paying what the market will bear, the basic economic principal of guns and butter.  But I'm still aggravated when I pay exorbitant prices at the airport and feel slighted, which is all too common.  \n\nNot in this case, Matt's Big Breakfast at the cost of $10.83 (pre tip) delivered a quality meal, good service, and a fair price.  I had the Sonrisa Burrito which satisfied my hunger, and was top shelf quality.  It had plenty of scrumptious bacon, jalapenos, potatoes, and perfectly cooked eggs.  The highlight was the swine, they make mean bacon strips!  Another plus was the side salsa they provided, much better than anything that comes out of a bottle.  I washed my burrito down with a cup of coffee.\n \nThe physical location is open air, bright and friendly.  They also have a big square bar which can seat around 20 people.  I found my way to the sit down counter, where my server was Kristie, she was friendly, but obviously busy.  I never say this, but I was completely satisfied with my bang for the buck!\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast was good but the server was a little much. To each his own but the flamboyant flirting was quite offensive and after years of construction I am hard to offend. Since I was displeased with my service and just wanted to get out of there i opted to leave no tip. Michael our server decided to in a round about way make comments on tips and so on and so on make the experience even more awkward. Like I said food was good but the pet nick names and service made for an overall poor experience. I will stick the the original restaurant from now on.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the waffles which came with a side of bacom strips. The waffle was good and fluffy but the bacon was burned to a crisp. It was dry, overcooked. The service was pretty bad. The waitress was nice though unattentive. I noticed this with the others there as well. And the music? TERRIBLE!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally good breakfasts. Our waiter, Michael was hilarious and upbeat. He made the whole meal fun. The food was very good. I'd eat here if it was outside the airport. It's obviously more expensive than an outside restaurant, but even taking that into consideration, very good food. It cost us about $50 for four to eat breakfast. A normal breakfast enter is too big. It would be safe to order one breakfast and split it.\n\n\n\n\n\nService sucks sooooooo bad. I waited 25 minutes for a bowl of chili? Really? Did they have to hunt a cow? I mean you scoop it in a bowl and you serve it. It should only take 5 minutes but 25 minutes???? I walked out.\n\n\n\n\n\nFoods great. Bartender...not so much. Poor attitude and rude. Stay in the main terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was good. I had mamacito burger and a local beer. There were perfect. The burger is a little bit spicy, but i love spicy food. So no big deal. \nI had coleslaw for the side. I didnt like it i wish i had something else.  \nThe service was a little bit slow for the airport. Others than that were good.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was fast.  Food was terrible. Got the Breakfast Burrito - it smelled weird like it was fished out of a garbage can and tasted like something was rotten inside.  I can't believe I ate even one bite of that thing. I seriously thought I was going to hurl.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came in this restaurant at 5:50 a.m. there was probably five or six people that work here walking around. Every last one of them walk right by me pretty much did not give me eye contact nor even say good morning. One young lady walk right by me and walk to the other side of the restaurant to help someone. It gets so old coming into an establishment to give your hard earned money and just be blatantly ignored. Finally I asked a young Lady,\"hey, can anyone even see me here!!\" The Manager Desi walked by and asked was everything ok, I said absolutely not!! You have 5 people includifee yourself that saw me come in and no one even said good morning!! Not to mention everyone simply ignored me!! I told the manager Desi this is totally unacceptable not to mention I am an Airline employee, also I frequent the first Matt's Big Breakfast downtown for years. Then her attitude changed a little. Truly this is not a good way to start your day or to spend your hard-earned money for breakfast. I could not figure out what was so different about me ...I can only guess!!....after all that I had to ask for water, more Coffee, wow!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't normally think of food at the airport as a great place to have breakfast. However, I have been proved wrong this morning.\n\nWhat a little surprise in the middle of the airport. This place is taking breakfast seriously. I don't feel I am being given sub par food for an exorbitant amount of money. If this was a restaurant anywhere else, I would go back again.\n\nOur servers name was Matthew. Although they are very busy, and I can see why, he is a great waiter and very attentive. Awesome service and a True professional. \n\nI must say that the bacon is awesome. Nice big piece of meat very peppery.  The porkchops were amazing as well. The art of cooking eggs is not over looked here. They know the difference between an over medium and an over easy egg.\n\nWould you like toast with your breakfast, don't expect the generic toast that you get in every restaurant across America. Beautiful thick slices of great read. The sourdough bread was absolutely amazing, and I'm from the San Francisco area.The raspberry preserves were amazing and tasted house made. \n\nMy hats are off to the manager and the staff at this restaurant. Job very well done. We are very pleased!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy second time here today and this place is really exactly what you want in an airport eatery- quick service with a smile. Sat at the bar both times and the bartenders have been attentive and welcoming. \n\nSettled on the omelet last time and this time I went for the burrito sans the jalapeos...since I can be a wimp about that. It comes out looking delicious and tasting the same. It took only 8 minutes for my food to come out too- which is pretty awesome if you ask me. I walk over here from the A gates because I prefer this breakfast to others- it is this specialty after all. Check then out if uou're here in the AM.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've made this mistake twice. First time, it was a rude waiter that rubbed me the wrong way. Second time...25 minutes for an order of oatmeal. The take away counter is chaos. The person working there cannot both take orders and serve food. There's too many people. Chaotic.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time I fly out of phx, I always eat here. It's amazing. Great food and great service. Sit at the bar, Paul the bartender gets you in and out fast.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood place to grab a bite-- not your normal airport grub. Breakfast is Served all day. \n\nI had the \"smothered and covered\"-- chuck steak with mushroom, onions, and mushroom gravy.  very good. The mashed potatoes were better than most steakhouses. \n\nGood TVs around the bar-- an odd music playlist. Drink selection ok. Employees were high energy and pleasant and accommodating. \n\nTypical airport pricing was the only negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food for a reasonable price, especially for airport food.  And the fact that they have some local craft beer only adds. Highly recommend if you are stuck in the Phoenix airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the Rueben w steak fries.  Great corned beef.  Paul the bartender has a great personality and seems to like his job.  Hard to find good peeps behind the bar anymore.   Especially in an airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a layover in the Phoenix airport I decided to stop at Matt's for a drink and quick bite to eat.  After grabbing a seat at the bar it took over 15 minutes for the bartender to address me and provide me with a menu.  After another 10 minutes I was able to order a drink, however, based on how long it took to just order a drink I decided to pass on food, as I was on a layover and needed time to make it to my next flight.\nI received my drink, which had no alcohol, so I addressed in with the waitress, who gave me an attitude.  After that it only went further downhill, leading me to ask for my check and leave.\n\nI can only imagine working in an airpot restaurant may be tough, tired customers, rushed to get drinks and food, etc, but I was none of those.  I only ordered a drink and expressed a concern, especially for the price I was paying and received an attitude.  Definitely not the customer service experience I was hoping for. \nI will definitely pass on Matt's next time I am in the Phoenix airport and visit another patron.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here and just ordered a drink, but the service was so quick and friendly. The staff was very helpful, and all of the people around me who ordered food - it looked delicious. It's hard to find good airport food, but this place uses fresh ingredients and actually seems to care instead of the usual apathetic fare. The lady next to me was being really difficult and making a custom sandwich, and the bartender was so accommodating. Next time I am in terminal 4 gate b I will definitely come back here! My only complaint is I wish they were open longer!\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered the smothered and covered.  The food came out nasty and covered in cold gravy!  WTF!  The food was cold.  The ideas was great, the flavors reminded me of Hamburger Steak with gravy back home in Hawaii.  Also, if you ask for hot sauce, specifically Tabasco, they only have Tapatio!  WTF, cheap hot sauce.  Luckily j brought my own Tabasco sauce to the party!\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployees with attitude. A forgotten order that was then rushed through. Food that was undercooked and unappealing. Told it would be 10 minutes. Found the absent management after 22 minutes. Pointed out to them that 22 was significantly more than 10. If you only have one machine then you probably shouldn't make promises you can't keep. Heard an employee make a rude comment about the  22 minute wait. Avoid, avoid, avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the slowest moving airport restaurant I've ever been too. The employees do not seem to care that there is a line of people waiting to check in as they are standing around joking and laughing. After flagging someone down because we saw an open table we were finally seated 15min later only to be told the kitchen is running 35-40 min late. Under normal circumstances fine, but this is an airport where people need to catch flights. We had to walk out because after the wait for the table, and after the time it would take to order and settle in when we finally would have received our food we would have had to leave to board. They could have told us before we waited for 15 min that the kitchen was behind but they did not.  So now I have two hungry small children unable to eat before a long day of traveling.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood thing we had a long layover..... Potatoes only tasted like rosemary. Bacon wasn't salty but thick. Bread was great. Over easy eggs were dry.   Seating for 2 are so close to your neighbors that I saw a heavy set guy walk away from the place.   Even regular sized customers were way too close together. A shot of Baileys for your coffee was $12.00 and they had no idea what a side of red was..... I don't frequent Phoenix but if I did, I wouldn't go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing service. I got seated pretty quickly and was impressed by how friendly and attentive the staff was (not only to me, but also to the people around me). Food was good, not the best I've had but still pretty good for the price. Would recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nGot the breakfast burrito and it was about 90% potatoes and 10% eggs and bacon. Not very good at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nwe took the red eye flight from Hawaii to Phoenix and needless to say me and my family of 5 were completely exhausted and hungry. fortunately we quickly got a table at Matt's and ordered right away. we didn't even have to wait long for our food and that was awesome because it was a long night and we were completely starving. I ordered the griddle cakes and they were fabulous. light and fluffy and the syrup seemed homemade. all the eggs are from cage less chickens. everything my family ordered look delicious too. would highly recommend this place and I wish they had it back home where I am from.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am an avid visitor at the downtown location, so this visit was very disappointing. I had high hopes at first because they were able to accommodate my request to substitute meat for pancakes at no extra charge, however my dreams were crushed when the food came out less than 5 minutes later. \n\nThe pancakes just weren't good. I've had \"just add water\" box pancakes better than these.\n\nI requested scrambled eggs, but I got a fried egg chopped up. The potatoes were cold and tasted as if they threw some hour-old potatoes on my plate. I love Matt's potatoes, so I know how they should taste. \n\nWhen I told my waiter my issues with the food she took my plate back to the kitchen. Then she returned with the check, expressing how she gave me a 10% discount. I hate ate a few bites of my food, so I was baffled that she was charging me basically full price for a meal I did not eat. I agreed to pay for the pancakes because I ate most of them, but refused to pay for the eggs and potatoes. The manager approached me, and with a not so great attitude told me they weren't going to charge me for the meal. He didn't apologize for the terrible service, but instead acted as if I was just being problematic. \n\nAgain, I love Matt's Big Breakfast, but I will stick with the downtown location and never patronage at the airport location again!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a Matt, and as a breakfast lover this was a slam dunk. \n\nAs far as airport food goes, this is one of the better places I've had and with reasonable prices. I think it was around $9 for the Five Spot Platter and around $8 for the egg salad sandwich. Both were big portions and I distinctly remember the bacon in the Five Spot Platter being extra-large, juicy, and thick. \n\nSometimes, after a long flight you want to get fed and filled up like a dump truck. Matt's will take care of that for you. It was also close to our American Airlines terminal.\n\nAlso, it was open late which is a relief because as it turns out there are a ton of options to eat in this airport but a lot of them aren't open late (11pm or later). \n\nI should also shout-out our waitress. She was an absolute hoot. Being from drought-stricken California, I asked for water tentatively. She responded by ribbing me and saying she would have to check if \"water\" was on the menu. All in good fun and she was super attentive even though Matt's was packed. Must be the whole open-late thing. \n\nVery hefty, very filling, and because everyone says breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I would recommend putting Matt at the top of your list of places to eat in Phoenix's airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix airport spot. Meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy.  Strong showing. Meatloaf was very dense, like it a little more moist typically. Flavor lacked a bit but the extra side of gravy. The Mrs has grilled cheese and tomato soup. Loved it but richhhhh. Best part was our server Dez. She rocked it. Definitely made the meal and the place.\n\n\n\n\n\nI expected the typical airport burrito - big price, small portion. I was glad to be wrong. While the first half was mostly potato, the second half made up for it with egg, cheese, and sausage. Only regret- not getting the salsa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Matt's Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix is much better than the Airport location.  The service at the Downtown location is faster and friendlier, and the portions more generous.  Our bartender/waiter at the airport looked like he hated his life. Never smiled once and wouldn't make eye contact or speak at an audible level when he talked to you... it was actually kind of amusing to my husband and I.  The people sitting next to us were vocal about his poor manners/service, but we just wanted some bacon so we got over it and managed to laugh about it.  I got the Hog and Chick; the potatoes here were not as crispy here, but it's all the same locally sourced ingredients for sure.   (Seemed like it was a smaller kitchen but the restaurant had more seating than other locations, so maybe they were rushing the cook on the food? We waited about 30 minutes for our food from the time  we ordered.) Overall 3 out of 5 as the service had major issues, the dining room was crammed (my legs  and elbows were touching the stranger next to me), but the taste was just as good as the other locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breakfast sandwich was fantastic and a great start to our vacation, but far and away the real star was Michael. He was so energetic,  funny and helpful. I have flown through this airport at least 2x a month for 18 years and he has been the best server I have had. Thanks for truly kicking our vacation off right!\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo airport employees recommended this place. It's the only sit down in the American Airlines terminal, and I was just trying to get my contractions to stop after my mad sprint to my flight after the connecting one was late. I got a meal voucher out of it *le sigh*\n\nI really like that there's outlets pretty much everywhere you sit. That is awesome. Service was fast. I got a honey lemonade... which tasted like.. uhhh.. honey lemonade. It was off, but that's totally my fault.\n\nI got the Sweet and Savory, which was French toast and apple sausage. The entree was no bueno. I am not reviewing to James Beard winner status, but it's a few rungs below IHOP and Denny's. I didn't finish my food, and I'm totally pregnant and exhausted. Something in the execution or the recipe went horribly awry. \n\nFood and drink: $16 something.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chicken sandwich was pretty tasty and a pretty good size for 10 bucks. DON'T get the $3+ coleslaw instead of kettle chips unless you just want thick sliced cabbage drenched in creamy dressing. Should've gotten fries instead!\n\n\n\n\n\nI used to love this place, and actually got a longer lay over today just so I could eat breakfast here. I'm so disappointed,  the service was horrible, you can here the servers talking trash about tube customers. The hottest just screamed out \"we are about to have a fight today\"!\nMy server just served me burnt bacon, Never return things but it was bad, he docent say sorry ,or oh let me fix that, he say snotty, new bacon? , then runs of and brings be barley lest burn bacon, again no apology,  then I see him go talk shit about to the hostis. I'm so sad that this place sucks now it used to be my high light of coming to this airport, and now that I have no reason to come here anymore I will be making my connection thru a different airport all together from now on.\n\nWhat bad service completely , undeserving of a tip at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably my favorite breakfast joint in Phoenix. I love the food so much and the service is great. Also, their coffee is delicious and they are constantly refilling you. Praise. If you want to be seated early, make sure you go early in the AM. Especially on Sunday's, they're normally packed so be there by 8am. Best kn the menu, to me, is the Five Spot, however their pancakes and waffles are KILLER!! Extremely fluffy and made from scratch. You seriously can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Everything is delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nAirport location is not as good as the location downtown.  \n\nThey get really busy here and often have a 15-20+ minute wait.  From this experience I will not return to the airport location again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a decent meal, expensive and service was iffy but it was an airport location so I think that is to be expected.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas sat quickly, table was clean and waitress was quick and friendly. I decided to order the meatloaf because the waitress said it was yummy and she was right! The meatloaf was grilled on both sides to have a crisp carmellization. The mashed potatoes were delicious with a great grace and the side asparagus was perfect! I will definitely be back. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\nMATT'S BIG ATTITUDES! Avoid the bar. There are many other bars in terminal 4 for some reason this bar you are dirt under their feet. Hot beer on tap and cold attitudes.\n\nI travel thru phx airport 42 weeks a year. Eaten here many times. Wasn't till tonight when i met Melissa the bar tender i was compelled to write about it. Avoid her. Mean as s snake.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was like we didn't exist. It took around 10 minutes of standing waiting to be seen. We actually watched people come and go behind us because no one was there to greet us. Eventually, somebody came. \n\nThe first thing that struct me as odd when we finally got seated was that we could not modify ANYTHING\nIf I wanted a waffle on the side, our waiter said I had to buy another full meal that had the waffle. They wouldn't even give my Mother the option of removing her onions from a meal someone said was optional. Very disappointing. \n\nAside from that, the food wasn't bad actually. Up until we noticed my Mother had hair in her potatoes. She was only half way finished her food when we informed our waiter. He said he would take it to his manager and return shortly. So while we wait, I search my food like a madman hoping I don't find anything, resulting in me not even wanting to eat anymore. The waiter returned and said that it wasn't hair, it was only a scratch in the plate. \n\nReally...? A scratch that can move and land on other food with a push of a fork? Right\n\nHe also returned empty handed. If it was just a scratch in the plate, why didn't he give us the food back? My Mom left not only still hungry, but offended as well. The food didn't take too well to our stomachs either...\n\nThank you very much, for being terrible. We will NEVER eat here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Uber driver advised I try this place before I left Phoenix, so I took the recommendation. It was more crowded than I expected but all good places are. I waited for the hostess to take my name down but he kept acting like people weren't standing and staring at him to say hello. After a few times of this a waiter spoke to everyone which saved me from walking away. The hostess still hadn't said a word so I did and just decided to sit at the bar since something was available. I ordered the French Toast an egg and a Mimosa. So GOOD!!! The ladies at the bar were quick and pleasant, made sure everyone was served and would check back frequently. Everyone else and the food made up for the flustered hostess. Glad I got to visit, I'm sure I will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a breakfast place, than learn how to make an omelette !  Mine was dry, like-warm, flat, dense and not presented well either!\nAlso: no cream for coffee! Do you know what that does to coffee? \nDisappointing - for the price you charge, you should do much better !\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time at the airport in Phoenix, and Matt's is a pleasant surprise and great breakfast for airport restaurants. The staff is friendly, and the decor is bright. If you ever are at Terminal 4, great spot for food and drinks. Plus there are many places to recharge your phones and computers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was great! Had a wonderful breakfast. Highly recommend!!!  Organic and local food. Bacon was so thick and well cooked. The whole grain bread was great, with a homemade jelly. I am a picky eater, but this food was quality!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've eaten here about 3-4 times and for whatever reason the staff seems annoyed that they are here, distracted and almost rude. \n\nI've eaten breakfast at Matts downtown PHX and the experience and frankly quality of food is much better. \n\nOrdered Matts Big Breakfast: bacon was cold, sausage was undercooked and the eggs I ordered over medium were also under cooked. \n\nWhole experience was disappointing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for breakfast at any time of the day, look no further. You will be filled up and be leaving satisfied as the portions are indeed as the name indicates: BIG. The quality of the food was perfect. Absolutely no issues and everything was cooked to order. \n\nThe service was AMAZING. If you have a chance, ask for Emily \"Monster.\" She was the most hospitable waitress and had everything to the table promptly and had a smile on her face the entire time.\n\nYou absolutely should eat here if you're at the airport and looking for a quality meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest airport meal ever. Very fresh and flavorful, and reasonably priced.\n\n\n\n\n\nMade the mistake of trying this location after swearing off the original due to the wait times and poor staff. Apparently this location is no better. The wait wasn't bad but the hostess never mentioned the waffle iron is broken today. Only after being seated did I learn the only item I would get from here isn't available today. What a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood service every time.\n\nPaul is great bartender!\n\nAmazing bacon Bloody Mary .\n\nSee you guys next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAte here Fall 2015 and enjoyed it. Would definitely go back if I'm ever at the Phoenix airport again.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur waiter, Michael, was GREAT! He was entertaining and wonderful! My order wasn't 100% correct, but it was super yummy anyway!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy server (Miguel) was super awesome, right on point with everything, quick, friendly, and attentive. I ordered a Fancy Salad. The plate arrived greasy which was weird because a salad with chicken shouldn't be greasy. The manager came out and apologized immediately. They built another fresh salad. \n\nWhile it wasn't a perfect experience, the staff made up for it in friendliness and caring.\n\n\n\n\n\nI stopped in here for dinner on a Sunday night and where the terminal overall was slow, this restaurant was hopping!  Pretty popular place it seems.  I was flying solo and was found a seat quickly when I approached.   \n\nI tell you, the customer service here alone was enough to make me want to go back!  The host and the server were both excellent.  \n\nThe food I had also was spot on!  I had burger with this jalapeno aioli that reminded me of hatch green chilis!! Not sure what they did but man it was so yummy!   I also paid a couple extra bucks and got the steak fries.  Normally not my thing but these came out crispy and were served with an A1 BBQ sauce.   So good together with the burger.\n\nI can't speak to the breakfast as I only had dinner here but I'd be willing to try it out if in Phoenix for breakfast!  \n\nSafe travels!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the way they converted Matt's to an airport concept. Much more successful than the attempt made by Lolo's Chicken & Waffles. For those of you just passing through Sky Harbor, these are both local Phoenix institutions worthy of a try.\n\nI think Matt's effort here is more successful simply because they have their own dining space to manipulate, not a shared space. They use it well. Some tables. Lots of counter space for single travelers. Some communal seating. Lots of outlets. A take away counter. Great breakfast food early in the day and a full bar for later. Or breakfast food later in my case. A lunch menu is available as well. And it's all priced pretty reasonably for an airport. Well done.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best, BLT's I've ever had. Great find in PHX airport. Friendly & fun staff. You have some time to kill, waiting for your flight, then get here.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery disappointed. They're in an airport, and I k JW it's not fast food, but I ordered a waffle. How long does it take to make a waffle. And then they bring me French toast a half hour later. I told them I ordered a waffle and they said it would be a while longer. Can't review the food because I didn't get any. \n\nOn top of that when I sat down the counter was wet and dirty. The staff said they'd wipe it down. It took them 15 minutes before they did that. Poor service.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen early for breakfast. Ordered steak and eggs. Medium well came out bloody and blood on eggs. Server noticed it when he got to table and asked if it was ok? Was not. He took back and made a comment \"our cook is really bad\". After overcooking steak brought back to me with cold eggs still covered in blood. Not my best experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendly staff. Great drinks. Delicious salsa. And most importantly the exquisite ice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food here us pretty good and service is usually friendly. They are slowwwwww. Really not a good trait for an airport restaurant. Only eat here if you have at least 45 mins til boarding.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a layover in Phoenix 6:50 am, decided to get breakfast while waiting for our next flight. Staff was nice and friendly, hubby and I ordered the skinny, thought a nice light breakfast would be good. It was 4 egg whites with gruyere cheese, chicken apple sausage and spinach. What we didn't expect was the spring greens that came with it with a very strong smelling wine vinaigrette. The eggs were practically swimming in it. The eggs had so much cheese in it, the smell of it paired with the vinaigrette was very off putting it turned our stomach so much so early in the morning that we couldn't even think of ordering anything else. Manager apologized and said whatever we can do, we'll do it. We still got charged $10 for a small cup of coffee and small glass of orange juice :(.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I'm flying out of terminal 4 then I'm eating at Matt's Big Breakfast.  Even if my flight is at 10:00 or noon or 2:00.  Even if I have to traipse the rest of the way around the terminal to my Southwest gate, it's worth it to me to get here early and have a delicious breakfast.  They have the best bacon for sure, and the staff has always been fast and friendly.  Maybe someday I'll try something else, but for me the hog and chick is the way to go.  Love everything about this breakfast from the bacon to the roasted potatoes to the homemade raspberry preserves on the fresh baked marble rye toast.    Delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh oj and a great omelette and excellent service! The toast was super fluffy and delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy 5 stars from me.  I travel for work a lot and all my AM trips start at Matt's.  The food is fantastic and comes out fast.  Both the steak and eggs and the Belgian waffle are top notch.  Bacon Bloody Mary is best ever in my book, too.  I've been to every major airport in the US and PHX is my fave.  So much good food here.  Sucks that you have to have a ticket to get in.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place for breakfast at PHX! Service was 5and the food was really good. Wonderful bacon and potatoes. The pancakes were freshly made and super yummy. Our server Michael H. Is great and made us feel like family. Good job!\n\n\n\n\n\nI arrived there at 5:30 this morning for breakfast. After finding a table that wasn't wobbly I ordered the  cheese omelette with mushrooms. It comes with toast and potatoes. The potatoes were undercooked and room temperature. The toast was room temperature and wouldn't even start to melt the butter that was put on it. They brought me a new batch of potatoes and new toast, which I appreciated. It seemed to me that the omelette was not freshly made. I've never tasted one like that before that was freshly made. From the way I was dressed it was obvious I worked at the airport and wasn't just passing through. I probably won't go there again. I am always happy to support local businesses over chain restaurants, but it was a really simple order and most of it went wrong, unfortunately. The waiter, however, was really nice.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy co-worker and I ate here before boarding a flight. \nIt was packed with people and for a good reason. The food was worth the wait and cost. Which really wasn't bad for an airport.\nOur food came out fast and fresh. No waiting for slow service. These people have it together.\nBoth of our dishes were very tasty. We each had Matt's Biggest Breakfast. My eggs were perfect and I'm hard to please. I could have eaten more and wished I did, since it was a wait for dinner as we missed lunch traveling. \nThe coffee was great by the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbience: B-\nCleanliness: B+\nCustomer Service: C\nFood: B-\n\nPrice \n-Its an airport, its expensive, end of story. The prices were very inflated but I have seen worse so there is that.  \n\nAtmosphere\n-Again, its an airport. They try to make it look like an old fashion diner, they fail, but it still beats eating Doritos at your gate. \n\nCustomer Service \n-Its an airport, people are not trying to be there all day. Now I'm not saying the wait staff should put on running sneakers but at least be efficient and by efficient I mean don't be on your phone in view on costumers for several minutes while people are trying to flag you down. On that note, don't look down on your phone while taking someones order and then get annoyed with them when you bring out the wrong order. Unless you were texting the chef, I'm pretty sure it was your lack of listening skills to blame on that one. \n\nFood \nIt was edible. Again, it beats a $6 bag of Doritos. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad, but it served its purpose in that starve to death at the airport. \n\nOverall\nI don't think I've ever had a great experience eating at the airport and this was no different. Usually I get decent costumer service though, so that sort of added insult to injury in this case. If you are going to robe me blind by inflating your prices, at lest do so with a smile on your face.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in 1st time and was very impressed. Seats were open at the bar and we ordered the omlet and BLT. Both came with side of hash browns which were amazing! My omlet was huge and I wish I had ordered cheddar but ordered provalone instead. I could only finish half due to the amount of food. The sourdough toast was awesome as well with the fresh made jam/jelly. Service was great. Highly recommended. They have lunch items as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd time eating here for breakfast. Really like this place. Service is great & solid, fresh food that's made to order. Perfect for when you have to spend a morning at the airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was excellent, the staff knows the menu well and they are all so nice! Wish there was one in Colorado. Loved the waffle and the bacon Bloody Mary.\n\n\n\n\n\nwow! i did not know i could get a great meal, and an attitude change at the airport! my flight was delayed, do i was going to miss my connection.... when i walked into \"Matt's Big Breakfast!\" my server greeted me, like i was his best friend and intuitively knew i needed a BlOODY MARY, with BACON! so now that my mood is getting better, i order an omelet, OMG, this is the best bacon i have ever had! my server was as efficient as he was HILARIOUS! i had heard the rumors about Matt's Big Breakfast, now i am a believer! Michael! ask for MICHAEL!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a great discovery. Breakfast anytime. The 5 step breakfast sandwich was awesome and the happily kept the request for no onions off with a smile. The chili burger was a real life medium like I ordered. I am impressed with any plane that does this let alone a place in the airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest breakfast I've EVER had! At an airport?! It was almost worth missing my next flight. If you have to be stuck in an airport, look for this restaurant!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery disappointed the second time around. Service was awful as in she took my order delivered it and never once came back to see how it turned out. When I was leaving I told her how awful it tasted she said sorry have a great day. My french toast was so undercooked and burnt on the outside I couldn't even finish it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFast friendly service. Thanks Alexa! Food was delicious. Loved the handmade sausage patties.and rosemary potatoes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible service. Their employees are so rude and make you feel like they almost don't want you there. Service was terrible but I don't mind dealing with people like that when I'm on the go. What just made me never want to come back was when I saw the host ask a guy that was sitting at a table to get up and move (mid meal mind you) to another place outside the restaurant because \"he had takeout\" it was from their same place!!!! And there were about 6 other open tables!!!! Are you kidding!!?!? Never coming back! I'd rather get a prepackaged crappy sandwich next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really enjoyed this place, and I find it hard to believe it's in the middle of an airport terminal. The service was great. My boyfriend was crabbier than a crab apple since we missed our connecting flight, but the server was so gracious and understanding. I had the Bloody Mary and wawawewa, it put a lil pep in my step. Definitely one of the best I've ever had, from the garnish to the actual drink. I also had the thick cut bacon. It was sick -- some of the best bacon I've ever had in my life. Grumpopatomus had some kind of meat (pork, I think) smothered in onions and gravy and stuff. He said it was really good.\n\nThe price was a little stiff, but hey, that's airport fare for ya! Cheers!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought the food was very basic. We started out with Mimosas (because hello we were going to Hawaii)... It came out as a full glass of champaign (yes, please) and you got to add orange juice. We got the burrito and Matt's Big Breakfast to share... It cost about 50.00, which I wasn't surprised since we were at the airport. Our waiter was excellent, very very funny guy!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's better than a waffle as a late brunch when you have a layover at 3:00 pm? I don't care where you are in Terminal 4, this place deserves your business. My server was friendly and prompt. The waffle I ordered was hot and delicious. The bacon was crunchy and flavorful. It satisfied my breakfast sugar craving. \n\n4 out of 5 stars, because the food took longer than expected and there were a lot of crumbs and pieces of paper on the floor. The waffle could have been slightly crisper also. Overall, I would go back if I'm in the mood for breakfast food.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice enough server, but evidently there is a condiment shortage: no ranch or bleu cheese dressing, no sour cream. Bread for tuna sandwich looked as if it had the possibility of tasting good but I didn't try it as it seemed to have been left in the arid AZ sun all day today; dry as a bone. Beer good. Glass warm. May be my least favorite airport meal to date.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas waking by and had time to kill. This place was really busy and breakfast before a red eye flight sounded amazing! Say at the bar and Maria A was on point. She was one of the best servers/bartenders I've had. She was manning the bar herself and also helping some other staff. She saw your glass nearing empty before you thought about it. She also kept a smile on her face with every customer encounter. The service definitely enhanced my dining experience. All the plates coming out of the kitchen looked delicious. The Sonrisa Burrito (minus meat) was fantastic. Had great conversations at the bar. Definitely worth stopping in.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt's was the perfect breakfast after a wedding the night before. The food is delicious and high quality. I loved the taste of all of the ingredients. I had the chicken sandwich and the breast meat was juicy, and paired fantastically with the pesto sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\nCould not be better in any way!  Service was very fast and the food is amazing.  The bacon was very thick and fresh, potatoes were perfect and had some fresh rosemary in them. This is the best toast I have ever had, nice and thick with a nice homemade jam.  I hope I'm at the B gates on terminal 4 again soon to get a meal here! So good!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had eaten at MBB downtown once and was a fan of the food they served there. I really am behind the city's initiative to encourage local successful restaurants to open up locations in Sky Harbor airport, and Matt's Big Breakfast is a treat! They also have Lolo's Chicken n' Waffles, Deluxe Burger and Chelsea's Open Kitchen to name a few local fav spots that we frequent in town and at PHX.\nMBB is precisely what it sounds like Big Breakfasts. Keep in mind, it is located at Terminal 4 AFTER YOU CLEAR SECURITY.  Whatever tickles your first meal of the day fancy can be tickled deeply and thoroughly here. The menu is a true journey through morning comfort food presented in more bountiful and gourmet style that your regular combo #6 at your local slop n' drop diner. Last time I ate there before a flight I had a massive omelette with rosemary potatoes (which are amazing btw). My wife had poached eggs and off the bone ham which seemed to have come right from the farm!\nThe only caution I would give is to make sure you have time to have a sit-down-and-order mea. The service is pretty fast but the clients come in waves and everyone seems to need to catch the same flight. l had to chase down our server to run my card as it seemed everyone in the place was trying to pay at once and were likely mostly on the same flight so be sure you're not in a photo-finish situation to your gate.\nFor those in a rush, I think they also have a walk-up counter and sling breakfast sammies to go for those wanting to stink up economy class with their brought-on food...a practice I abhor. I never bring hot food onto a plane. It's rude. Bring a cold sandwich or a salad and leave your stinky McRaunchy's or Blazing burritos in the terminal!\nMBB...come hungry and then enjoy your post breakfast drooling coma as you soar the clear blue skies!\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendly service and fresh food.  Both are usually hard to find at an airport. We enjoyed our breakfast very much.  They make homemade bread.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been to Matt's three time now and the service here is just slow. The food is great when you get it but 15 before anyone even took my order at the bar?!?  I had my water and left.  The bloody Mary's are great and the food is awesome, just make sure you have time and patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered the omelet with 3 cheeses and home style fries. I asked if they could add grilled onions and raw onions and they did!!It was so good. Everything taste so fresh! The people were so friendly and I had the best server, Darnell.\n\n\n\n\n\nAte here during our layover. Usually, I prefer pancakes over waffles, but no protein was offered with the pancakes, so I chose the waffle since it comes with some bacon.\n\nHOLY COW!\n\nI actually set my fork down after the first bite. That was the best waffle I have ever had in my life. I usually don't react to food that way, and I wasn't happy with our somewhat rude waitress, so for the food to turn me around on the place that quickly is impressive, to say the least.\n\nThe waitress is the only reason I took a star away, and I'm willing to accept that we may have just caught her at a bad time. Unfortunately, we don't travel through that airport normally, so I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to go back and give them another shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wish that i just ate at the place all of these good reviews were for. The bloody Mary had no flavor, salt pepper and hot sauce made it ok. The big garnish polished it up a bit, worth $10 airport price at best, not $14.\n\nI had an omelet with mushrooms. The plate was covered in the grease from the omelet, which was overcooked and chewy .The potatoes were both burnt and cold. \n\nThe bartenders treated the patrons like a nuisance. Zero chance of getting a coffee refill. The place was packed when I sat down and emptied out by the time I got my meal. I sat with and empty coffee cup and bloody glass for 15 min until I threw down my card. \n\nI'll skip a meal before I come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Matt (assuming that Matt exists),\n\nThis is not about the food - it was excellent.\n\nThis is not about cleanliness - it was spotless.\n\nThis IS ABOUT ... Alexa, our server.  She was beyond excellent.  Clone her.  Really.\n\nWe arrived on the red eye from Kona.  Good olde American Airlines decided to skip feeding us in First Class, saying that the 5 hour flight allowed insufficient time to serve 12 people the \"Full Breakfast\" that was listed on our itinerary - I kid you not.  Just shut up and each your potato chips.  Coffee?  Cold.  Decaf?  Instant.  First Class, my arse.\n\nWe arrived early, hungry and cranky.  There was a bit of line.  The restaurant seemed packed, yet we were seated immediately.  How'd you DO that?  (By paying attention and sweating the details).  Waters arrived immediately.  Lemon?  Let me get that!  Coffee followed promptly.  Hot coffee, thank you.  We never saw the bottom of our coffee cups.  The breakfast sandwich and breakfast burrito were both excellent.  The portions were generous. Hot food, hot.  Cold food, cold.  The Bloody Mary's ... rock.\n\nAnd ... Alexa also pointed out a virtually hidden AC outlet so that I could (re)charge my phone.  She's an important asset to your success.  Treasure her.  Nurture her.  Reward her.  (No, we are not family.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace was packed on the Tuesday morning I visited. However, we found space at the bar to be serviced immediately. I ordered the salami scramble which came with your choice of toast and breakfast potatoes. Food came out timely and it was very good. Potatoes were my favorite. The jam they provided for the toast was delicious, too. Customer service was great.\n\n\n\n\n\nThoroughly impressed! I've never had an actual \"real meal\" in an airport before. I meant to take a picture of my plate, but I was halfway done with it when I thought about it. This is good, honest food. I just got off a plane from a super early flight and was pretty hungry. I ordered 2 eggs over-easy (which were expertly cooked), rosemary home fries, thick-cut bacon, and really thick rye toast with fresh squeezed OJ. The toast was too thick for my liking because i like to use it to sop up the yolk, but it was accompanied by raspb preserves. left full and walking a little slower. They make everything to order, so don't stop if you're about to jump on a plane, but it's worth the stop if you have the time. The OJ was $5 which seemed pricey to me for what it was. The meal was about $15, but you certainly pay for convenience when in an airport and I didn't have a problem with the price when considering the meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nwe sat at the bar this morning while waiting for a flight and the bartender was phenomenal. \n\nThe food was okay. But as a frequent guest at the other Matt's locations I was disappointed with the quality of the food. \n\nIt just really isn't the same. \n\nBut better than eating at McDonald's so there's that.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place to eat between flights. Was hungry and tried their breakfast and it was amazing!! Definitely coming here again. Super great friendly service makes this a top notch place for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously some of the best meatloaf I've ever had, doesn't even need the gravy. Quick service, strong cocktails, nice spot before boarding.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a fantastic spot to grab a meal. I got the Bloody Mary and meatloaf. Every ingredient in the Bloody Mary was perfect. Extra crispy celery. Briny olives. Crispy thick bacon. YUM. Meatloaf was excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered the cheese omelette and added bacon and onions. It came with potatoes and toast. Maybe just my taste buds but despite the reviews I read, the rosemary seasoning is overwhelming and the potatoes seem undercooked. Looking at empty plates as I left, I see lots of uneaten potatoes so I suggest the chef rethink their recipe. Valentin was my server and he was good and the speed of service was good. The toast is about 1/2 inch thick and more like a dessert; again not my cup of tea but whatever. Crossing this place off my airport stops; will stand in line at Wendy's next time. Sorry!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst airport food ever! Cancelled my salad because there was a roach running across the bar. I got my margarita and there was something floating in it! I wouldn't complain about the glass being dirty and just send it back but that was one to many for me\n\n\n\n\n\nYUM! Great breakfast and service--in an airport?! SO SO good! French toast, sausage, eggs over medium; even their ice tea with fruit infusion is fantastic. Sat at counter: served politely and efficiently. Excellent experience! Matt's and Sky Harbor Airport are recognizing Phoenix and Arizona well. Makin' this home girl proud!!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot the best but not the worst.  I took a seat at the counter since there was a wait for a table and I was a party of one. Bartender/waitress flopped down a menu.  After perusing, I ordered The Hog and Chick, which was basic eggs, meat, potatoes and toast. I asked if I could pay extra to substitute a pancake for the toast.  Waitress gave me a dumbfounded look and said \"yeah, I guess but I don't know how to do that\".  That was the red flag I should have paid attention to. Then she asked, \"sausage, bacon, or ham?\" I picked ham.  Ordered a coffee that came in a tiny cup. They don't have cream, just milk.  Food arrived, decent in taste and usual presentation.  Pancake was small and average.  Here's the kicker...ticket showed pancake substitute was $5! For one pancake.  Ham was an extra $5! (which I just discovered should have only been an extra $1)Tiny coffee that I had to ask for a refill was $3.50. My ticket was $26 for a slightly better breakfast than Dennys! I didn't question it as the waitress didn't seem like one to mess with.   Entertainment was a super flamy and friendly waiter catering to his customers and giving much better service than I had and watching a line cook repeatedly digging out waffles that were stuck in the waffle iron and ripping in half. He used them anyway for the waffle orders to go. Too spendy for what I ordered, probably wouldn't recommend nor return.  The place should be called Matt's Big Ticket Breakfast. Boo.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is extremely hard to find good airport food, especially with great service to boot.  This place had the best breakfast I have ever had in an airport.  Coffee was fabulous.  I have to give a shot out to the incredible service I received from Michael.  He was bullied by a customer and treated horrible, but kept a smile on his face and a spring in his step.  Way to go Michael!\n\n\n\n\n\nKristie is a rock star. The place was packed and she was tending to the long common table. She took care of me and everyone around me like no other server I have experienced in a long time. I work with chefs and travel the country eating in the best restaurants. Take good care of her! The food was really good too. I recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nMatts was recommended to us by some friends who are well familiar with the Phoenix area. apparently they have a few locations. This one is at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport (we were waiting for a flight). If you are at the airport and need a meal, you can't go wrong here. \n\nWe ordered the waffles, and a \"Hog & Chick\" (Two eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes). Fresh OJ to boot. I enjoyed the Hog&chick but the waffles are a better choice. Overall, not the greatest breakfast I have ever had, but for an airport, it's decent.\n\nI have heard that the other locations are better. When I am back in town, I will try them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWaited 30 minutesfor a burrito I had to leave without. Don't advertise a take away counter if you can't get food out in less than half an hour\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendly suggestion. Let folks who buy your to go items sit at a table to eat. Especially if your not busy. After all they paid a premium price for those goodies. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ate one meal meal here passing through at the Sky Harbor Airport.  Of course the restaurant name has \"breakfast\" in it but it was lunch time and I did not want breakfast.  I approached the desk and waited for a few minutes to be acknowledged.  I was seated at the only empty table in the place and wanted to make sure that there were non-breakfast items on the menu.\n\nI decided on the chili cheeseburger with steak fries.  The patty was large which was good for me.  The chili surprised me because it it had beans in it.  I usually eat beef chili with no beans on my burgers.  The burger had good flavor to it as they use butter on the buns.  The fries were very good as I like the steak fries.  Overall the food was good.\n\nIt took a while to get seated but the service was friendly and was a good experience.  I didn't feel super rushed as the food came out fast enough and I had plenty of time to eat with time to spare to board my next flight.  I was definitely full when I left.  This was a three star experience for me.\n\n\n\n\n\ndown-home Southern-style - a cut above for airport food\n\nI had the reuben sandwich with a side of macaroni, with the freshly-squeezed lemonade with honey. The marble rye bread on the sandwich had crust embedded with what tasted like caraway seeds, and was lightly toasted, and fresh-tasting. The pastrami is made in-house, the sign says. The meat was so-so with more fat than I expect, and the sauerkraut lacked flavor. The macaroni salad was really flavorful and I savored each bite. Now the standout for this meal was the lemonade!! I could suck down a gallon and still want more. Ironically, I was trying to avoid excess sugar, and though the sign claims that there's no added sugar, they do add a LOT of honey, which does contain tons of natural sugar, though sugar is sugar, and as addictive as cocaine and heroin, I keep reading in my holistic health blogs. That comes as no surprise. \n\nI'd love to write more, but I am way behind on everything. Anyway, what a buzzkill I can \"bee\". Get the lemonade here, and enjoy life! Airports are really hard to be in, with all the waiting and the loud jarring noises, abominable behaviors right and left, and being WAAAAYYYYY to close for comfort to everyone in all those hellhole godawful tightly crowded stinky nasty airplanes (I don't fly first class - I'm so middle-class I can't bear to part with extra money for a few hours of a little more leg room and I don't need free cheap headache booze and used dirty blankets), so soothe yourself by eating what makes you happy, then exercise like crazy later.\n\nWhat's not clear at all is that if you order at the counter, you take your food to go and you are supposed to eat it elsewhere, like at your gate, not in the restaurant, I later found out. Well, I committed a faux pas, unknowingly, and sat in the restaurant at a table right behind the counter where I placed my order. I apologized to the waiter who came by, and I asked if I should move, but he was gracious, and let me stay. \n\nThe other menu items, like the cheeseburger, looked really tempting. \n\nPeople were enjoying themselves with beers, watching the futbol/soccer highlights reel at the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff was friendly. Food was awful. We ordered The Skinny (4 egg whites w/gruyere cheese and chicken sausage). It was bad enough that there was more cheese than eggs but what made it inedible was that they also put spring greens on the plate covered in a vinaigrette. The smell was absolutely off putting and nauseating. I don't know if it was just the smell of the vinaigrette or it just didn't blend well with the strong gruyere. Either way the smell made It 100% an appetite killer. Other menu items might be very good but I have not tried them. I sent this back and had no appetite for anything else. \nThe manger did remove them from the bill, which is expected since we didn't eat any of it, but still charged us for coffee and a juice ($9.75) even after asking what they could do to make it right. Go figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was fast and good, but that's about it. The chicken Cobb salad was lack luster. The chicken was not fresh. Same with the bacon in the breakfast options. Nothing felt fresh, but all of it was greasy, even the salad! Skip this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have no idea why this place is so popular? How do they have three locations?  These questions boggle my mind.  We ordered the bloody mary after seeing a picture on yelp.  I am always looking for bloodies with fun garnishes.  This one looked fun!  Every garnish was meh.  The cheese seemed like it was going bad, the olives were drying out and the pickle was the worst pickle probably in the history of pickling.  I love pickles! How does one make a mediocre pickle?  I did not think it was possible.  The best garnish was the celery LOL.  Oh, and the bacon was so yuck!  Moving on to the bloody mary.  Nothing special at all.  I ordered a veggie omelette with cheddar.  It was good.  I have had better omelettes.  It wasn't fluffy and the veggies were somewhat greasy.  My sweets had a burger and said it was overcooked and there was nothing special about it.  Like I said, I have no clue what is so special about this place.  All in all don't eat here expecting a fresh over the top delish breakfast.  Expect average truck stop food pretending to be something worth talking about.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnremarkable chicken sandwich served by unenthusiastic wait staff.  Sandwich was supposed to have a pesto taste of which there was none.  Even the addition of the missing romaine lettuce would not have helped flavor wise.  Paid an outrageous $11.50 for a 5 oz. pour of Kim Crawford Sauvignon blanc.  I give it 3 stars because this is my first negative experience here.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery nice food and friendly service. We had the omelette and the french toast. Everything was fantastic! Best food I have ever had at an airport!\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond time I've been the Matt's while traveling and will return again, service staff are absolutely the best, try the grilled cheese and tomato soup and all of the hamburgers are great\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for a tasty Bloody on your way out of town for vacation or a Egg White & Spinach omelet before heading off for a business trip, this place won't disappoint.\n\n\n\n\n\nI normally have enjoyed Matt's Big Breakfast, particularly their coffee. Had time before a flight this morning to grab a cup of coffee after making the trek from gate C. Stood in line at Matt's Takeaway only to be told I could not purchase the plain, black coffee I have always been able to enjoy when sitting down for breakfast at their airport location. This seemed odd to me, so I clarified, receiving the same response without any explanation as to why this was the case. Seems odd to me they can sell only coffee with cream and sugar added. Based off of this, I can't recommend them for an early cup of joe at the airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a surprise to find wonderful food at an airport! The homemade strawberry jam is the best! The sourdough toast is thick and delicious. The staff is great. Cannot day enough good about this place. Will come here anytime I am at Sky Harbor!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I had been wanting to try this place. But, I have always been in such a hurry when I am at the airport I had not had time. The plus side is ,it is inside security so you don't have to worry about getting through Security. Which can always be stressful.\nIt is a very popular place as it is on the low B gates and there is a lot of flights out of that side in the morning. I came here with a friend from Denver after coming in from a flight. So we were not rushed. It is a very clean looking place. A great menu to choose from as well.\n\nI ordered the Steak and Eggs, just a note, they do not do poached. So I got scrambled. It was very good and the steak was cooked just the way I like it. My friend got potatoes ,eggs , and bacon. The food was delicious and cooked just right. It was hot when it came out and it came out fast. The only thing that makes me give it 4 stars instead of 5. Was our server. She never brought us more coffee. \nSeriously we had to ask 2 other servers for more coffee. Which they brought us and with a smile.  Our server Alexa( I think that was her name). Did not seem too happy to be there and did not want us to have more than one cup of coffee. \nThe bright side is, Food is great, place is clean, and most all the other servers are awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\nI know this isn't really a bar but these were absolutely the worst Bloody Mary's I've ever had.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir coffee was bad, the service was slow (they forgot my order) and they don't have half and half! Seriously, it can't be that hard to find a local source for cream.\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing worse then a cook that can't make eggs over-medium. Potatoes were good but the Thick cut bacon is seasoned with way to much pepper.  Nice friendly staff. Will have to try something different.\n\n\n\n\n\nHanging out here before our red eye flight. Cydnie was amazing!!! If you are ever in terminal B, stop in! She's friendly, warm, funny, and kind.  Airports can be nerve wracking but she's such a treasure!  Drinks were great too!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped here because we needed some breakfast to eat. We had been on a 6am flight from Monterey to Phoenix and this one of the places that seemed decent. \n\nThere was a line but it seems that there is always is, however I had to wait 20 min more for my waffle, once I did order, with two strips of bacon. \n\nHonestly it was nothing special, edible, decent, and if you have a lay over and don't mind the wait. Go ahead and stop here. But it's nothing to write home about.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the food tasted OK, it was served completely cold. The server must have gotten distracted because we were one of the first people in the restaurant when it opened early in the morning. We waited longer than we should have for the food to come, while people that came after us we're being served in half the time. Also, we asked if we could substitute one pancake in place of home fries and toast, and we were told that we would have to pay $4.50. Crazy! After flying all night, we were really looking forward to a great breakfast. We would not dine here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nPassed through here with enough time for a sit down lunch...had the Hog and Chick with ham steak (plus an extra ham steak because it is just that good)\n\nIt is honestly almost coming to the Phoenix airport just to hit Matts.  I don't like potatoes usually but I will clean the plate with Matts potatoes, just the right amount of fresh rosemary and onion.  Great sourdough toast, delicious raspberry jam.  \n\nAnd the ham!   Just please do yourself a favor and get the ham.  This is what you think about when you think ham, salty, smoky, crisp and soft all at the same time.  Can't wait to fly through terminal four again.\n\n\n\n\n\nColor me shocked. I didn't have high expectations for a place in an airport, now I feel like airports are going to be held to a whole new standard. I opted for a Bloody Mary - which hands down is one of the best I have ever had. A small meal in itself. I also went for an omelette with a side of potatoes. Those potatoes, so delicious. Well seasoned with rosemary, crispy on the outside, and perfectly soft on the inside. Paul was an amazing bartender. Hope my flights are all out of this terminal whenever I am in AZ!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad an extended layover in PHX airport and decided to try this place out. I had forgotten that Guy Fieri highlighted the downtown spot on DDD.\n\nLocal coffee served from Roastery of Cave Creek. The panda needed that caffeine.\n\nFive Spot Platter ($8.95): Breakfast sandwich with bacon, American cheese, two eggs, and grilled onions. Potatoes on the side. The roll is large, with a small layer of filler. On the plus side, the roll was soft and fluffy. The roll's flavor reminded me of a croissant. The potatoes were seasoned generously with salt and pepper. Bacon was excellent. Good portion. Overall, I'd say The Five Spot hit the spot.\n\nI just sat at the bar for this one. Good service.\n\nI saw others at the bar ordering Reubens. Hefty sandwiches that are recommended by the staff if you want a nice-sized lunch.\n\nI'll have to remember this place next time, should I opt for a very gluttonous meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is very good but the wait is long at certain times of the day. Still worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in with my wife for breakfast before boarding our flight. It's a small place so expect to wait sometimes when they are busy about 30 min. So I recommend planning ahead to arrive at the airport early so you get to try this amazing food.\n\nThe pancake was amazing nice and fluffy with just the right amount of very subtle crispiness. What else can I say about BACON!!! BACON ROCKS and the bacon here is a little thick, crispy, and very tasty! The home fries are seasoned and cooked with friend onions so if you don't like onions might want to let them know. \n\nOur server was Tim and he was AWESOME. Great personality, friendly, and just a cool guy.\n\nHighly recommend visiting this great place!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis brunch spot is a MUST go-to either here or their location closer to downtown! I was pretty happy being able to start and end our trip here in Phoenix with Matt's. It's a great Phoenix staple!\n\nFirst things first, service here is FAST which is very appreciative especially at an airport. They have portable credit card machines they will bring to your table after your meal to pay so three people could pay at once without having waiters scrambling around the small space to run your card, run back to you, then run back to the table to pick up the tip receipt.\n\nWe got sat right next to the waiter station and our waiter was very attentive and fast. I got the chop and chick this time because I really liked the pieces of pork chop I stole from my boyfriend last time ... :P and he got the breakfast sandwich. Instead of the lemonades, he got a bloody mary and I got a mimosa in a stemless wine glass.  \n\nI would say quality, service, and prices are the same at both locations we went to. This would probably be the definition of a good restaurant to try out at the airport here.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I had the pleasure of eating at both locations while in PHX and this one out did the original!  I had this gin, lemon and soda water drink which solved my pissy attitude towards the airport :).  For food I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added bacon to the grilled cheese.  They had awesome buttery bread and the soup was nice and thick.  Every employee seemed like they were having a great day which helped as many of us were grumpy from canceled and delayed flight.  Prices were good so I strongly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nAirport restaurants and bars are almost always going to be lesser than their counterparts. You're naturally going to get bottom of the barrel employees. Ones that can't get the same job outside of the airport. \n\nBut, this place is especially bad. I'm an okay cook. Maybe pretty good. But not great. I could make better food than this place all day. It's terrible. If you need to eat a meal, it will do the job. But that's it. For example, the burger is really just pathetic. It's a very low quality ground meat. I mean something you wouldn't even see available at the grocery store. The bun overwhelms the meat because the burger itself cooks to a withering lump. Everything they put on the side to load the burger is equally unsatisfying. Nobody cares about the price in an airport. You have a captive group of buyers. Make good food. \n\nService is sub par but nothing unusual for an airport. Just your typical waiting too long for everything even though you're obviously waiting to catch a flight. When I'm flashing my credit card though, let's get the transaction done. Don't walk away telling me my receipt is in the cup next to me. When is the last time somebody looked at a receipt in a restaurant. Just pay me out.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy hello hashbrowns smothered in rosemary!\n\nStopped by here for a quick bite before my connecting flight and I literally fell in love with the potatoes. The coffee was strong and good but they don't offer cream and this girl likes fat in her coffee so thumbs down to that. Come for the food, not a service filled experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nI fly a lot from the Phoenix airport and always come here for the awesome food. Today I decided to try the chili for the first time. It was cold! I sent it back and it returned lukewarm. I ate it because I was hungry, but was incredibly disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was great! First time trying out their breakfast food here. I got \"The Hog and Chick\" and it was fantastic & delicious! It was so packed when we got there and right when we sat down, it slowed down. Service was good even though she needed to smile more lol but it's fine. The food came at the expected time which is great. I liked it!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware food may be unsafe!!  Three of us ate here yesterday.   Service was fine, but we were sick all last night and today.  100+ temperatures.  Clearly food poisoning.  They should have their cleanliness and food preparation checked.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally wish I could give this 3.5 stars, but system won't let me.  Ate here last week while on a layover.  Could not pass up trying the Bloody Mary (even though I don't actually like vodka) once I saw the bacon!  The cheese was a little weird, not gonna lie.  Also had the enormous Reuben sandwich, which was really delicious.  Service was great, friendly, food was plentiful, and the atmosphere was comforting.  Would definitely eat here again if given the chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the breakfast sausage burrito, spicy, meaty, and hit the spot. Service at the bar was a little slow but good server was very friendly. \nCoffee was better then the Starbucks 3 gates down\n\nTv's at the bar, NHRA on a Sunday morning\n\n\n\n\n\nI know better than to have high expectations when going to airport bars and was having a great time at this place. But then the bartender, Lisa was a little rude. First she rolls her eyes at me when I tell her there's an error in the check as she charged me for a more expensive vodka and I guess it was to much trouble for her to change it as she tried to downplay the error saying they were the same price when they are not. Then after I gave her what I understand is the usual $1 per (airport overpriced) drink tip, she starts acting up and being sarcastic about her service not been good and that we should let her know what she did wrong so that she can get better because we gave her such a bad tip. I honestly never had a waitress or bartender ever give me crap about my tip before I even leave the place. What a shame.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest breakfast I've had at a airport hands down, \nGood size portions and very good. Had ham and cheese omelet with fried potatoes and they actually had seasoning fried with them and onions\nWas good stuff, Price was very fair for a airport\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick eat and beverage.  I order the Cobb salad which was subpar.  It was tossed in balsamic which I have never seen before. A lot of the sale was wilted and brown and it was lacking the key ingredients of protein.\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer, thank you for your great attitude today; you were genuinely very sweet and gave stellar service to me and the folks at my tall table.  You were very attentive, and went above and beyond to give us what we wanted.  The lady next to me did not like bacon that is not super crispy. You saw she did not eat it and came right back with some lean, crispy pieces. She took my silverware :)  The gentlemen next to me asked for a drink which Matt's serves on ice which he is not used to. You quickly apologized and wanted to make it right.  Matt, you need to give her a raise to keep her on staff; folks like Jennifer are rare and you cannot afford to lose valuable employees like her.   This is a great spot if you are sick of standardized chain food in airports looking to serve shareholders rather than customers BTW.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid breakfast/brunch choice if you're at Sky Harbor. Waffles and Nueske's bacon were very good, my husband's Hog + Chick (eggs/bacon/toast/potatoes) was standard, and they kept the coffee coming. Friendly service.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered the BBQ chicken dinner and got a tiny piece of chicken that was totally dry. The waiter was embarrassed and gave me another piece so I gave this place two stars instead of one. Five stars for my waiter zero stars for the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to our wonderful waiter Michael, My fellow traveling companions and I had a great time. We had awesome food, that was well cooked and the honey lemonade tea was amazing. Thank you for your fun filled service, in the words of Michael \"A smile makes all the difference, and it's free.\" Just what we needed this morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant/bar at Sky Harbor, Terminal 4 is decent. The menu is diverse, the staff was extremely friendly and the food was tasty. The prices were great - and the portions were ample.\n\nYou may have to wait for a seat, but usually the wait isn't long.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating is because my potatoes/home fries were cold. The sandwich I ordered and my wife's food was perfect.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to family and friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am seriously shocked at any good review for this restaurant. I ate breakfast here this morning, and it was the worst breakfast I've had... Maybe ever? The home fries that some people rave about were soggy, greasy and heavily over flavored with rosemary, not to mention Luke warm. The bacon was inedible salty. The toast came out with enough butter for a whole loaf of bread. The over easy eggs were actually fine, thus one star. The waitress never asked why I left all of my home fries uneaten, not a sign of good service. Expensive and NOT worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice surprise for airport food. Had breakfast with a few people and everything was very good. Food was hot freshly made and tasty. Fast service and even though there was a line to get in it moved fast. Staff was friendly and hustled to get you on your way. If you in the airport and hungry I. Would recommend you try it. I will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a quick breakfast here between flights. Waited a few minutes for a table, and later my server explained that they were without a host that day. I tried the breakfast burrito with chorizo. Fat and delicious! The hot salsa served in the side was great. Service was quick and super friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat breakfast spot. This one was at the airport. Service was good along with the food. Decent size portions. Had the mimosas which overall weren't bad but way too pulpy for my liking. Other than that, it's a great little spot at the airport for breakfast food.\n\n\n\n\n\nAirport food. Let's keep it simple. The greeter was super nice. The server was super nice. The bartender was super nice. The food came out fast hot. The drinks came out quick and were delicious. And the food....probably some of the best airport food I have ever had. Better than some regular restaurants. And I always expect less of airport food. I was pleasantly surprised. I travel through Phoenix often...will definitely stop by here if I have time. And so should you . ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nYet another lay over!  Luckily Matt's Big Breakfast is very close to my terminal.  I was famished, the bartender waitress recommended the The Five Spot...and it certainly hit all of my five spots...taste bud spots that is!  This dish consists of Breakfast sandwich on a roll with 2 eggs, two slices of thick-cut bacon, American cheese and grilled onions, with a side of home fries...my only qualm would be the rosemary that they added.  I was devouring it in such a graceful manner...yeah right...that the lady next to me just had to order it, she loved it as well!  I will surely be back on another lay over!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was ok. However the waitress Erika was very rude. After being ignored by the hostess, I finally sat at the counter. Then I was ignored by the waitress Erika at the bar. She seem not to ignore the people beside me. Once I said excuse me can I order? she acted like I was bothering her for asking. When i finally got my order the other waitress threw my meal to go on the counter and said Erika will get you your ketchup.  No thank you, no have a nice day. I travel a lot for a living, especially to Phoenix, but I promise I will never go to this restaurant as long is this is the type of service they provide.  If you get hungry, I would suggest you eat somewhere else. No food is good enough to put up with bad service. I did tip her, because I truly believe in tipping your server, even if the service is not up to mediocre standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have to give it four stars because there is nothing else like it at the airport.  Very, very trendy.  Good service.  Reasonable prices.  Delish food.  I had the traditional egg, etc breakfast and the only thing traditional were the eggs.  Toast was presented in a fun way and tasted great.  Definitely high quality bacon but maybe too much pepper on the edge.  Orange juice tasted freshly squeezed.  Potatoes were yummy.  Next time I'm going to try one of the waffles.  This part might surprise you...I wasn't departing or waiting...I just landed at 9pm and saw it on the way to exiting the airport and knew that it was going to be a better meal than fast food on the way home. Go Matt.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooked up great breakfast places in Phx. We checked out Matts. Worth the hype. The Belgian waffle with thick cut bacon. Oh that bacon! Cheddar omlette with roasted peppers and More bacon. Perfectly cooked rosemary onion house fries. The strawberry jam was just right. The staff was super nice and brought our food out in five minutes. Delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\nBest breakfast ever.  Matts never lets me down.  Amazing pork chop breakfast. Perfectly prepared. Great 1 inch thick sourdough toast. Fresh squeezed OJ.  Nice people. Great bar. \n\nGreat surprise at a major airport!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was here for breakfast and ordered French toast with bacon (burnt) (deduct a star) I suggest stopping here ONLY if you have a ton of time to kill - kitchen takes an unusually long time to get food out (deduct a star) coupled with poor service (deduct another star).\n\n\n\n\n\nI reached out to management via their website\nto point out a problem I had at PHX airport B terminal location. They seemed concerned and interested in my input. Then I got a message\ntelling me to call them 5 days later. It makes sence they would contact me and ask for a good tome to call ME. I'm a customer trying to voice a\nlegitimate concern. I told them i would still try it again and report back to them. I never heard back. I dont think they realize frequent flyers like me try to find good reliable places to eat and become regulars. I even offered to come back\nagain! And let them know how it went. But by not\nbothering to contact me again shows they dont care. They must figure most people will come in only once. No interest in cultivating a reliable consistent customer base means they will miss out on alot of revenue. Most people do NOT\nbother to write reviews. They just dont go back.\nBTW the reason i contacted them was that my big beautiful salad had all white chopped up romaine lettuce. They use very low grade romaine. And then try to hide it by chopping up the white lower part of romaine heads. I assumed they got the white super finely chopped by mistake from thier produce purveyor. And simply wanted to point it out. But their decision to not follow up tells me the very low quality romaine is the norm.\nThis restraunt is designed for tourists I'm guessing. One time only customers. To bad\nthey dont care. I could have been a regular\ncustomer as i fly through PHX 4 times a month.\nKeep it up and you will close in 18-24 mo.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe purchased two \"Classic Ruben\" sandwiches on the 16th of November 2015 for take-out. Sorry I do not have photos, but my wife gave the second sandwich to the American Airlines stewardess as trash before I could get photos.  What to notice first - despite having many small sealed bags of \"chips,\" Matt's tossed a handful of loose chips in with the sandwich. An hour into our flight, they were all soggy, having lost all crispness. Matt's saved a few cents by dumping in their bulk chips. Shame! Matt's sandwich was premium-priced at about $11.  An excellent Reuben outside the Sky Harbor is in the $6-10 range.  A $11 Ruben should be amazing.  I doubt anyone at this Matt's has ever seen or had a Classic Ruben.  Matt's used bread that was sliced into extra thick 1\" thick slabs.  If it was \"rye,\" the grain was a minority contributor.  The sandwich was cut into two rectangles, like a grade school peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Classic Rubens are cut on a diagonal!  The corned-beef was tough and the quantity very small.  You could hardly taste any sauerkraut or Russian dressing.  Sky Harbor diners from the \"coasts\" should stay away from this atrocity to avoid disappointment. However, we give credit to the \"grill-man\" for getting nice \"grill-marks\" on the bread!\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere was welcoming and food was good. But the servers dress was inappropriate for a breakfast place if I wanted to see that much skin I would have gone to Hooters at least there they don't look like they just got out of bed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey make an awesome Cobb salad here with really thick bacon. I also tried a Bloody Mary to enjoy the thick bacon again and it was awesome round 2!\n\nI will definitely stop back here next time in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n\n\nTERRIBLE. Ordered a waffle to go, was told \"couple of minutes\", ended up waiting for over 20 minutes, and waffle was burnt. Forgot my coffee, too. Never ever will return.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey only serve whole milk with coffee. You ask for cream but they don't carry it. They won't poacher eggs, my eggs were not cooked thoroughly even though I asked for over easy. My has been asked for a little bit of maple syrup with his waffle and I told him it would cost $1.69 more because it's pure maple sera up. Won't be back again and we fly frequently. Took over 35 minutes just to get our breakfast this morning on Saturday at 8 AM.\n\n\n\n\n\nLayover in Phoenix and this looked like the best option outside of burgers, Mexican and fast food chains. In B gate area. \nGot the chicken pesto sandwich on wheat. Nice bread and large chicken breast that was cooked perfectly. Upgraded from chips to home fries and it was well worth it. No Coke, just Pepsi. Friendly service, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nI almost like this better than the downtown location just based on size alone. But both locations tend to execute quickly and provide tasty food. They also have the best bacon, most deliciously seasoned potatoes, and garagantuously trimmed $14 bacon Bloody Mary's (for airport food, I'll take it). Their sourdough toast with housemade jam is also not to be missed.\n\nWorth the treck to the B gates if you have the time before takeoff.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast is always good here, but tonight I tried the BLT with fries.  Lots of crisp, thick bacon on toasted bread.  Fries were also good, and the service excellent.  Spend the extra for the orange juice.\n\n\n\n\n\nI panned this restaurant's original downtown Phoenix location a long time ago, but their Sky Harbor Terminal 4B location has made me a believer. Matt's now makes the BEST STEAK & EGGS in the state! Yummy thick bacon made with brown sugar and fresh artisan breads.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo preface this: I actually really enjoy Matt's Big Breakfast - the food tends to be great quality, and service is fine. I just do not like the customer service at THIS Matt's (at the airport).\n\nTl;dr - poor customer service will cost you (both reputation and cash).\n\nMy wife and I gave our name to the host (who was this older, very curt fellow) and moved about 4 feet away from the entrance to make space for others to pass through and/or add themselves to the waiting list. The host told us it would be about 15-20 minutes but hopefully faster.\n\nMy wife and I then started having a conversation off to the side while still listening for our name to be called. Meanwhile there was a really outgoing waiter who was very personable serving people just on the other side of the barrier we were standing by.\n\nAs we are standing there, I spot about 5 groups get called in, so I figure we are getting close. It's been about 12 minutes at this point. I go to check the list, and there's a lot more names crossed off the list AFTER us. I mean about 15 names scratched off AFTER us. No way we heard him call that many names for people. It honestly just looked like he was arbitrarily crossing people off the list. And indeed our name was crossed off, but I decided to double check with him anyway.\n\nI ask the host if he called our name (I swear he did not), and he said he did but we did not respond. His tone was incredibly rude, too - like he was gloating about it. We were literally 4 feet from his stand. What?\n\nAt this point, I realize it might have been possible that we missed our name being called as the outgoing waiter was really loud, but please, if you see us 4 feet away, just call it again to make sure. Better yet - switch the host and the waiter. No way would we have missed his call. The original host was mumbling by comparison, and he looked like he hated being a host.\n\nThe best the host offered was to put us back on the list, but at that point, I had no faith in his ability to be courteous or to call our names when our turn was up, so we just left. Your time is better spent at an establishment that will at least try (and not just rest on the laurels of being a known restaurant).\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty basic airport food. I was expecting a little better based on the look and design of the place. I got the breakfast burritos and it was cold (which was surprising because it came out very fast), the sausage seemed undercooked and my eggs were a weird grey color.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorse Cobb salad ever for me! Nothing but blue cheese and romaine lettuce. Also ordered gin and tonic but was served premium without being asked in a tall glass. So not worth the $26.00.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has the worst oatmeal in the airport--no fruit, no nuts and a meagre amount of raisins and their oatmeal costs $1 more than anywhere else in the entire airport.  Better to get your oatmeal from La Madeleine, Starbucks, or Wildflower--all with fresh fruit and nuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent the night in the terminal between flights and saw Matt's. It looked like a good place for a real breakfast so we were looking forward to it.  The wiat satff was very good. I think our waitress was named Maura or something similar. And the table near us enjoyed a lively, funny chat with their waiter.  The bacon was great -- it seems to be one of their trademarks. My Belgian waffle was good, just what I wanted, but nothing spectacular. My wife had french toast and was disappointed. It seemed like it had just been passed through the egg soaker and wasn't nearly rich or eggy. Tea was hot. Service was quick and attentive. Price was fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food! It not as good as the original, but it's great to have some local food in the airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG...what a fun place to eat breakfast. A rainbow cast serves up some pretty good breakfast. The place put a smile on my face.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food!! Everything tastes great and was truly fresh as advertised. I got here early enough to not have to brave the long line out front (although knowing what I know now I would have happily done it). The eggs were fresh, the bacon looked and tasted like real bacon, the waffle was fluffy and delicious and the orange juice which came out of a gigantic plastic jar I'm sure was squeezed that morning. A+\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick stop for breakfast on my trip home! Very busy but still got quick service! I ordered eggs, bacon & toast. Everything tasted great and I'm definitely adding it to my list of approved travel spots! The fresh jam was my absolute favorite!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeer, bourbon and a side of bacon.\nThats what I had here before my flight. Ron Swanson would be proud of me.\nGreat place to catch a buzz before you get on a plane!!\nLove that they have Goose Island on tap along with local beer!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe staff was nice enough ... offered me soda water v Diet Dr. Pepper which they don't have. They offered me jalapeos and guacamole on my chili. All very nice. When I got my bill, I found that they charged me $3.59 for soda water and $5 for jalapeos and guacamole. I have no issue paying ... I just would have appreciated a heads up that they were about to rip me off. \n\nIf you don't like nasty surprises, don't eat here. Buyer beware!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWay less of a wait here than at the original, well semi-original anyways.  If you worked at sky harbor that could be considered a perk all by itself.\n\nQuality was just as good as downtown. Service was very quick.  I didn't notice if they offer their lemonades here but you could have a brew with your hog and chick and that's not a bad way to start the day.  Not having to wait a couple of hours (no exaggeration, if you've been to Matts you know) doesn't detract from the food at all.  The ham steak is still the star of the show for me, it's just as good here which really is a great surprise.\n\nThe airport has really stepped up its game when it comes to dining, I hope I fly out of terminal four more often.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as wonderful as the downtown location.  Even one more advantage is they have French toast on their regular menu and it is a special at the downtown location.  I ordered it this morning and amazing as always!  They opened up around 5;40 am and I was able to order and eat and be done by 6am to make my 6:30 flight.  Great service too!\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably the best breakfast I've had at an airport! The seating was pretty tight but you can't expect much at an airport restaurant. I ordered the cheese omelet with potatoes and sourdough toast with the strawberry preserves. Everything was great quality and for a reasonable price when compared to other airport restaurant prices. Friendly wait staff as well. Would definitely recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent service but they downsized all their beers.  They are putting the beer in small 13 oz glasses now.   And they are still $8.50 each.   Other bars in the airport still serve 16/20 oz.   I would choose another place.\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG!!! Talk about awesome and great food in an airport!! Loved the French Toast, thick peppered bacon and sausage and the syrup was AWESOME!! I don't usually rave about syrup but I found myself dipping every thing in it. My server was Mauren and she couldn't have been friendlier or quicker. Only thing I wish was they served my Diet Coke. But after that meal I can't complain.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW! I WASN'T Expecting my flight to leave so soon! I had already ordered my food and they had served my friend and I a cup of soda . I got curious and checked the time we were suppose to go on the plain. We had 8 minutes to board! The employees understood out situation and didn't give us a hard time! Next time I'm here I will thank them personally! Sorry guys!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is right by terminal 4 in PHX and one of the better places that I saw when I was walking down towards the baggage claim. \n\nTheir food takes a while to come out- it was a out 15 to 20 minutes on a Thursday at around 11:45am. Though it takes a while, it's because their food is handmade and boy, it's quite busy. \n\nThere aren't a lot of well-known food places in that terminal, so I'd definitely suggest this place. They also have a few breakfast food that you can order all day!\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible, horrible service. I am a big fan of the original Matt's, but this is a poor set up for an airport. When you order to-go food, they ask your name (sometimes) and then sometimes call out names or the type of food it is. I waited 25 minutes for my breakfast burrito (first off, who has that much time in an airport) to then be told it wasn't mine because she took my name. So I waited and waited. And no one took the burrito. So I went back to ask nicely if perhaps that was mine and she yelled at me and told me now. I waited and waited again (now the burrito is cold) and asked if it was possible she forgot to type in my name. She angrily grabbed my receipt and checked the times. \"Oh I guess it's yours, sorry\". So now I've paid $10 for a cold burrito that i waited 35 minutes for. No thanks. Will never come again.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery other restaraunt in an airport will get you your food before 30 minutes,  it's not even busy, wtf.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was ok. I had a ham and cheese omelette ham was good home fries need work. Wife got a salad that only had a balsamic vinaigrette which she didn't are for. But mimosas where flowing well we had time to kill at about $9 a piece they added up and they conveniently didn't place prices on the menu of alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimal wait time, wonderful food which was completely unexpected for airport food and our server Michael was absolutely amazing!  The rosemary on the breakfast potatoes is top notch!  Can't say enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing organic local food small business ! They have the same prices as the place they have in town. Hogs and chicks are awesome with peppered bacon the sausage is amazing too. If you order with someone else get one of each so you can share and get both. By far the best dining experience I have had at an airport . Our waiter TIM was outstanding and a great asset to Matt's Big Breakfast! Way to go Phoenix AirPort for allowing local business!! If you go here comment and tell me what you think. Oh ya cheap too $\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the meatloaf and Elizabeth is the best. I comeback every week and she makes me feel like part of the family.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally made it to Matt's.  Sat for ten minutes with four workers walking right past us not even acknowledging our existence.  Not even a glass of water! Portions were tiny!! and tasteless.  Definitely did not live up to the hype!\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast is yummy. Champagne mimosas are great. Atmosphere is fun obviously because it's an airport. Issue with your classes not good. You order a Pilsner or you get it in early girl glass not in a pint glass. And you can't change it? \nWhy does the stone IPAA come in this  little goblet? \nThe waitress tried to explain it but we still don't get it? Can  someone respond to me please? Just odd.

Awesome food. Service is very good. Make a reservation because its so busy the wait and be long....but so worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting family in Arizona and decided to stop here. Great choice the margaritas were delicious!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm reluctant to post this review because I'd hate to see this place get too popular.  It's perfect the way it is.  We ate here again last night - that makes three or four times for me and several more for others in my family.  It is outstanding and the prices are very reasonable.  I always order the fish tacos (delicious but messy) - other popular entrees in my family include the carne asada and el bombero (also beef).  The margaritas are also wonderful (and enormous).  Highly recommend this place, but sure hope it stays the way it is.\n\n\n\n\n\nMY absolute favorite Mexican restaurant!  They have 2 locations... 1 at Litchfield and Bell, and this one in El Mirage off Grand Ave.  I like both, but LOVE the Grand Ave original location.  On Sundays they have the annoying mariachi man thou.  ;/  LOL\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon arriving, we stood at the host stand looking for someone to seat us since there was a sign that said \"please wait to be seated\". It took forever for someone to come to the front even though we could see into the kitchen and the staff was just standing back there chatting. After finally getting sat, our waitress came and had a bad attitude. She looked like she would rather be anywhere but there and she never smiled and was just unpleasant. I think her name Adriana or something like that? If you can't be somewhat friendly, and think customer service means being snappy, then you're in the wrong line of work.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here and it won't be my last.  Outstanding service and great food.  Wonderful atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Mexican food!! We had Mother's Day brunch here and the food was amazing. We will continue to come back for the great food and service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! This place is goooooood. When we got there they said there would be a 40 minute wait, but we were seated within 15. I can see why they were so busy! I had the combo with the green corn tamale and chile relleno with a side of flour tortillas. My fianc had the spinach enchiladas. The flour tortillas were being handmade in a corner of the restaurant and omg they were delicious. The chile relleno was super flavorful but the breading was a little thin. The tamale was so good! It was full of corn and cheese. The spinach enchiladas were different but they were very tasty. They had a red sauce on them and not a ton of cheese, but they were very flavorful. The margarita was very good, not too sweet. Our total bill for two entrees, a margarita and a beer was 29 and change. They also had a mariachi band playing which was fun. Love this place so much!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally enjoyed the food here. We recently moved to the southwest and this was the quality of Mexican food we were excited to be able to get.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk so there Prices have gone through the roof!\nWe had 2 orders fajitas beef an chicken  2 sodas....That's all bill was $40.00 left $6.00 tip,service was good....Alot of onions not alot of meat ....plate didn't even sizzle when brought to table...Was not $40.00 dollar good...epically at lunch time\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe this might be the best Mexican food I have had in Phoenix.  \n\nTo start, be ready for a possible walk....because their parking lot sucks!  haha  It's just too small.  I often have to park in the dirt lot across the street by the train tracks.  However....once you are inside, it is wonderful!  The place is well-kept and clean.  Atmosphere is great.  All of the staff are friendly, and the Managers are usually running around helping out and just chatting with the customers.  \n\nThe food is Awesome!  I have been several times now with friends and family, and have tried many of their dishes.  My personal favorite is their specialty burrito - the El Rico!  Great mix of ingredients and spices.  \n\nIf you get a chance, stop in.  You won't regret it!\n\n\n\n\n\nValentines day 2011. Bad service, bad food, Place has really gone down  hill since our last visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here tonight for the first time with friends, will not be back. Sat at the bar for almost 10 minutes before bartender even acknowledged us. Once we were seated it was fine  waiter was nice, took our order right away, but once the food came it was a different story. Someone else brought our food, my friend and I ordered fajitas and we're not given our tortillas. It took 10 to 15 minutes before I was able to flag down our waiter to ask for them, when he brought the tortillas back we told him that our meal  hot and he offered to \"reheat\" them... we declined, as our other friends had almost finished their meals.  He never asked us if we wanted another round of drinks. He brought the bill and didn't take anything off our bill or offer free desert to compensate. I asked for the manager who listened, apologized, and said he'd adjust the bill; our waiter brought the bill back telling us he had taken $5 off each of our meals.  As we were leaving, the manager came back to offer us a $10 off coupons. We turned them down because we felt disappointed in how they handled our situation...why would we want to come to back here?!\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow average food. Was served cold tamales. They reheated it and served it again. Should have made a whole new order. Rice was hard & crispy. Seemed left over from previous day.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the El bombero. It was very good. Very authentic and delicious. The other 7 adults really enjoyed there meals also.\n\n\n\n\n\nChimichangas were great! Loved the crispyness. The service was less than attentive however. And they wouldn't  let use the Yelp 1.99 coupon for a Margarita because  they said it was for a different  location.\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd time here and still the best buffet in town! The food takes me to another place, as if I'm in Mexico City again! Full of flavor and not just thrown together. \n\nThe service was ok. Felt like was being a little rushed but it's all good. I do appreciate the hostess she was nice. I will definitely be coming back and inviting other people.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a surprise it was finding this place. Amazing tortillas made fresh as you order. Not often do I give five stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my wife love it\n\nWe usually go to the one on Grand\n\nThe cocktails\nFor her Pina Colada (its the best one I ever had ) \"it rocks\"\nFor me the usual cold beer ( Bud Light draft) ice cold I mean like almost frozen perfect temperature\n\nThe food \nShe had shredded beef burrito with rice and beans ( big hot and juicy just the way I like it) .....lol thats what she said \n\nI had the shrimps I forget the name \nI think its berncillo carmorns? \nWell anywho!\nIt's the best ever!\n\nThe service\nAs soon as we walked in Emily was there to greet us she's awesome\nI had a couple questions and she answered them \n\nWe waited a couple (5) minutes for our table not too bad \n\nRight after we sat down the manager Ramon greeted us                    ( very professional )\n\nEmily help us get a high chair for my daughter \n\nThe chips and salsa got the table fast\n\nJose are server was very professional\nHe told us all about food and how it's prepared\n\nOverall the service is something you find in a 5star las vegas Steakhouse \nThink Bellagio \n\nThe restaurant is very clean and so are the restrooms they're amazing Spanish tiles I can appreciate a nice sink and vanity\n\nWell if I'm ever in the mood for Mexican food I won't go anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n2 stars for the food, +1 star for the ambiance & service :) \n\nHaving said that, they put cheese on EVERYTHING.... luckily they didn't douse the drinks, lol! \nI don't know, when it comes to real Mexican food, I'm a purist :)\nIf you're going to put cheese on something then let it be an authentic Mexican cheese! I don't like my food smothered in Jack, American or any other Velveta like substance :(  Now, I'm sure that if you ask for no cheese they will oblige! Learn from my mistakes :) \n\nThe machaca I salvaged from beneath the layer of cheese was good.\n \nI did not want the rice & beans (don't judge me) so the waiter asked if I wanted a salad instead. I said YES, & could it have avocados? Oh yeah! \nI did get my salad. Iceberg lettuce, little tomato & about 3 slices of avocado. I ate the avocado & when my bill came realized that although I did not get rice & beans my meal was priced the same AND I was charged extra for the avocado. I paid it, but I don't think I'll do that again. \n\nI did not have any alcoholic beverages, just coffee, & that was not great either.\n\n\n\n\n\nYUM!!! Haven't had good Mexican food like this in a while! This is my new favorite spot!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food!!!  It had been a bit since I had been to rio but we had a coupon from a local fundraiser.  Chips were warm and fresh, had the Rico special with beef and hubby had the pollo especial.   Both were excellent but I will do chicken in the rio next time.   We will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a good lunch break spot if you are on your lunch break and have an entire hour to spare. The service seems to always be great, but it can get pretty crowded during lunch. \nIf you are in Surprise and have a more authentic Mexican food craving and alternative to Chipotle and Caramba's where you can sit down, kick back and have a few margaritas, then this place is your choice. \n\nThe tacos and lunch enchilada specials can never be beat during lunch. When you order the fish tacos or enchiladas del mar (with shrimp), the soft taco shells are soft and oily versus just regular soft flaky corn tortillas or crunchy type tortillas. I just end up eating the inside of the taco, so it's a bit rich for my taste to eat the oiliness. Don't get me wrong, I know that when I'm eating Mexican, it's not necessarily going to be healthy, but it gets overwhleming when you have 2 layer soggy taco shells to eat per taco so it doesn't fall apart on you. \n\nChimichangas are pretty good here. Again, not really the typically true Mexican fare, but they satiate the craving for crunchy friedness filled with shredded beef or chicken goodness. Overall, this place is \"A-OK\" in my book, but nothing overally spectacular.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Minnesota and  come here every winter cause service is outstanding and 5 star excellent taste. Leave the winters back in Minnesota and  get what we love and crave, parking is difficult but well worth every bit\n\n\n\n\n\nVery tasty but way overpriced.  You will leave hungry unless you order several plates of food.\n\n\n\n\n\n***UPDATE*** \nI went to the Sunday Buffet several days ago and the Menudo was very good! I'm glad as this now adds another meal to enjoy. On the \"down side,\" their excellent server, Cecilia has changed her schedule. She only works the Sunday Brunch when they are short staffed. :-(\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, I guess I am updating my review.... From 2 starts to 5 again !!!! Love service and food !!!! Jose is great and a lot of new service people .\n\n\n\n\n\nI am always on the lookout for new Mexican spots to try out as it's my favorite cuisine.  Had visitors in town and so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived at 5 on a Friday and we just beat the rush.  After ordering a happy hour margarita at the bar we were seated.  Many people arrived after us and you could tell there was a long wait.  \nChips and salsa were great.  A nice little kick to the salsa.  The menu is really nice but a little confusing the way they have it put together-I kept missing items!  I'd think I knew what I wanted to order and then bam, an item I'd somehow not seen would pop up and I'd want to change.  I ended up with the Tomatillo Enchiladas which were delicious.  Everyone in our party of 7 were quite pleased!  We had just received our bill when the mariachi band showed up.  They found a spot right next to our table and we were able to enjoy a couple songs which the kids LOVED.  \nAlso you can take home their amazing and fresh tortillas for a decent price.  I'm going to remember that little factoid!\nWe are very pleased we tried this location-the music, fun decor and ambiance added to our night and we will definitely return.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe took a break from the Christmas shopping craziness and had dinner at Rio Mirage tonight. The food was delicious. \n\nChips and salsa are complimentary.\nThe chips were a little oily, like they had been re-fried to reheat, but the salsa is sooo good!\n\nHub had a fried burrito (chimichanga) enchilada style. The steak inside was super tender and flavorful. \n\nAs usual, I ordered more than I could eat.\n\nI ordered albondigas (meatball soup), mainly because I have made it but never eaten a restaurant version (and I was cold). It was great and would have filled me up all on its own. Savory meatballs, carrots, celery, onions, potatoes, cabbage (I think) and rice, floating in a thick chili broth. Comfort food. \n\nFor main course I had Mahi Mahi tacos, with double beans since I don't like  rice much. Cubes of well seasoned fish, grilled and served in soft fried corn tortillas (soft but not dry) with lots of perfectly ripe avacado chunks. With a jicima pineapple salsa on the side. I prefer a cabbage slaw with fish tacos, but it was good. The beans were black beans, which I love, evenly cooked and topped with cheese. Luscious.\n\nMy margarita was made from a mix, but, hey, this is a low priced neighborhood restaurant. They did get the lightly salted rim part spot-on! \n\nNo room for dessert!\n\nAll of the service was great, from greeting to drinks to packing up my leftovers.\n\nErik is an awesome waiter. Give that man a raise!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo draft beer or even any beer for a froday!!! You can't get a burro enchilada stable either. Poor service also!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food! Excellent margarita, wonderful service. I had the chili relleno & taco .i ordered the large margarita it was HUGE and delicious. Really enjoyed my experience at the restaurant\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was great but the server took quite some time and they were out of more than a few items as far as drinks go. Shocking considering it was mother's day and cinco de may weekend. Regardless, a decent place if you don't mind the wait and the lack of some waiter complaints. Customers should never have to hear about the waiters many struggles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely love this restaurant. The food is amazing and the staff is always so pleasant. \n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is great, shrimp cocktails have an authentic flavor. The shredded beef tacos are my favorite. Fresh tortillas are a must! Would have given more stars but the wait staff is inconsistent, the food is with it though.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis cafe is in my neighborhood of El Mirage. We Love it here....the food, Margaritas, especially the Coyote Margarita with jalapenos, the service and strolling Mariachi band, the decor and ambiance.  You are greeted like an old friend and valued as a customer.  The manager walks around and asks if you are happy.  If you want hot and spicy, ask for it otherwise, the food is generally on the mild side.  What is superb about this place is that locals, others and snowbirds flock here like an oasis in the desert. Also, patio dining is romantic if you choose outside.   It is always crowded, busy and great positive energy!  Don't miss this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review is totally about the food.  It is fantastic.  We went on a Monday, first time there, and didn't know it was margarita Monday so it was a madhouse.  99 cent margaritas with food purchase.  The server was very non-talkative, rushed and busy and kind of left us there to find our check at the end of the meal, but the food was hot and really good so we were happy.  I have had Mexican food all over the US and I am so picky, and am super happy to find this place.  Just be prepared to wait a long time on Mondays!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was able to visit this establishment on 3/29 after Spring Training in Camelback. \n\nA friend of mine found this place based on the star rating on Yelp so we decided to give it a go. Upon arriving things looked like they were headed in the right direction, however, things changed once we sat down. \n\nThey were able to accommodate our large party of 8 which was nice, got in right before early dinner rush came in. Once we sat down, my girlfriend asked if we could get some water, the waitress responded \"Now?\", no we wanted water as were about to leave. The waitress did bring out one glass of water while everyone else waited. 15 mins later, a new waitress came out and finally brought water and took drink orders, after my friend had to flag her down and ask if we could order drinks. 15 mins later, the drinks finally came out, with a different waitress, even though there were was a surplus of workers. The Michelada was a bit watery, not enough tomato juice. \n\nThe service is a it slow, almost as if they are the tortoise in a race. The responses to questions felt like a forced, almost put off, response. Our drinks weren't cleared until the chip man came around and had to be asked, even then, he removed the chips and two glasses. The other glasses were left behind as if they were two week old enchiladas. \n\nOnce the food came out, that sort of brought it up to par. I shared the carne asada plate and it was pretty good, the flour tortillas were the highlight. \n\nI'm not sure what the 75 4-star rating is about, there was nothing amazing about the place and probably wouldn't go back if I am in the Phoenix area.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been to this restaurant on four separate occasions. We are three out of four. On this last visit the food was not very hot, so we returned our meal. The food returned hot, hot lettuce, hot tomatoes, pretty half ass.\n\n\n\n\n\nServer sucked but food was good. Waited quite awhile for someone to even take drink order.  Then had to ask for her to place food order.  Never saw her again. Someone else brought food and our bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Mexican food we've found near Surprise, az. \ni like their Sunday brunch but i LOVE that they have mariachi on fridays! \nso even if i can cook some of their dishes with more flavor, i will come for the mariachi.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos.  They were amazing.  We both loved them.  The salsa is great, and the atmosphere is very festive.  We will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy parents and I are visiting my grandpa who lives in the area. Yelpers said this was the Mexican place to go! So glad we did! The previous reviews did not lie.   We arrived around 6 and the place was packed! They were understaffed tonight so the wait was longer than usual. No big deal. \n\nThe food was awesome. Huge portions. Plenty of choices. Reasonable prices. The margaritas were good as well. They could have been a little stronger, but that's okay given that we were driving. I hope my grandpa comes back because we certainly would if we lived in the area!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were in town for the weekend and tried this place based on the reviews. It is Soooo good! Probably one of the best chicken chimi I have had. I got it with the jalapeno cream cheese. The guacamole is really good. The ambiance is warm, colorful and inviting. The service was fast and friendly. The beans and rice were very good, and so was the salsa. I would definitely recommend this as a place for a date or friends night out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mariachi band really made our visit enjoyable.\nThe food was great, and so was my margarita. The enchilada sauce was spiced differently than what we expected, but who wants the same old thing every time? \nThe only thing that detracted from our experience was that our virgin daiquiri was a bit more expensive than we expected. It costs more than did my medium margarita! Overall, though, I am convinced that this will be our \"go to\" Mexican restaurant in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nI got this tip from a fellow yelper who told me to try this place, and I wish we would have gone earlier in the trip because we would have gone back a couple of times.\nThe food was awesome!! The best chips and salsa, I couldn't get enough of them, very crisp and not greasy at all, salsa was fresh and chunky and full of flavor.\n\nFor dinner, my hubby got the El Rico Burrito, it was the best, it was a cross between a burrito and a Chimichanga, with the best sauce covering the top. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!\nI ordered the Spinach and Chicken Enchiladas, you get 2 larges ones and they were very good also, served with beans and rice.\nEverything was wonderful and fresh, also the Margaritas on Saturday are 1/2price which is a big plus.  We had 2 jumbo ones each, and they really buzzed us up, good thing we ate big meals!\n\nThis is a cute quaint place, decorated very well with the Mexican flare, made you feel like you were there!\n\nNow the reason for the 4 stars instead 5,  I was going to give the 5 until we both went into the bathrooms, each bathroom had a lot of water on the floor, not sure where it was coming from but it needed to be mopped up.  In the women's someone had used the toilet and did not flush, it was not pretty. If they regularly would have checked them it would have been noticed since there is only toilet. \n\nDon't let that scare you off, it must have overlooked that night, they were very busy at the time.  Rio Mirage Caf Y Cantina is worth the trip! Try it out sometime!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have had more than my fair share of Mexican food but this place is no-questions-asked the best Mexican food I have ever had. Unless your question is 'what should I get?' Our server recommended El Rico and his recommendation did not fail me. Chicken, poblano peppers, onions, mushrooms, jalapeo cream cheese... Oh, jalapeo cream cheese. Then smothered in cheese and whatever other heavenly stuff they did to that burrito. Pure perfection. If I'm ever back in Arizona, I will certainly find my way here just to order El Rico again.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow best Mexican food so far. I live out in surprise and it's not to far. Food is amazing. Staff is so friendly. This is our new place!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chips and salsa were fresh, and they kept them coming without us ever having to ask for more.  I had the lunch special, Chile Relleno, with refried beans and rice, and all three items were fresh.  Can't ask for much better in Mexican food.....will definitely return again!\n\n\n\n\n\nGross food. Not authentic Mexican food at all. I didn't like it one bit. To each her own though.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time at the original location. \nLove the restaurant. Classic Mexican food. I ordered a shrimp burrito and it was outstanding! Their rice and beans are exceptionally good as well! \nI also ordered a sangria. Different than what I was expecting-they add orange juice to the wine-but good and refreshing nonetheless! \nWill definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your a vegetarian there is only one dish on the menu. The . My wife asked about that dish and our waiter copped an attitude when asked about the #5(  Chile Relleno & Green (only) Tamale) and #6(Red or Green Chile Burro & Cheese Enchilada)  items on the menu. The #5 dish had no meat which constitutes a vegetarian dish. \nI had the Slow Roasted Carnitas. The waiter asked me if I wanted flour or corn  tort i l l a s. I asked for corn and was never given them. \nI have never experienced such a lack of customer service from a waiter in my dining at any restaurant. I wish I had his name so I could tell someone about our experience. \nThe food was good but I seriously doubt I would come back to this restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the food here.  I recommend the Rio Rico burrito.  I would also like to compliment the ladies at the check-in counter.  I've been in the restaurant when the lobby area is mobbed with diners, and the ladies are always very polite and courteous.  First class restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome.  Since I moved to AZ. from TX. I have been searching for good Mexican food and I finally found it.  Our server, Eric, was the best.  Took time to answer our questions, always with a smile.  The salsa was great and so were the tacos.  We went on Monday and the Margaritas were only $0.99 and were better than most other places.  We will be regulars here.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my Husband are new to town hes a very picky eater Lol we read other reviews and decided to try it. The food is amazing the drinks are Delicious and the over all look of the place was nice n authentic the service was outstanding great staff very nice people and a very clean environment. We will be back soon We loved it.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything was fast and delivered precisely. The food and drink were very delicious!  Will return again soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been long time customers at this location. The service has always been great! However, the last 2-3 times we have eaten here the food has been off. Our chicken in the pollo especial tasted old, like the taste of chicken that has sat in the fridge to long after being cooked. And the chips had a very weird dust taste to them. We notified our server about the chips and she brought us out a new batch that tasted even worse! We now drive the extra 5 miles to the surprise location. The food there is much better!\n\n\n\n\n\nThey gave us a buzzer to call us when our table would be ready. We we're the only people waiting to be seated but other people would walk in and they would sit them right away. Finally someone noticed that we haven't gotten a table then apologized for not seating us before other groups. Once we got to our table, someone came and brought chips and salsa, 5min later someone brings us utensils, 5mins more chips and salsa... We waited 20mins til someone took our order. The server that waited on us kept saying over and over that he wasn't our server so it felt like we were just a bother so we didn't ask for a drink refill or anything so we sat there thirsty. Ordered chicken nuggets for our son and they were burnt. The Pollo special was bland and I don't see a point frying it when it's drenched in sauce making it soggy. The ambience was nice though. Live mariachi band, cute restaurant but I don't think we'll be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I just found this place and loved it so much we went back two days later. We've lived here in AZ for about four years and haven't really been able to find a good Mexican place but this place is by far the best Mexican good we've had here. Very good margaritas as well. I also I want to say the staff has morals because I left a pair of sunglasses there and didn't realize it until the next day, called them and they still had them. They made my day!! I was almost in tears thinking there was no way they still have them. They were a gift from my daughter and she's currently in BMT and I've missed her so much. You can't replace a gift so whoever turned them in, thank you so much!! You made my day!\n\n\n\n\n\nSoooo great place! Real Mexican food! Do not go to the same place on Bell. Service there rude! This place is amazing & relaxing!!!! 10 stars!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nOk I am updating it again!!! From 2 to 5 stars!!! Love this place and glad that service changed , except for Jose!!!!! Great people and great food!!! Love it!!!!! Highly recommend this place\n\n\n\n\n\nLOVE THIS PLACE!!  What a wonderful delight in the barrio! Cute and fun decor with a great atmosphere! Handmade flour tortillas sealed the deal for me! Hot, chewy, pillowy and just plain deliciosa!\n\nMicheladas are so fun! Enjoyed the brunch which was amazing in their flavor and freshness. Did not taste like dishes had been sitting in warmer if you get my drift. \n\nChorizo egg scramble was yummy! Bacon and eggs are solid but unremarkable. Need to stick with the ethnic dishes-- puerco verde, enchiladas, sopa pasoles etc were amazing. Too full for the menudo and missed the chilaquiles. But the homemade churros are a must-have!\n\nAnd best of all--very reasonable $$. A definite must-return not only for the brunch but the rest of the menu also.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood comes out to you hot and fresh, in generous servings. Service is friendly, venue is big, and features colonial Mexican decor indoors and a large outdoor patio for seating large groups. Overall good experience. But, menu is somewhat limited in that no ala carte single items are offered, nor any carnitas or pork dishes.\nOur party of three enjoyed the dinners, but were mostly unimpressed by  the sauces which seemed somewhat bland.\nWould try this restaurant again but for happy hour instead. Or, maybe Friday night for Mariachis performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, Midwest guys, best ever Mexican.  Why?  Authentic.  More locals than snowbirds which tells you something.  Right flavors on my mexican comfort food list.  The homemade red sauce on the cheese enchilada.  The tender beef chunks in the red burro with just the right, again, red sauce that was different than the enchilada sauce.  \n\nThe lovely Maureen had the mahi tacos with chunks of fresh avocados. Homemade corn tortillas not the standard flour tho that's available.\n\nEnvironment is fine: that's not the reason to come here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the amount of time it took to get our food, you would have thought everything would be super fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, not the case. Had to wait 20 minutes to order and another 40 minutes for our food. Then 15 more minutes at the end of the meal to get our waiter's attention so we could pay. Probably could have walked out without them noticing. The food was average, and had it been quick and with great service might have warranted a better rating, but unfortunately nothing was stellar about this restaurant. I would not recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent margaritas, the food was fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere! A true gem and we are definitely coming back!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery authentic Mexican restaurant in the town of El Mirage. Food is good, atmosphere is old fashioned as if you were in a Mexican cantina. Old rustic building adds to the flavor.  I like the fajitas. A nice meal that can be shared. Wash it down with a margarita and you just saved a trip to Mexico!  Cool to sit outside on the back patio if it's not too hot outside. Inside the booths are cool too. I've been going here for years and have never been disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been here a couple of times and every single time it is amazing!! The food is hot, fresh, and always tastes delicious!! The service is great too. Even if we come in close to closing they always have a smile on their face like they were waiting all day for us   We will keep coming back. Amazing!!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know how you go to a place for the first time and its totally awesome.. then you go back sometime later and the experience is not as good then the first.. thats Rio Mirage in El Mirage, AZ.\n\nThe first time we stopped in this place was awesome! They had the yummiest rice and beans.. as well as very good chimi's enchiladas etc.. but since the first time we've been there it just hasn't been as good.. the rice dry and greasy.. the beans, run of the mill.. food being burnt and greasy, greasy, greasy.. spotty service and in my opinion sub par ingredients make this place now an avoid.. what a shame too since they had so much going for them. Very disappointing.\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived about an hour and half before closing on a Saturday night.  They had already put chairs up and mopping the floors.  Another group had come in about the same time as we did.  Seems like they were going to close early, however they decided to seat us.  \n\nThe food was good no complaints as was the service.  Salsa and chips awesome.\n\nIf you area in the area it is worth the stop.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond time visiting this location and they have sold me for life.  Amazing customer service and delicious food.  The 99 cent margaritas on Monday don't hurt either ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family and I just came to have brunch and the waiter wasn't friendly. She would take so long to come back to bring our drinks. We also had the complementary champagne that comes with the brunch. When we asked her if she could refill our glass, she said that it's only 2 per customer!! This is the first time I go to a place for Sunday brunch that only serves 2 glass of champagne per customer!! The food wasn't as I expected. Won't come back here again!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe just move to Goodyear from Texas.  The food here is 5 star awesome.  The chicken El Rico was so tender, juicy and flavorful.  The service was great and the atmosphere was authentic.\n\nWe have found our place.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmended review: we walked in for a Sunday dinner and the girl said they closed at 8p. When I responded it was only 7.45p she said that she didn't think we could eat that fast. The place was full of people...Does that mean they kick everyone out at 8p? It was very unprofessional on top of not making any sense. She just didn't want to serve us and stay later. Won't be back.\n\nOriginal review: Really liked this place, one of the better texmex places I've eaten at in az. Was pleased to see them doing a deep cleaning while they were slow. The waiter recommend the Rio Burrito which was delicious. Topped off with .99 margaritas on Monday. I highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden gem here in the Phoenix area. Was very crowded but able to get a seat outside. Great pre game chips and salsa and guacamole.  Fish tacos were top notch.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust left the Sunday buffet at the \"Rio\" and had a great meal! I was able to meet the Alda today who is the resturant manager and we discussed a small issue I noticed at the buffet today. I have to say that she has done an excellent job since we first discovered the \"Rio\" about 6-8 months ago.  I wish her and the \"familia\" the best for thier two resturant locations!   - Daniel -  ;-)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've been to Sunday Brunch numerous times. I always look for waitess Cecila to serve us  as she is an EXCELLENT waitress. I think she has ESP because she always knows what we need before we have time to ask her for it!  LOL!\nThe majority of the brunch is excellent especially the grilled jalepenos, chorizo, chil verde and colorado. The Chile Rellenos are to die for!!!  Acording to the manger, they only serve one tray of them so if you dont get there when they open and you are one the first persons in the buffet line, you may not taste these killer relenos!!!.\nThe only complaint I have is on the menudo. Whoever makes this stuff  needs to he sent back to \"menudo cooking school,\" LOL! It has no flavor and I have yet to find a slice of tripe in it. It looks like they used beef and bone scraps to make. It is an insult to call it menudo. \nTo summarize, you love most of the food and service. Just dont eat the menudo.\n\nDaniel\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was a bit tucked in to the neighborhood in which it sits. So much larger on the inside and the place was really cool inside. We were seated and the host and the waitstaff were very accommodating and friendly, giving recommendations and good conversation, as it was our first time here. My aunt and son went with a rolled quesadilla thing and they were not disappointed! Tasty and plentiful! I had a smothered burrito, and I was so pleasantly surprised, the meat was tender and even though it looked huge when it arrived, it was a good portion. \nWhen in this area again, we will return!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe waited over an hour at the bar for our food and then didn't get what we ordered no explanation or apology. We will not go back very disappointing\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love coming to Rio Mirage when we are on the west side.  We have come in several times with a group of 8+ and everytime we are accomodated quickly and with execellent service!\n\nThe food is always amazing and had never disappointed.  Two people at our table tried the Bonitarita and the Margarita..wow...the Bonitarita knocked it out of the park.  It is a great margarita...it is a little more expensive but worth every penny!!\n\nWe also ordered fajitas (two of us split the order), I was so impressed with the number of shrimp and veggies in the order, but a little disappointed they only gave 2 tortillas.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered their speciality borritio, El Rico. It was a absolutely amazing! I would definitely go there again.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't say anything about the food, as we were never served.  We never saw a server, even after sitting at our table for 15 minutes. Unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went here for dinner June 2nd to celebrate my friend's birthday: we ordered drinks and never saw our server again after he brought them 25 minutes went by. The saving grace? I went up to the front and said something and we got a new server who was amazing and apologetic. I ordered another drink and she said that ut (along with three other drinks) were on the menu but unavailable. She recommended a watermelon cocktail that was, however, DELICIOUSI ordered fish tacos that were delicious and my friend was very happy with her  chicken fajitas. I have been coming here for years and live the atmosphere and patio. Eventhough this location is not in a nice neighborhood like the Surprise location, this one is worth visiting. I unfortunately had to give them 3 stars due to the wait time for service otherwise, I highly recommend. I will note that food is not as spicy as some might like though children and seniors would appreciate this fact.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food and the service was amazing! It was my first time here. I ordered the #1 which was a shredded beef taco and enchilada with rice and beans. Everything was really good, fresh and authentic!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent in this past Sunday about 10:30. We were seated promptly by a very friendly and open Manager. Our server came quickly to take our drink orders. He was not overtly friendly or chatty, but polite and thorough. The food came quickly. I ordered the Ensenada Fish Tacos which were MASSIVE and DEVINE!! My plate also came with Beans (topped with cheese) and rice, and a side of chopped lettuce and diced tomatoes. My kids ordered a side of beans and rice which tasted fresh and which they rated as AWESOME. My husband ordered the Chicken Nachos and they were HUGE!! He said he was starving going in, but was only able to finish off half of his plate (even with some help from our 6 year old). Our food was fantastic. The chips and salsa were so good that we ordered a bag of chips and a Quart of Salsa to go! Our server came several times during the meal checking on the levels of our drinks, and refilled quickly, but wasn't so overtly chatty or buggy that he interrupted our meal or conversation. I would DEFINITELY go back again. I was happy with the food and service. \n\n** I have also had their catered Platters which are kind of pricey, but HEAVENLY!! They serve mini tacos, mini chimis and mini taquitos, with sides of sour cream, salsa and guacamole and a bag of chips. SO GOOD!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere's Rudell?  Miss his friendly face.  Henry is great, too.  Hopefully, Rudell is doing well.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust OK. Friendly efficient service, but the food was not too flavorful. Three of us went and none of us were thrilled. On a good note, the chips and salsa and flour tortillas were good quality. I had to ask for the hot salsa though.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently sitting at the table... arrived at 9:12 pm closing time is 10 pm. Realize that we arrived 48 mins til closing. Not only were we hurried to order but our server looked at his watch and pointed at it and said \"we're going to close\". The staff were obnoxious and cussing at one another. When the plates arrived they were piping hot and couldn't even eat fast enough since they wanted us to hurry and leave. We weren't even half way through our late dinner and they were already asking if we wanted boxes for our food. Very rude. The food was good but the atmosphere was not welcoming.\n\n\n\n\n\nI always go to this location and I love it!  food is always good, atmosphere is great and staff is friendly.  It can be very loud on Friday nights because of the Mariachi band that plays but it adds to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first impression was this is Mexican restaurant for non-Mexicans in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood but regardless, the food was amazing all around our table.  Don't miss the homemade tortillas.  Mild spicing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBartender was rude and ignored me completely. I left the bar once and he was really chatty with my wife. Never checked if we were OK. He made a point to talk to every other person but me. Even left my drink on his side on the bar too not giving it to me. Never will I go back!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nwe went to this place with a group of 8 people. the restaurant was VERY busy but we got in promptly. we had the $.99 margaritas which were fine. my wife and I split the chicken fajitas which were excellent. I'm not sure how one person could possibly eat them all.  the flour tortillas are made on site and are amazing. service was prompt and pleasant. prices are very reasonable.  a great find!!,\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped by on a Tuesday evening, service and food was good, a little pricy but worth the stop.  Will stop back when wanting Mexican food and atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's ok.  The wait staff was really really slow.  The food was good but greasy. It's location is hard to find.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant struck us all as a solid 4 star establishment.  The four adults had different dishes from a combination plate to the burrito de fajita to different dinner plates.  Each was very good and all came with the rice and beans.  We pretty much give thumbs up or down based on the rice and beans and these were some of the best any of us have sampled and we all hail originally from CA where they flow freely.  \n\nThe manager runs a taught ship and the service reflects his hand.  Everyone is very professional providing just the right amount of attention.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice, homey and comfortable.  We'll definitely return.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile looking for an old favorite Mexican restaurant we couldn't find, we stumbled upon Rio Mirage.  It was very busy, which is always a good sign.  We were not disappointed.  The food was very good but a tad bit pricey.  There weren't enough a la carte items.  However, the four of us all enjoyed our food.  We also went to the Rio Mirage in Sun City West, but for some reason the one in El Mirage seemed to be better and tastier.\n\n\n\n\n\nRio Mirage is an amazing small spot in El Mirage!! \nGreat drinks! Chips and salsa! \nSunday Brunch is delicious!! \nService is always quick and friendly !!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food. Watered down drinks. Doesn't honor coupons. Under staffed. Food was only good experience about it..\n\n\n\n\n\nI really love the El Mirage location of Rio Mirage.  The food tastes great, the service is awesome, the atmosphere is nice, and the Monday margarita deals are phenomenal!  I will mention the Surprise location does not earn the same rating, but the El Mirage location is the best Mexican around!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food. Loved the live entertainment. The rolled quesadilla is huge! The salsa that comes with the free chips is amazing! My husband went through 4 cups of it! I went on a Friday night at 730. There was about a 30 minute wait and it was very crowded. We couldn't really see the band from our table but the music was still enjoyable. Our server seemed busy. The manager had to take our drink order. Although I would have liked better service and a better view I still had a good time and will definitely go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood, quality food.  Friendly staff.  Bummed I missed the $ .99 margaritas.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went for Saturday lunch which was excellent. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The decor was excellent. \n\nThe portions were very generous and we enjoyed everything from the chips and salsa to our entrees to our drinks. \n\nDefinitely a return visit in our near future.\n\n\n\n\n\nI usually goto the other Rio Mirage location. This was a great location for dinner with my folks, dad has a hearing aid and always complains of too much noise. Place has cozy seating with booths and seating in dark corners. You can seat yourself at the tables by the bar or wait in the que. at 7:30pm it was a 15 minute wait. Huge portions and carb overload of course. Great service.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill like this location. However, lost a star since the recording says they are open at 9:00am on Sunday for brunch. Sitting here at 9:45 and still not open.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Yelp we ventured into this neighbourhood for a Mexican meal. \n\nFirst a note on the neighbourhood. It is beside the tracks and away from the sanitized neighbourhoods of Sun City. Some individuals may not be comfortable and should consider a noon meal. For those more comfortable with world travel, this should be in the top of their list. \n\nWalking in immediately brought me back to a Mexicaleri in Merida, Mexico. The bright colours, painted walls and multiple rooms are typical Mexican. \n\nThe staff match the decor and know their stuff in regards to making suggestions and attentively keep diners happy. \n\nThe food was amazing. All of the usual dishes are in the menu. The flavours are fabulous. The balance of chilli, cilantro and cumin was perfect.\n\nThis would be a regular for me if I lived in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith my minnie me in a so needed outing.......NEVER EVER have I had anything bad here.....ALWAYS GREAT FOOD & SERVICE. I recommend U give them a try if U already haven't.....U will be back\n\n\n\n\n\n4 of us had dinner, everything ordered was bland and uninspired. The ambiance is nice but beyond that you won't find anything worth ordering again. Even the Cadillac Marguerita that was supposed to have Grand Marnier was totally bland. Oh, and one of us got severe food poisoning.  A 1 star rating is generous.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food, authentic atmosphere, friendly staff: this place has it all. Probably about 12 different margaritas varieties, I simply cannot express how much i enjoyed this restaurant. We just moved here from California (My gf and I) and I have found my new Mexican place! ;-)\n\n\n\n\n\nI never rate anyone this low.  Drinks were ok to good. What didn't impress me was the sub par service.  I felt the waitress was lacking patience and hospitality. Definitely an older crowd at this place but that made me think do others experience this? Hmm well I won't be returning can't comment on the food. I'm sure a different staff member would have made the experience more pleasant to the point I would of tried it a second time if desired.  The surprise location is always great to go to! Been there about 4 times.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food,great atmosphere,phenomenal service! Great spot for a large group, next time we're in town we will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is average. The prices are high compared to other mexican restaurants. But the staff is great. Always greeted with a smile, attentive, and caring. I keep going back cause it's not so bad. Although I think the chicken flautas could use more flavor. The Carne asada is good.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave gone here 2x. First time was during the week at 2:00. Taken right to a table. Love the salsa. Just right amount of flavor. Also really liked my chicken enchiladas. Red sauce is yummy. But on 2nd visit at 1:00 on a Sunday, had a 2 minute wait which they said would be 10 minutes, and the restaurant wasn't even half full. Maybe short handed? We could tell a couple waitresses were rushed and not very happy. Took a bit to get our chips and salsa even. Food finally came, didn't like the fajita burrito as much as my first meal. Same good red sauce, but had dark meat chicken and I only like white meat. A couple at a table by us got up and left because they were tired of waiting. Not sure if I will return myself. Seems like it might be hit and miss with this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best Mexican places around. The owner always greats you with a smile. Lately it has been kinda a hit and miss. But still good. Sunday Brunch is always fun.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped by the day before Cinco de Mayo to get our fix and we were pleasantly surprised at what this place had to offer. The pitcher of margaritas hit the spot. My daughter loved her kids meal. The only reason I can't give it five stars is that we had to wait forever for the check.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just tried this place for the first time after moving in down the street.  The first thing that struck me was that their tortillas are homemade amd extremely fresh.  I had some albondigas soup.  It was well seasoned but not overly salty like at some other restaurants.  Happy with what I was seeing so far I decided to order my favorite Mexican dish, Chile Relleno, to see how it stacked up against some other places I had tried it.  Once again I was pleasantly surprised.  It was cooked perfectly.  There was still some firmness to the pepper but it was very tender.  They did not overpower the dish with spices or sauces, so the flavor of the pepper shined through.  Not the most delicious Mexican food I've ever had, but up there.\n\nThe service was standard.  Staff was nice and food and drinks came out quickly.  The ambiance was warm and inviting.  I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a solid Mexican restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Mexican food we've found in Phoenix area, as well as best we've found. Well seasoned but not spicey hot. Salsa was the best and chips were fresh.\n\nLunch Special #2 Chicken Enchilada ($7) came with Mexican rice and refried beans excellent flavor. Two-item combination #5 Chile Relleno and Green Corn Tamale was superb. Tamale light and Relleno batter flavorful.\n\nOmar gave us friendly quick service.\n\nCan't wait to return.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my favorite \"sit down\" Mexican restaurants. Their chimichangas are the best! The only problem I've ever had there is the slow service, but the food makes up for it every time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me start by saying we have ordered from here many times prior to tonight and never had any issues.  Until tonight.  I always order the Burrito De Fajitas with chicken.   This time, it had 4 pieces of chicken and was filled.....I mean filled with onion.  Not even fresh onion.  It tasted like it sat out for two days before it was cooked.  I couldnt eat past the first couple of bites.  This is ridiculous!  I will not be returning after this experience.   You've lost two customers due to this.  \n\nI have pictures to add if yelp let's me...\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways a favorite! I grew up in Phoenix and now live on the East coast. When visiting friends and family this is a MUST for me. Chips and salsa are super tasty. Best shredded beef tacos ever (my Dad will even order two even though he usually orders a burro anywhere else). And solid cheese enchiladas. Not much more to want. Some people complain that the service is slow, but they are just a little more laid back than the typical restaurants that force you to hurry up to eat so they can rush you away to refill your seat with a new customer. They let you take time for conversation and to enjoy your food with no rush. I will always come here when I am n Phoenix. The staff are friendly and the food is delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've been going to Rio Mirage Cafe for many years, since before we were even Surprise residents, and 9 times out of 10, we have had a great experience.  The food has always been hot and yummy.  Never had a complaint about the food.  Good margaritas,  Great value, not too expensive but not the cheapest Mexican food out there.  The customer service is almost always on point.  We have had a few servers that weren't so friendly (end of night, not busy, but seemed bothered by us) but MOST of the time, they are friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Rio Mirage, give them a try, and don't forget to order a margarita.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food. Love buying fresh tortillas by the dozen also. Owners is very friendly and always walking around. Only reason for 4 stars is the salsa tastes a bit sweeter than it used to. Not as good as it used to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's okay.   I went back again after misremembering that it was the same the last time I went.  There are lots of options in the Phoenix suburbs--I will continue to look to those.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place! The food is great and feels like your eating authentic Mexican food not like Chipotle! I prefer the El Mirage location over the Surprise location because of its authenticy and the fact that its the original! If you go try the El Rico burrito in beef or chicken, or half and half you won't be disappointed! Only drawback is it that during our cooler Arizona months its packed with snowbirds!\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me first say that I so wanted to love this place. I grew up in Cali where I've had great Mexican food and after reading these reviews we wanted to take my mother out for a great Mexican  dinner while we were here visiting.\n\nWe tried 4 different dishes and they were so mediocre.  I kept trying every one else's thinking it was just mine, I had the spicy shrimp dish.  Not so much.\n\nMy mom had the chimichanga which was ok but everything else was meh...\n\nIf it was just decent I may go back and I understand every place has an off night but this was so far off I don't know if we will go back.\n\nOn the plus side and the reason for 2 stars is the service was very good and extremely friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely amazing food and the margaritas are no joke! We have eaten here a few times and recently went with our son and some friends. My son (who lives in San Diego) lived it too! The homemade flour tortillas are no joke, my husband had the red chili and wasn't disappointed!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was back here a couple of days ago with my family. And although I remember The food being a lot better than this time around. I was kind of disappointed. \n\nThe service was okay since I had no Jose this time.\nNothing to mention here just refills chips salsa and beverages when you need and food when it's ready. This waitress was just doing her job. And I guess that's fine for a lot of people but not for me remembering how this place used to be.\n\n\nAt no time did the waitress hostess or owner manager came by our table to ask us how our food was. \n\nThis magical Mexican Cantina has lost it's magic\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch specials are good, EXCEPT, they should.last until 3:00 or 4:00 pm.and they should be available to seniors during the evening like the other good Mexican food restaurants.  I hope they give it some thought.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything contributed to an all-around excellent experience. The building was surprisingly large but very welcoming, with wonderful pottery and murals. The staff were helpful and humorous. The salsa was relatively mild and quite chunky in the best sense of term. I ordered \"The Firefighter\", spicy steak in onions, chili sauce, etc., and it was flavorful, hearty, and delicious (yet not as spicy as I expected, though I am a native Arizonan who eats plenty of Mexican). Not to mention, if your meal comes with their fresh, thick flour tortillas, they can be refilled on request, and they even come in a colorful wicker basket. I would definitely return. I would also like to note that they were accommodating to a service dog, even though he didn't even have any bandana or identification.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is great! The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious! You can get three sizes of margaritas (if that's your thing), sometimes for half off or for $1. My parents, boyfriend, and I went after a day out in the sun at the botanical gardens and shared a plate of nachos supreme along with a few beers. Yummy!! For $11 the nachos were more than enough for the four of us. I like how they put enchilada sauce on them. They were very accommodating putting the meat on the side and adding beans on top instead. Our waiter was really nice and made sure we had everything we needed. The front of the restaurant smelled a bit strong of cleaning products, but hey, at least I knew it was clean :) Oh, and if you want to sit on the patio, be ready to listen to the train that passes right by the place.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother wonderful meal with good friends at Rio Mirage Cafe in El Mirage  I love the food, it's always consistently good.  Lately I have discovered Combination #2.  That's enchiladas with shredded beef (lots of shredded beef.)  The sauce is great, perfect mixed with my rice and beans.  As always they are very generous with their tortilla chips and salsa.  And on Mondays the 99 cent frozen Margaritas are great thirst quenchers.  I think the servers have always been great at Rio Mirage and tonight Xavier was  exceptional.  And so with good food.  good service and good friends  there is much to love about Rio Mirage.  I almost forgot the 99 cent margaritas, very good also.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious food and great ambiance. My only complaint is I wish they had better or more spaces to park as it gets crowded here quick. Otherwise the staff is friendly, the food is served fairly quick, and the restaurant is cute with a nice Spanish background. Also, the food here is not very spicy but still packs a punch of flavors.\n\n\n\n\n\nMargaritas were refreshing and delicious! Beef Chimichanga and Chicken chimichanga were really delicious! Made note of the Sunday Buffet. We were there about the time it ended but looked like it might have been a good option earlier! The tamales are decent sized and they make maza like I do , with chili in the dough!!!\nHow good was this place? Good enough that hubby asked me to book mark it!\n\n\n\n\n\nRio Mirage in El Mirage has gotten kind of blah. The food used to be spicer, more flavorful, just had some pop to it. The service has been meh as well the last few visits. This most recent visit, he never came to check on us nor did we get a single refill. I hope that they will take this to heart as a long time El Mirage resident who has been a regular customer that they should NOT tone down the flavor of the food to satisfy the old-sters who only come for a few months out of the year. If you are wondering why your place isn't as packed when those folks go home--now you know why!\n\n\n\n\n\nOn our way to Sedona and used yelp to determine where to stop. Easy location off highway. Staff is super friendly. Authentic food. We ordered chicken Mexican pizza and it was great. Large. Their salsa is good, tad different but wonderful. Warm chips served. We split the 3 combination plate with 2 tacos and enchilada. Looks like a amazing outdoor patio. Huge disappointment to be told 40 minutes on fresh tortillas. It's the item they brag on and not available. \nWe arrived at 2:30pm but full parking lot and lots of full tables. Fresh tortillas are the reason we venture out to authentic Mexican. \nTacos were ok. Enchilada was wonderful.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent Mexican food. Well prepared and served with ride in this authentic restaurant. Presentation as well as atmosphere are only outdone by the quality drinks, food and service.\nDon't miss the pride of El Mirage. It is simply the best!\nRB\n\n\n\n\n\nWe dined at this restaurant during a $2 margarita night.  The service was slow and the food was mediocre.  I have a feeling that the huge crowd draw revolved around the cheap drinks. I did not find this to be anything special and quite honestly I would rather pay more for my drink and have better food. The atmosphere was a little shabby as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe met at this restaurant with our friends. It was half way for both. It was on a Sunday and very, very, very nosiy. But should have known as alot of people are out on Sunday after Church. Food was okay, nothing to write home about. My order was wrong, instead of the Taco I got a tamale. The tamale was sweet and to much masa, very little filling. Really could not tell what was in it. The Chili Relleno was good. not much breading wtih some fire in the chili. Rice and Beans were so, so. We were a party of five and tho I did not check with the rest, I did notice food left on the plates. Margarita was excellent. Will we go again. Of course. Can not judge a place by the first visit. Salsa needs work. I refer to it as \"Gringo Salsa\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI only have one warning about this restaurant.  The food is so amazing that you cannot eat Mexican food anywhere else.  My wife had the shrimp fajitas which huge shrimp and were cooked perfectly.   I had chicken and beef enchiladas which had homemade corn tortillas and the most tender meat I had ever tasted.  Pair it up with the margarita special and I was a happy camper.  I will be a customer for life here!\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday's are fun and entertaining with the Mariachi band - they add to the atmosphere and the food is great !\n\n\n\n\n\nOur server, Mike, made an excellent recommendation, and  I highly recommend 'Carne Machaca Dinner' which is served with their home made flour tortillas - outstanding!  We nearly licked the plate after finishing the flan; some of the best ever. Friendly service, welcoming atmosphere. Family-friendly too. We'll be back, and hope to take advantage of their happy hour specials!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have come here every time I've gone to Arizona. So when my grandma recommended we go here for authentic Mexican food and margarita's I was super stoked.\n\nSadly this place blew it on every level. When we came in we were told it was a 5 minute wait. Instead we waited 15 minutes. I didn't really care because I was hungry. We were finally sat down and I realized it was so hot in the restaurant that I started sweating.  But I was so excited for the food that I looked past this.\n\nFinally the waitress came. She recognized my grandma and remembered her order. And took it. So then it came my turn to order so I tried to order my food and drinks. The waitress literally told me that she would not take my food order. I was super confused because she took my alcohol order but wouldn't give me food. I ended up getting a jumbo margarita on the rocks. So when the drinks came out everyone else got their drinks except me. I told the manager he questioned my age and then tried to card me again. So I ended up getting carded twice for a drink that took me 15 minutes to get!\n\nWhile we were waiting for our drinks and food I realized it literally took 30 minutes for them to clear a table. I don't know if they were short staffed or just did not care but the restaurant was messy and the staff was super rude.\n\nBy this time I was starving, sweaty, and drunk before she even decided to take my order. This waitress what the rudest person I have ever met! I ended up ordering the enchiladas del mas. Which was a seafood enchilada. In the past they were amazing. But this time it took 30 minutes to get my food. The tortillas were stale and tasted like cardboard. The fish and seafood were rubbery and the only thing that was good was the refried beans and rice. Seriously though, how hard is refried beans and rice. You can't mess that up!!! \n\nBy the end of the night I was drunk, sweaty and hungry. his was possibly the worst service I have ever gotten in my life. I have never gotten disrespected so much in a place I was a patron.\n\nIf my family hadn't gotten good service here and good food and drinks I would have complained to the manager. But since I was the only one who had an inedible meal I just left. You could not pay me to come back here. And I'm making it a point to tell the people of yelp about the horrible service I received here. DO NOT COME HERE.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this neighborhood location.  Their male servers are friendly & often remember us what we like to drink.  Makes us feel like a \"regular\".  They always keep us in chips & salsa, & so, we have some to take home.  We enjoy that & they offer our refill of our sodas/ tea innto-go cups.  Super great!  Just wish they could make crispier and double tortilla quesadillas & Mexican pizzas, especially since they have greatly increased their prices.  Love the fajitas!  Caution when ordering to go at the hostess counter.  The hostesses do not know the menu nor how to spell easy first names.  Husband asked for a burrito good for breakfast.  Instead of sh8wing him the choices of burritos or offering to make a custom egg, potato, & chorizo burrito, they sent him home with an aluminum container with beans, scrambled eggs & chorizo, and two tortillas, and some red sauce, & said that he could make his own burrito.  Had he been shown the other burritos available, he would have ordered a burrito already made.  He requested extra salsa & was given red sauce.  Just weird. Chips we're good, but, not enough salsa for the chips & the DIY burrito.  Usually, no problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been coming to Rio Mirage (the original location in El Mirage) for years.  The food here is really good and we've always had great service.  The service gets a little slow on Margarita Monday, but that is expected.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place! great mexican food, authentic mariachi band and awesome margis.... what's not to like?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had fond memories of this neighborhood restaurant when we lived in Surprise. Our return was disappointing. In fairness, we arrived just after the crest of the SunCity surge. The dude at the bar was great, while we waited for a table, churning out one marguarita after another.  The Cadillac marguarita was good but not likely to cause many dui's.   We had always been seated in the smaller back room in the high booths. Tonight we got a table in the front room which was \"bright\" to the point my ears hurt.  The salsa is to die for. We used to buy it by the quart. Food was -  ummm. I had a relleno/taco plate. The relleno was way above average but the chicken taco was a lost cause. The lady's had the carne which had good flavor but chewy.  Half of it came home for Chuck. Our waiter, bless his heart worked his patoot off, of a little militarialistic manner. Took our orders quick, brought the food out quick, brought the check quick, even before the ladies could talk themselves into the flan. Then vanished.\nEsto no fue bueno.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond time here and both times the service and the food were great. The corn tortillas they use for the enchiladas have a nice texture. Overall the food is higher quality than most of the other Mexican restaurants in the valley\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen going to this place for over 10 years now, never had a bad  meal yet, don't expect to either. .... we visit there about once a month or when company comes to town and we want to treat them to a good mexican meal....\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious. We arrived at 5:00 on a Wednesday and it was packed. They were out of the yummy looking drinks they advertised and it took awhile to get served but the chips are hot and fresh and once we ordered, it was fast.  The food was yummy and the mango margarita was delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered the Chili Relleno combination platter. This combo also came with a taco and I went with the shredded beef taco. The platter was rounded out with the Rio Mirage Cafe's rice and beans. Ordered Guacamole as a side and shortly, was enjoying my meal at home. \nI really like the relleno they create here at the Rio Mirage Cafe. The batter is just right. Not to thick and not too eggy. The shredded beef taco was delicious also but you can see I only came for the relleno. \nThe Cafe Mirage can be difficult for some to find, I am in this group, they are located on the corner of Grand and Santa Fe just NW of Primrose, where the railroad tracks cross Grand in El Mirage.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot what it used to be.  This was the third time this season we ate there. Not sure why we returned as we encountered many problems. \nOn one occasion one of our group did not touch his entree after tasting. To their credit they took it off the bill. Other diners that night had just barely ok fare. \nOn second occasion we were told a vegetarian request could not \"be made tonight as it was too busy\".  This waiter continued to be downright rude several times!\nJust tonight (three strikes and you are out) I ordered the fajita taco salad and it arrived with cool steak not even warm. Had to send it back. On second attempt meat was hot if not good quality, shell was cold and not crisp and overall not good. The usually very tasty salsa seemed like overripe tomatoes dominated  very very disappointing.  It was Monday night and margaritas are only a dollar. First one was ok--half ice but as expected, second 3/4 ice and when tried from the straw was very salty.  Now I know it was salted on rocks but this was pretty bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious!!!!! Flavors were awesome. We had the guacamole to start and shared the mahi mahi tacos and the chili relleno and tamale combo. The tamale was a sweet corn. Best ever. Great great food!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWife and I stopped in for lunch this last visit and it will indeed be our last visit. We have been here a few times and it was kind of OK I guess but this last time was awful. We each tried to take one bite of our food and had to spit it out. It wasn't one thing, it was EVERYTHING that was wrong. My plate had sat under the broiler for some long it was still frying the tacos on the plate at the table. My wife's Carne Asada Chimchanga was A) not fried, B) mostly green peppers and onions and C) the meat that was there was so tough and over cooked you could not chew it. She dug threw it for one good bite and spit out everything she tried. The fish in my fish tacos were briquets from being so over cooked. $42 down the drain for lunch..... Thanks so much!\nThe iced tea and chips and salsa were very good. Always find something nice to say, right?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis used to be our favorite Mexican restaurant in Surprise but the last three times we ate here it was awful. We kept going back hoping it was a fluke but unfortunately it wasn't. Shredded beef tacos were terrible. The meat was a weird mushy texture and no flavor at all. I doused them in salt to get some flavor. Beans were dry and over cooked. Chips tasted old and stale. The salsa is different from when we first started going there. I could go on and on but really it was terrible. Not getting my money anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is hit or miss, last night was disappointed, best burrito on the menu, was way over cooked, asked for a pinch of cilantro on top, it comes looking like someone dropped a whole bag on top & he charged me, most of it I had to remove, probably won't go back, make server was very unfriendly, salsa is very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I loved this restaurant!!  The location was not an issue and was easy  to get to. The food was fresh, authentic, and delicious! Chips are made daily and the salsa was the best we have ever had. Portions are plentiful and most entrees include rice and beans, both which are very good. We will definitely be back to try other menu choices!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy mother took me here a while back and I finally wanted to write a review. Rio mirage, both locations, has really good Mexican food. My favorite thing on (or maybe off) the menu is the flaming Toritos. That's what you want to come for. On another note, I think it's really tired and old to age bash residents of sun city and sun city west. Show some respect.  What are you people?  15 years old?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis location is usually good with good food but last two times I've been here that have had inattentive wait staff. Waited on a table of people that came in after us\n  Luckily we were able to flag down Luis who salvaged us as a customer.  Just giving a heads up to this long time El Mirage restaurant to improve the attentiveness of all their wait staff. TRAINING opportunity. Thank You Jason\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in based on the reviews, glad we did!  The coyote margaritas are awesome, very nice flavors. Food wise, I had the Carne machaca  dinner which was also very good!  Service was great and friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy fiance and I so happened to stumble upon this place amongst Grand Avenue and residential homes. The parking lot was so full and the streets were crowded, but we are young so we decided to do the Arizona thing and romp in the dirt to park.\n\nWe arrived with friendly faces, the bartender was a lovely lady with a great sense of humor and good taste for margaritas! Our server was excellent and was a great conversationalist without being up in our faces. The restaurant was crowded with blue haired couples on the night out in the town with margaritas and smiles on their faces. \n\nWe ordered too much food, but glad we did so we could have left overs. The margaritas were yummy and they hit the spot. You have a choice of small, medium, and large...I say go with the large! \n\nWe ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was good, but I probably won't order it again. Then we had the posole (pozole) which was to die for! They make it with beef...which I am not use to but...wow..what a great soup. I am a menudo fan so for those of you who cannot stomach menudo (pun intended) then try their posole. Plus, the soup comes with tortillas that are homemade and they are the best tortillas that I have had in Arizona!! My great-aunt might have to do a tortilla off with this place! \n\nThen we topped our meal with enchiladas del mar with imitation crab meat. It was tasteful, but I think I will come again and try something else. In the end we loved the service, the mariachi band, and the food and drinks are not stained with chain restaurant after taste but seemed to be made from the heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food and service aren't terrible, but like so many unfortunate restaurants this one suffers from being bland. I'm about as white as you can get, and I'm not into food that's so spicy you can't eat it, but at least throw in some spices to your food.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here with my boyfriend, we have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant on this side of town. As you know, there aren't many. This place hit it out of the park. Walking in it is clean, bright and inviting. The staff is friendly and non intrusive. Beverages were filled and chips and salsa were flowing. The chips are those thin, light freshly fried kind that no one makes anymore. The salsa was fresh, not too spicy, a little heavy on the tomato. I like a little more onion and garlic in mine. That didn't slow me down from emptying 3 bowls of it! I had the mahi-mahi tacos with fresh slaw and pineapple relish. The fish was moist and flavorful and the corn tortillas were almost buttery. Margaritas are delightful!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went at the height of the dinner rush on Friday.  We wanted something different outside of Surprise and this was just what we were looking for.  The place was packed.  Lots of retirees and locals it appeared.  I would give the Rio Mirage (3.5)  4 Stars overall since there is not an option for halves.   \n\nAmbience: 4 stars!  The  Rio Mirage was a nice old school mexican restaurant with plenty of seating.  Very well kept and clean. I also noticed that there was patio seating which looked comfy.  I would like to sit out there next time on a nice night.   We also loved the roaming mariachi band.  That was a nice touch and the kids loved them.  Lastly,  another note...when and if you try this place, you may expect to wait to be seated, but rest assured you won't go thirsty.  The bartender is stationed right next the entrance and the margaritas are pretty tasty.  I upgraded to the ulitmate, to get a splash of grand marnier.  3 stars on the margaritas.\n\nFood: I give the food 4 stars.   My wife ordered the fish tacos, which looked great. Fried white fish and shredded cabbage on a corn tortilla.  She gave them 2 thumbs up.   The kids had the \"Kid's Taco\" meal,  which came with a choice of beans.  They devored most of thier meals.  Their tacos were fried with shredded beef, lettuce & tomatoes.    I had the El Bombero Picado.  Strips of asada steak, covered in a green sauce with sauted peppers and onions.   It was real tasty, but was not as spicy as the menu was leading on.   However, real good.  My meal came with rice and beans on the side and a choice of tortillas.  I chose the \"homemade\" flour tortillas, 2 large tortillas (equivalent to 4 regular sized).  They were awesome.   My meal was great, I would just make a note to have them exclude the melted cheese on my beans next time.  It was a little \"overkill\" , but not a dealbreaker.  I just scraped the cheese off and it they were set.  The rice was nice and fluffy,  real subtle, with a great flavor.\n\n\nService: 2 stars.  I am giving our server the benefit of the doubt, SIMPLY because she was very friendly and helpful when we did get her attention.   She just seemed very overwhelmed and maybe she was having an \"off night\", which may likely led her to forget my tortillas after asking her twice.  Lol!  Once I get the \"homemade\" tortillas...muy bien as mentioned above.  Everyone else seemed to be getting served promptly and had smiles on their faces, which was a plus.  \n\nOverall,  I would recommend this place.  It is worth your time to try.  Remember,  avoid the rush and tell them to hold the cheese on the beans!  Good luck!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unfortunate bad experience. We stopped for lunch and ordered a caldo de res and a carne asada. \nThe caldo was so salty we could not eat it. The Carne asada y as a tough cut of meat without any flavor. Tortillas we're hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n4 stars on yelp? Really?\nService was very slow. \nBooth seats uncomfortable.\nNo Horchata or Agua frescas.\nWe split the mahi mahi taco plate.\nFish was very dry and I have a doubt that it was mahi mahi. Probably Talapia. No taste!\nThe only bright spot was the chips and salsa.\nNeedless to say, we won't be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was Great! The drinks were even better! And the Mexican pizza was better than I expected.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOVE this place, BEST Mexican food in the Valley and the bonus is.... the entire staff are so accommodating, they make you feel like you are the only one in the restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should have known when the menu offered pumpkin flavored margaritas.  Very poor food quality...Not real guacamole, the carnitas were so dry, and the special margarita with mango pure had to be sent back.  When we were leaving at 8:30 they had already brought out the mop and started cleaning the floors. Not restaurant we would recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ordered the buffet, the food was not very good and almost cold. The waiter we had did not say a word to us after taking our drink order, overall I'd say to avoid the buffet it, it was a waste of money.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Service. Enjoyed the chimichanga, which was with shredded beef and delicious.   Someone else at our table had the beef enchiladas and enjoyed them as well.  Great salsa with chips as well.\nThe location was hard to find the first time but now that I've been there, it is easier.  Parking can be hard, but you can park on the street with no problem.  Get there early for no wait during dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably my favorite Mexican dinner place in Surprise. All food is fresh hot tasty... it beats all the rest\n\n\n\n\n\n2 weeks ago we were here with a group and the service was awful. Tonight the service was great and the food and margaritas are always good\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food \nGreat service \nThe hostess is very nice\nClean restaurant \nClean bathroom \nVery friendly place to eat at.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly came in to pick up some of their homemade tortillas. One word, meal. I could eat an entire dozen just for dinner. Add a margarita and I'm done. Gotta try those tortillas!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a great time at the Mother's Day Buffet on Sunday.  It wouldn't have possible without our excellent server \"Cecee\" who got us a great table for our party of four. \nThe food selection was EXCELLENT just like the Service from our server!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food and nice servers, but extremely slow! It is slow every time, but we come back for the food, it's great!\n\n\n\n\n\ngreat food and great service.  I accidently came upon this while starving for lunch.  what a find.\nvery nice, helpful and friendly staff.  lots of menu selection and very good food.\njust wish they had Chile Verde on the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nTook my wife and a couple of friends there for the first time and all four of us loved our dish. It's got a nice setting, the service is great, and there was a mariachi playing for tips, which I thought was pretty cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fajita burrito and The Rio especial burrito are stuffed full of cooked onions with very little meat and at a cost of $14 a piece I find it very rude. The menu said topped with enchilada sauce but the entire plate was soaking in it. The rice was super dry and inedible. The salsa is good and drink prices are ok but they need to find a different burrito maker. Such an expensive disappointment for my birthday dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalked in and was looked at by 2 employees, stood there for a few minutes then watched as the server took a phone call while looking at me, then put her finger up in the (universal sign for hang on) Amazingly, continued on to the couple that had walked in about 90 sec after me an proceeded to help them. I was a single person nust looking to grab a bit to eat... Hey ownership, I'm new to the area and lookikg for a place to spend my money, it wont be with you.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I moved to Arizona from Chicago 3 years ago, I thought I would find the best Mexican  food ever.  But I soon learned all Mexican food is not created equal.  Thank goodness for Rio Mirage Cafe.  It fulfilled my dreams of wonderful flavored beans and rice, warm tortillas, fresh made salsa and the best fajitas ever.  And did I mention the 99 cent frozen Margaritas (Monday special)?  The tortilla chips and salsa are so good, it's a \"can't stop eating them\" experience.  And at Rio Mirage  the baskets and bowls are kept filled.  The sizzling plate of steak fajita so delicious and so much, certainly more than enough for 2 people so most of it when home to be enjoyed again tomorrow.  The service was great.  We were a group of 17, with separate checks for everyone and Juan C, our server, was kept busy.  Head to Rio Mirage if you're in the mood for wonderful Mexican food where you are welcomed when you arrive and thanked when you leave.  And did I mention the 99 cent Monday frozen Margaritas?  Delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\nCute building and festive interior.  Friendly staff from the instant you walk in the door.  You kinda feel like friends coming to visit and having a delicious meal!  Food was really good!  We left happy and full.  Will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm only giving them 3 stars because the service was so bad. We've been coming her for about 5 years. The food is always good, the margaritas are great. Monday night we were celebrating 3 birthdays. Because we were having a large group we made a reservation a few days in advance. When we arrived, we had to wait 15 minutes for our table to be ready.  Once we were seated, we waited another 15 minutes  for a waiter. They weren't that busy and seemed to have plenty of staff. When our waiter finally got there, he asked If we were ready to order. We said we wanted to order for drinks. He was rude. He wasn't happy that we asked for separate checks. We had to flag him down for water refills and another round of drinks. I don't know what's going on there but we're all locals and i would think they would want our business in the summer. We won't go back for awhile\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the best mexican food I have ever eaten! Everything was fresh and so tasty! The service was great too! I just moved to Arizona a couple of months ago and this restaurant is by far in the top 5 of my new favorite places to eat. I practically cleaned my plate. I ordered the cheese crisps for the appetizer. So yummy! I also got the enchiladas del mar and it was so flavorful! I would highly recommend this place. I know you won't be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I don't think there is a river or a mirage anywhere near this place, there does always seem to a large puddle of water in the parking lot. At least I think there is, unless, it's a mirage. Hmmm...What isn't a mirage is a restaurant full of local Latino families and a sea of blue haired, varicose veined, AARP folks from Sun City. I should know. Cuz my Sun City living mom and dad love Rio Mirage. This is where me and mom let loose and bond over a couple margs. While dad sips his ice tea and flirts with the waitress. I've had good luck ordering the same thing here. Carne Asada with beans and tortillas. I kinda put the steak in the tortilla, roll it up with some fixins. Chew. Smile. Chug more margarita. Mom loves the grilled quesadilla and dad's finicky ordering style is accommodated with \"ground beef tacos. Hard. Nothing fancy.\" We always get great service and I love the local vibe. And the margarita buzz gets me through an entire game of bridge with Big Daddy and Momma Jo!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe locals favorite Mexican restaurant for sure.  Best salsa and chips in town and the prices are reasonably especially from their lunch menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was FANTASTIC! Everyone's food was fantastic, but I like burritos and they have this burrito(El Rico) that is slightly fried so the tortilla is a little bit crispy, then you add in poblano peppers, steak, cheese, onions, and mushrooms, and you get the best burrito I have ever eaten! The service is excellent and the food comes out relatively quick so you dont have to wait forever to eat!\n\nWe were also blessed to go on a Friday night, where there is a mariachi band that will play right to the table! What a great experience and my mouth is still bursting with flavor from eating here.\n\n\n\n\n\nA mixed crowd from Surprise & Sun City. Crowded but quick, efficient service.  Everybody loved their food... Guacamole was fresh and very good. The chicken & spinach enchiladas were yummy!!!! \n\nI would definitely come back if in the area and might even drive from the other side of town for the incredibly delicious specialty Watermelon margarita drink (can't remember what it was called).\n\nI think the guac and the enchiladas were described as \"spicy\" - I did ask the server about it as I'm a whimp and neither were spicy... So not sure if he adjusted or if you should order extra spicy if that's how you prefer it. Parking lot is tiny and you have to back out if it's full... Unless you can see that there is a spot, I'd just park along the street/railroad tracks.  \n\nCharming patio... Wish this was in my neighborhood...\n\n\n\n\n\nOmg this was one of the worst experiences I ever had in a restaurant,  to start the lady at the front desk kept repeating her self that the restaurant was closing in 45 minutes , she turn around 2 Mexican families away, and then at 746 a White family shows up and guess what? They get an option of get there meals to go, unbelievable!  Its all about them apparently ...there is clear tables in the back of the restaurant but there are not longer available because is closing Time.  This manager in Duty is not in control,  the employees are... hahaha I'm a facility manager my self and this crew should be ashamed of there selfs .. one of the server's comes out and screams NO MoRE! ..I don't want nothing free I'm just gonna use my Christmas gift card and let my customers and friends know about the service on this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have eaten here once, and the experience was great. This definitely is a hidden gem in El Mirage. We just moved to the area recently, so we will be going back to this restaurant soon. Hopefully our next trip is just as nice.\n\nIt is a bit noisy but nothing that bothers me. I have 2 kids so I prefer the noise. If you're looking for a quiet intimate dinner then this probably wouldn't be the place.\n\nThe service was a teeny bit slow but it was packed, so that's understandable. The food was worth it. I got the tacos Mexicanos and it was delicious. The tortillas are excellent, I could eat them plain! So yummy. The food is a bit greasy but I've never gone to this style of mexican restaurant without having greasy food. It kind of comes with the territory.\n\nWe will be coming back for happy hour soon. I'm so glad we found this place! I recommend that you at least try it out, as there's not much else to choose from if you live in El Mirage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a 5-Star neighborhood gem. It serves excellent Sonoran Mexican food, fresh tortillas, flavorful salsa & chips, tasty 99 cent Margaritas (on Mondays) all by very friendly servers. \nThe beef fajita salad is really tasty, their salsa is some of the best, the food comes fast and hot.\nAnd a big plus, the Carnitas plate is back for our winter season (see photo). I took half of it home there was so much!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family & I have been coming here for almost 5 years. We've never had a bad experience. Discount Margarita nights are the best & my kids love the Mariachi band on the weekends. They opened a new one in Surprise, but it's not the same. The original is the best . If your on the fence to try it or not, give it a chance you won't be disappointed!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason why I did not rate as 5 stars was the very slow end service. It took 20 minutes for the waiter to pick up the payment and cash us out. Otherwise the food was great! I will be returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I know what you're thinking... \"this guy leaves a lot of 5 star reviews\"... Damn right I do!!  Because the places I choose are either based off Yelp or word of mouth recommendations.\n\nAnyways, back to the review... When we visit my parents in Surprise we usually hit up Macayos... that day is done!  My wife and I agreed that Rio Mirage is added to our Phoenix Bucket List (along with In N Out and Don Pancho's).  Their food was fantastic!  I also tried their habenero salsa and it melted my face off, I had to slam 3 frozen margs till I got the sensation back in my head.  Well done Rio Mirage!  Our server rocked and as I looked around their authentic atmosphere everyone working there was busting their asses off!!  It was great to see.   My burrito was muy grande and bursting with deliciousness! \n\nI can't wait to come back for more!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm from NM and it's very hard to find good \"New\" Mexican food in AZ.  I'm not a fan of Tex Mex. I love sauces, hatch green chile and posole.   Rio Mirage is a great place to enjoy some good Mexican food in Surprise, AZ.    The atmosphere is phenomenal and the buffet offers just about everything you can imagine and some!   The service is outstanding and the food is great!!  You will get your monies worth by ordering a plate or enjoying the buffet.   I wouldn't recommend the Rio Mirage on Bell and Litchfield.   This location is 100 times better for some odd reason. The food, atmosphere and customer service just isn't the same on Litchfield.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy sister and brother-in-law have taken me to this place several times during my visits from San Diego.\nAtmosphere is truly what one would expect from a Mexican Restaurant and the people working there welcome you at the door. A lady makes the tortillas right there to order.\nI always have the chimichanga and it is fabulous.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice little hole in the wall. Took awhile to find it but it was worth it. Their silver margaritas were good, not too strong though. We had their rolled quesadillas with steak which were very tasty. Not fancy but good eats in a cozy environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a hidden gem. We had a very nice dinner on the patio (minus the mosquitos) and our service was fantastic. The manager made rounds that seemed timely and appropriate...while our server was very attentive and went above and beyond. The food was great too! Seemed very fresh!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been here a few times.  The first few times the food and service were fine.  This last time Thursday evening the food and service were awful.  The waiter  came to take our drink order.  He was not able or willing to answer any questions and was openly inpatient.  I got a giant margarita that was very good. The reason for the two stars.  We both ordered beef fajitas.  The meat was tough and tasteless.  We were very disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nGot super sick from the pollo fundido burrito.   Was throwing up all night long.    Gave me horrible food poisoning.    Won't ever be back and sad I wasted $40 in horrible Mexican food\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved everything. The salsa , the beans, the service, the ambiance, the food, the portions. I tend to be a bit picky about Mexican food.  The parking lot was packed when we arrived at 8 pm and it's an odd location. I finally found a restaurant I'll go back to time and again.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere was fun. Service was spectacular. Fare was less than fair. \n\nYet another gringo-gone-bad Mexican restaurant. I've HAD good bad Mexican, if that makes sense, but I can't understand why Mexican restaurants must insult the potential of the American palate! Maybe most rural Americans DO expect and desire bland, fatty, cheesy, fried foods served in embarrassing gigantic portions, but given the chance, with truly traditional Mexican cuisine, they might cultivate a different taste profile and expectation. The subtlety needs to be explored. \n\nAs I said, I enjoyed the space (kitschy as it was), and the service was prompt Bd friendly, but too bad I had to try and eat there! \n\nPROXIMO!\n\n\n\n\n\nLOVED the food at this place.  No doubt I'll make a trip back when I'm in town again.  Bonus points for having a habanero salsa option, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery single time I have ordered to go, I have waiting at the desk for at least 15 minutes while staff try to figure out where my order is. Last time, I had to wait for the person that actually took the order to get my food and they couldn't find her. One would think the food would be back in the kitchen. The food here is good but the long wait for to go orders and the fact that they now limit their $1 margaritas on Monday to 2 is why it received the lower rating. The management tried explaining that they limit them to 2 for legal purposes but when questioned how many large margaritas I could order at full price, he said as many as I wanted. So, they are not so much concerned about drinking and driving (I've always taken an uber there), the bottom line is trying to lure customers in with the $1 margarita and then telling them they can only have 2 after they have sucked the second one down. I was recently there (again, I said the food was good) and received excellent service from a blonde headed waitress whose name I cannot remember. I've always gotten good service while seated but she gave exceptional service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was just ok. \n\nWe were invited here for dinner and our friend who invited us loved it, and she paid, so i kinda feel bad that i didn't like it half as much as she did.  We had a GREAT time with our friend and that's what matters here.  \n\nThe first thought we had when we walked in was,  \"Where are all the locals?\"  It made me think that there must be a better place for authentic Mexican food. I think i was right. I want to find THAT place and go eat. \n\nMy carne asada was bland and colorless. The meat didn't have that char or defined grill marks that add so much flavor. It had more of a steamed light brown look and didn't have much  flavor at all.  I was disappointed. \n\nThe chips were good and light and not too oily. The homemade tortillas were good. \n\nThe bar area,  isn't really a bar area.   there were a few high top tables between the front door and the bar but there was no defined area for the bar seating.  We had people sitting in chairs waiting to be seated right behind and next to us.  It was pretty awkward.  \n\nThe margaritas were marginal and not freshly mixed. They were super weak and poured from a pitcher. Again,  dissapointed. \n\nI want authentic Mexican food where the locals go. Not just a place where others think the locals will go.  This resturant was in predominately residential area without the local demographic representation. What I mean to say is that there seemed to be a lack of Mexican and Hispanic patrons in here.  Where were they and where are they eating?  That's where I want to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is probably tied with another Mexican restaurant on Dysart and Thunderbird as my least favorite Mexican food joint. Maybe it was just me, but they didn't have a wide variety to choose from. Also, everything I asked the waiter about was \"hot.\" I realize it's a Mexican restaurant and that type of food is usually spicy, but give us spice fearing gringos some wiggle room! I was going to get a chimichanga but figured that if I was going to pay $13.95 for something I could easily get for $6 at one of the fast food Mexican joints I would just pay a buck more and get fajitas. I got the chicken fajitas and they were NOT good. It seriously tasted like how my garbage smells. It was gross. Plus, the pico was put onto the hot plate with the meat. Hot pico=not good. The salsa and chips were delicious though, as was the guacamole. Our server was very nice, but not very attentive at all. He took about 15 minutes to come back and take our order after getting us our drinks. Then he said he'd get us more chips. Yeah, never happened. I still tipped 20% because, like I said, he was very nice and seemed like he meant well. They just seemed over busy and understaffed. That's not the waiter's fault. Even though the chips and salsa were great, I will not be back. Ever. The price is way too high for what you get.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved everything about this place. Ambiance was awesome, shrimp tacos were to die for and the service was awesome. Will come back next time we're in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf-priced margaritas on Saturdays? WOO HOO! \n\nWe've taken our family here for dinner, maybe 10-12 times over the past 9 years. That doesn't really represent how much we like the food; we're just usually shuttling around other parts of town. \n\nSo here's what to like: \n1. Consistently good Mexican food. From their standard combos to the chef's selections, everything we've tried on the menu has been really good. Yum! \n2. Chips & salsa until the cows come home. And it's really fresh salsa with super-tasty, hot chips in a bottomless bowl. Yum! \n3. Fresh tortillas, hot off the press. You can even buy a dozen for about $4... it seems pricey until you taste 'em. Yum! \n4. My little chitlins actually eat the rice and beans here. Nowhere else. Weird, eh? \n5. Did I mention half-priced margaritas... on SATURDAY?? We got their jumbo-sized house margaritas for $4. Even better, the bartender did not have a light hand. The worst part was deciding who got to drink, and who had to stay sober to drive... lol \n6. VERY reasonably priced. Dinner for five, with alcohol, was under $70, including tip... AND we had leftovers. \n7. Their whole menu is available to-go. Score! \n8. Friendly, efficient staff. I've never had to wonder where our meals, drinks or bill were, and everyone is smiling and courteous. BIG plus in my book. \n9. Mariachi music... ole! \n\nNot so great: \n1. Yeah. It's right by Sun City, which means a lot of golden oldies. More power to them, though, as they appear to lap up those margaritas like water. Just wish they weren't driving after... :/\n2. The parking lot ain't great. This place can fill up, making parking only possible across the road... next to the railroad tracks. Meh. \n\nSo based on my scientific analysis above, this place is a good value for a great, casual Mexican dining experience. Great spot to hit, on the way to/from the lake or Vegas, or if you're a local!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat drinks (get the strawberry margarita!)  and delicious food! The bathroom was disgusting though and the parking lot is kind of hard to get to... otherwise, it was a nice dinner spot! Our waitress/bartender was sweet, too!\n\n\n\n\n\nA local favorite around here. This was one of the first places we ate at when we moved into the neighborhood. The food is tasty with a very large selection of items. Their pricing seems to be in par with mainstream mexican food restaurants even though you would expect it to be cheaper as it appears to be more of a \"mom and pop\" kind of place. \n\nThey have a small cantina where you can come and sit down in and enjoy a very cheap but very tasty margarita. They even have $.99 margs on mondays. \n\nWe've come back multiple times and each time have had a pleasant experience each time. The best part, it's practically walking distance.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen going here 10 years plus \nWe always have great food and service \n2 locations\nSurprise and El Mirage \nEl Mirage is the best\nOld school Mexican and always spot on\n\n\n\n\n\nVery fine restaurant, great food and service I would eat there again hoping they would redeem my happy hour margarita coupon for a first time visitor.  Waiter was very polite and attentive however he completely ignored my coupon.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time ever going to this place,  have drove past it thousands of times over the years.  Must say that it is a shame it took this long to find. \n\nVery good food and large portions make it that much better. Will definitely be a regular place to go.\n\nService was also good\n\n\n\n\n\nA true mexican delight. We go here most of the time, when closed we head out to the sister location.\nRio Mirage is the go to destination to bring visitors, large groups of friends and just lunch or dinner with family and the friends who first introduced me to the yummiest ever traditional mexican food.\nThis is a must try for a special occasion or a Prickly pear margarita and lunch, or just because your hungry,\nThe wait staff is attentive, warm and friendly, the restrooms extremely clean as is the rest of the restaurant.\nSunday brunch is fantastic, I always enjoy trying dishes here that I may not have tried elsewhere. Never have I been dissatisfied. The portions are huge and  the Flan is amazing.\nWhen closed we head out to Surprise location and enjoy everything equally as much.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall the experience was great! As me and a friend walked in, we were greeted with a smile. The atmosphere felt like we were in Mexico and the band playing only added to the experience! They were very enjoyable to listen to! The food was tasty, especially the retried beans and guac. I recommend you visit if you're in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrunch food is cold, didn't get drinks refilled once. But the homemade tortillas are soooo good!!! As are the churros... Not having drink specials for brunch probably won't bei g me back to this place...\n\n\n\n\n\nNice atmosphere and very good food. Busy on Mondays. Parking is tight but worth a short walk. Authentic Mexican. Will go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Surprise location is our normal stop, and we have always enjoyed eating there. But we have always heard how good their El Mirage location was. So luckily we were nearby on a Sunday. As it turns out, it was brunch. Many different options from their brunch buffet. However you can still order from their menu. \nI had eggs, green chili, beans, rice, and their homemade tortilla. Made right there in their facility. I had other items during the time I was there, just not going to embarrass myself and list it all.  Their food was great, been a long time since I have been at a brunch. Forgot how much I liked it. Service was great, greeted with a smile and they came by all the time to check on us. \nThis location does have a different atmosphere then the Surprise location. I seemed to enjoy it more there. Had a great time, and we'll be back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent for lunch, but  I'm sure dinner would be even better.  Nice happy hour specials.  The hostess was phenomenal!!!  Very profesional going the extra mile.  This is a family run establishment worth supporting.\nThe short rib dish with vegetable - delicious.  The refred brand ohhhh so good.  As well as the specialty burrito.\nLook forward to trying there margaritas next time we visit.  Plenty of parking.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food and very authentic. Service was good and quick.\n\nAsk for the hot sauce but beware it has a little kick to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the good location. Awesome food. Friendly & warm atmosphere. They have a mariachi band!!! made me smile. :-):-):-)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chips were so-so but the salsa was very good. The house margarita was yummy. And the Burrito de Fajita was AMAZING!!!", "useful": 0.9636363636363636, "cool": 0.22727272727272727, "funny": 0.2636363636363636, "date": "2016-03-05 23:12:53"}, "9": {"business_id": "-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw", "business_name": "China Farm Chinese Buffet", "address": "3135 S 48th St", "attributes": "{'RestaurantsAttire': \"u'casual'\", 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Alcohol': \"u'none'\", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'Ambience': \"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}\", 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'WiFi': \"u'free'\", 'NoiseLevel': \"u'average'\"}", "categories": "None", "city": "Tempe", "hours": "{'Monday': '11:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-20:0'}", "postal_code": "85282", "review_count": 9, "stars": 2.5, "state": "AZ", "review": "I've been eating at this joint for 20+ years.  There are better Chinese restaurants in town but  they do a lot of things good enough to stay on my list of regular places to visit.  CF is your typical small Chinese Buffet hole in the wall.  This food is above average and worth a visit for a quick lunch if you are in the neighborhood or passing through the area. Several things that I think the do GREAT are the Kung Pao Chicken, Wings and Smoked Fish (Fridays only).  Their Kung Pao is the best I've ever had hands down bar none !  The flavor in their recipe is just perfect.  Also they have great wings.  They are not the typical \"hot wings' just breaded and fried chicken wings.  Their coating on the wings is so good you could open and chicken joint just on that recipe alone.  Think KFC crunchy but with the flavor of original KFC and you'll come close to what their wings taste like.  And last but not least...smoked fish on Fridays.  I have to admit at first 20 years ago it was not something I cared for but for the last 10 years it has grown on me and now I get a craving for their fish at least once a month and have to visit them on Fridays.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother one of those cheap Chinese buffets (5.95) that puts out a few tasty dishes that get you up to 3 stars.The decor sucks and the washrooms need to be torn out and rebuilt. On the brighter side I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I would return to this place because of the food, cheap price and the friendly staff , and to see if they remodeled it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! This place has turned a corner. Under new management  The food is outstanding and fresh, the price is right. You must check it out.  No tricks to force the food taste better, the staff is friendly, helpful. Try the Moo Goo Gai Pan, it is outstanding. And their Beef w/Broccoli where the beef is well cooked and seasoned not rubbery and the Broccoli is cooked and crunchy.  New modern furniture and a flat screen tv. We'll be back, for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has definitely changed for the better! I had visited here a while back and remember the food as being mediocre and the decor was just horrible and cheap. Today I called for take out for the first time in quite a while. When I walked in I was shocked, there's a new name and the whole restaurant has been completely redone! It looks wonderful! The staff is very friendly, they kept thanking me for calling and telling me they hope that I would enjoy the food. When he told me my total for two lunch specials, and egg drop soup, and some fried wontons, I was shocked! Only $12?!  With this in mind, I was still expecting the same mediocre food....it was WONDERFUL! The egg rolls were nice and crispy, the sweet and sour sauce tasted great, and most of all the chicken lo mein was to die for. It had plenty of vegetables in it and even water crescents which I feel like are left out of a lot of dishes these days! I was really impressed by the service and the food. I'll definitely not take so long to come back this time around.  The new management has helped this place quite a bit. I've tried just about every Chinese place in Tempe and this is definitely my winner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food and customer service were literally worse than I have ever experienced in my entire life! \n\nI went for dinner around 4:30pm on a Saturday. Nearly all of the trays on the buffet were empty. What was left was cold, but I didn't know that until it was on my plate. When I got back to my table I had a bite of orange chicken, which was stone cold. The white rice was hard and cold. I pushed my plate to the side while I debated what to do. One of the waitresses came over and asked if I'd like a drink refill, even though I had only drunk about a third of the glass of soda. I declined and explained that my guest and I were going to be leaving because the food was horrible, but it would be great if we could get a refund. Laney came over and said she'd refund half, but later agreed to refund me for both my meal and my guest's meal, which was as cold and stale as mine. When she came back, Laney presented me with a new receipt for $4, citing that there was nothing wrong with the sodas we ordered. While that was true, I explained I believed that was horribly petty since my guest had drunk none of his soda and I had so little of mine -- and the point of the drinks were to enjoy them with our meals. The man, whom I assume to be Laney's brother, came over and was very apologetic, refunded all of my money and offered to cook us fresh food  free of charge to learn how good his fresh cooking was (We declined.), but he didn't seem to think there was a problem with having cold and stale food on the buffet line. \n\nLong story short, I think that China Farm uses quality ingredients and may very well produce good food when cooked to order, but don't count on getting an edible meal at the buffet. The orange chicken was all white meat and the beef and broccoli my guest had was made with quality looking beef and vegetables ... just cold.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust your average Chinese buffet, maybe a little small.  There were the basics that you'll find just about anywhere - everything was just about the same.\n\nNothing really jumped out, but things were decent enough that I'd probably go back. One thing that does work in its favor - it's a couple dollars cheaper than a lot of buffets out there.\n\n\n\n\n\nGot yelled at by the delivery guy for not putting my apartment number on my online order. My computer auto-filled my address, so it is my fault not for double checking, but he called to get the unit number. On the phone he gave me a bunch of attitude, then he gets here and reads me the riot act again.  \n\nFood: B-. Prices: C+. Customer service: F\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fried chicken wings are good.  The rest?  Below par Chinese MSG.  I might get some wings sometime, but the rest of the food is below mediocre.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't waste your time... Ick! It's already dry enough in Arizona, don't think we need our food like that too...", "useful": 1.3333333333333333, "cool": 0.4444444444444444, "funny": 1.0, "date": "2009-12-30 03:00:01"}, "10": {"business_id": "-2isRNVb6PDuBagELL5EBw", "business_name": "Taco Bell", "address": "3507 W.

I love the food and hate it when they get my order wrong! My bean burrito had some other \"bonus\" ingredients this time (a little beef and lettuce). I LOVE the Baja Blast Mountain Dew!! Hey Pepsi... did you guys put crack in the Baja Blast?? I wish I could buy it off the shelf, but alas I guess I'll continue to brave Taco Bell for my fix!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is gonna be what the food is gonna be, you know that.\nSo I judge a FFchain on a few things.\nIs it clean.\nAre they friendly.\nDo they fahqew in the drive thru?\n\nThis Taco Hell scores consistently mediocre on all counts, except that they are quite friendly.\n\nIt is refreshing to pull into the drive thru, and even if there were a line of cars ahead of you, to hear the mechanical voice in the box say, \n\"Hi, How are you?\"\n...and then pause for an answer!\n\nThey do it all the time, so must be made to say it, but it always seems sincere.  It catches you off guard at first, but now I have grown to really dig the tone it conveys.  I don't think that the couple of seconds it may delay the order is a big deal at all, compared to the warm fuzzy feelings I get when I respond, \n\"I'm fine. How are you?\"...and get a genuine response back.\n\nI'm not here that often, but more since they demolished the Del Taco across the street to build a CVS freestanding location (good call, since the strip mall CVS in that shopping ctr is gross).\n\nI have noticed that there are several employees that seem to have stuck around and worked here for well over a year, maybe two -- good sign when you're judging a FFchain, since turnover = non-caring employees.\n\nSo in summary:\nIt's clean enough.\nThey're quite friendly.\nThey haven't yet fahq'd me in the drive thru.\n\nEdited:\n\nMeh for food.\nYay! I'm a fan for friendliness.\n\nAccording to my personal rating system that's much too complicated to show here, this equates to an A-OK overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's really sad and disappointing that my house is near this location. I've been let down too many times. Whether it be meat on the vegetarian taco I ordered, or they give me fire when I asked for hot. \nBut today my complaint is with the manager that was working tonight. 9/3/18 9:12pm. I ordered a triple layer nacho and asked if I could substitute the cheese sauce for shredded cheese. Normally an employee at a respectable establishment would let you know it would be $0.50 extra. But she didn't. So I asked about the price difference. She said yes it's extra. I was confused because I was not getting any extra cheese, just wanted a different kind. Again, normally, especially a manager, the person would say you know what don't worry about it I'll get that made the way you want no extra charge. But no, I didn't get that response so I just ordered it the way it comes. I think ALL of the employees at this location need some work on their customer service, if this is the way a manager treats the customer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey used to exceptional service! Now they lack in that and are lazy with there with build. Today I just in with my dad and got the new nacho stuft box and they didn't even get it right. And all their sour cream smelled like bleach. They need to wash their hands more often. They broke all my taco shells and it's just crazy hopefully they hire on new staff. The dinner crew today were just terrible.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a Taco Bell so if your expecting a detailed review on their menu look elsewhere. It's the same shit they are serving at all the other locations. \nReview is on the customer service.\nSuper nice and friendly staff that goes above and beyond. I come here occasionally but always drive thru. Is it only me that seems to always get their drive thru order wrong?? This is the only place that has always got it right.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor being a regular at this Taco Bell, I've never experienced any bad customer service. Everyone that works here is very professional & really nice. \n\nMy friends & I came to the drive-thru this past Monday night, and Juanita who was working the window was so awesome! Great attitude & vibe. Thanks Juanita!\n\n\n\n\n\nI got home, and my Chalupa's were completely cold! Like, literally cold! I had to heat them up myself. I also asked for double meat in my burrito supreme and my chicken taco, and did not receive either. I go here all the time, and I always have issues. So this time I decided to complain.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow, dirty inside, employees are cussing to each other. At least the food was good but experience not so much.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food sucks but I buy it because I go for the Strawberry fruitista which are SOOOO good.  But this month they blew in 3 times.  Machine broken, out of stawberries, machine frozen up. Guess I have to call before I go to make sure I can get a fruitista.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, first before anything, I want to address this is a Taco Bell so I'm not expecting 5 star service. And I want to give credit where credit is due, and say unlike many other locations, this one has never messed up an order. And I want to mention, I have ordered from both the fixed price menu and the value menu- in store and through the drive through. Whatever I order from the fixed price menu is fixed \"properly\" and by that I mean in comparison to the value items- which are anemic and obviously thrown together sloppily. The customer service could use some work as well when it comes to special orders. I have no problem paying more, they just seem to have an issue with it. The customer service I received was subpar and could use some work, especially the manager I saw today.\n\n\n\n\n\nI go to this Taco Bell every once in a while because it's close to home. For the most part my orders are always right, but my favorite part of this Taco Bell is Alani. She is so sweet, and so efficient. I never go inside the restaurant but I know the drive through is pretty fast. Today I had a problem with my order, I think it was hunger mixed with poor communication, but Alani fixed it as usual and tried to make me feel comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery clean. Including bathroom. Very courteous associates.\nWill be back here to eat in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is really a 2.5 star rating.\n\nAfter I picked my son up from school he asked for Taco Bell. It's cheap, he will eat it and I don't have to cook. Win, win...\n\nArrived at about 3:30 on a Monday. We opted to go inside because he did not know what he wanted. Big pet peeve when someone in front of me in the drive thru line has no idea and takes them 10 minutes to order.\n\nOne person in the dining room in front of us who obviously didn't get the right order was trying to correct it.\n\nA gentleman took our order who I believe was the manager. He was pleasant enough. We ordered a Dorito Gordita Big Box and upgraded the drink to a freeze since it was \"happy hour\". While we were waiting someone in the drive thru received the wrong order and someone that had already left came into the dining room with the wrong order.  Uh oh!\n\nWe waited about 5 minutes when a very rude young boy called out our order. I found it strange that he was trying to call my name which he clearly couldn't pronounce when I never gave Mr. Order Taker it.\n\nThankfully our order was correct.  Food was average Taco Bell. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing right either.\n\nWe continue to visit this location because we usually have a very nice lady by the name of Carol take our order and she gives us outstanding customer service.\n\nDining room appeared to be clean with drink station average. All sauces and napkins stocked.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here for a quick, cheap bite through the drive-thru, but the line was backed up, they were getting swamped. The employee in the window Carter offered a free drink or cinnamon twist for the wait. First time in awhile a drive-thru gave me customer service like that in a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Taco Bell food. However, I hate this location, because although they make your food very quickly, it lacks quality. Also out of all the times I've been here, I've received my burritos undercooked and still cold about half the time. They do a great job of fixing their mistakes, but if they would take a few extra seconds, this mistake wouldn't happen as often.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive through is so slow its ridiculous.  Won't come again.  But at least they gave me money off for the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis location has friendly service , and great food. To top it off , they have wifi. So stop writing hateful reviews everyone , gosh. Makes me so tired. Just enjoy the food and stop being jerks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis location is full of lazy people who don't like large orders. I tried to place an order for my office and was basically told no. Idk who they think they are but I'm an American and I want my tacos now.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent through drive thru and was asked by Jerimiah if I wanted sauce for my order. I stated hot and fire. He yook my card and when he reopened the window I said lots of got sauce, he said hot sauce and I said Yes. We got our order and there was no sauce at all in either bag. I waited till he open the window and stated he had given us no sauce. After he rolls his eyes, closes the window without saying a word. He finally comes back and gives me 5 packets. With the size of our order, that was insufficient. I pulled around and went into the the restaurant, I told the cashier ehat had occurred. No apology, no let me get my manager instaed he hands me a bag and said get what you want. So needless to say I will NOT ever visit your restaurants again in the future. And I will assure I tell every person I know about your horrible service and bad employees\n\n\n\n\n\nThat carol lady is beyond expectations when it comes to customer service! Every time I go in and see her I know I'm going to have a great time. Food is awesome as always !\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here the other night, my son was starving and it was late... normally I wouldn't even think to yelp review a Taco Bell, but the person working the drive thru window was SO nice, it was memorable and honestly refreshing to get service with a smile. Got home and the food was perfect.  Win-win for a midnight drive thru!\n\n\n\n\n\nI only come here once in a while, but I have received great customer service each time. It feels like the employees enjoy their job and enjoy helping their customers...even if its for a simple order of tacos. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"fast\" in fast food apparently doesn't apply here.  I was on my way home from work,  appx 9:30 Friday night. The drive thru was busy,  so I went inside.  I was one of 2 customers inside when I went,  and the other had already ordered before I arrived. There was no acknowledgement,  and it took forever to get my order (combo #2 - grilled stuft burrito and a taco).  I don't understand why it was so slow either. .. There were 5 employees just within my line of sight. As a matter of fact,  I've been able to type this entire review so far as I wait for my food... From a clumsy phone keyboard. I realize Taco Bell isn't typically considered fine Mexican cuisine,  but the service wasn't great,  even by their own standards.\n\nUpdate: I am going back and increasing this review to three stars, because even though the service wasn't the best, the food was good when I got it. I think this location has a lot of room for improvement though, at least on the service side of things.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's Taco Bell...A fast food chain...How anti-Yelp of me. I may even get a talk thread all about me as an example of all things wrong with Yelp..But I eat TB alot and frankly each deserves a different rating so why not give it a go? \n\nIf you need your fix of burrito with fillings from a caulking gun I would reccomend you drive to the next TB since they are on every corner and this one is sub par. My half pound cheesy bean burrito weighed nowhere near a half pound and while I can't figure out which layer was missing there were definately only 6 layers in my 7 layer burrito. \n\nThere is a Del Taco across the street; what was I thinking?\n\nOn the plus side when I say alot of fire sauce, I mean it and they complied.", "useful": 0.2916666666666667, "cool": 0.3333333333333333, "funny": 0.4166666666666667, "date": "2008-08-05 16:37:16"}, "11": {"business_id": "-34vSRcMz_RjN00dWIiQ3Q", "business_name": "Subway", "address": "5026 W Cactus Rd, Ste 2", "attributes": "{'Ambience': \"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}\", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': \"u'casual'\", 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}\", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'Alcohol': \"u'none'\", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': \"u'quiet'\", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'}", "categories": "None", "city": "Glendale", "hours": "{'Monday': '8:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '8:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '8:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '8:0-21:0', 'Friday': '8:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '8:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '9:0-20:0'}", "postal_code": "85304", "review_count": 16, "stars": 2.5, "state": "AZ", "review": "Extra charges for meat change on a BMT, only branch that try's to charge 75cents per 6 inch. Employees blame the owner, I will definitely never come back to this location.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came in for lunch today and got to chat the owner who recently bought this store. She was very pleasant and is working hard to make the store a nice place. Check it out and ask for Heidi.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally I couldn't fathom leaving such a negative review for a Subway as I quite enjoy eating fresh but I found this particular establishment to be most unsatisfactory.  It was relatively clean inside but there was no atmosphere whatsoever.  There was no music or anything, just utter silence.\n\nService was OK, two stars maybe,  but it was virtually impossible to understand the employees.   We gotta have some basic communication if we're going to do business.   Prices were definitely higher than other Subways and the veggies weren't especially fresh.  Food was acceptable but unmemorable and certainly lower quality than other locations.\n\nIf it were a small town and this was the only Subway, I guess it would be tolerable but this is Phoenix.  There's a Subway on every corner and I see absolutely no reason to visit this location ever again.\n\nClean up guys, tour other locations or something to see how it's done.   What you're doing isn't working at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nWish I could give them zero stars. The other reviews are spot on. They don't want your business. They refuse to honor Subway coupons. The employees act rude and condescending. Their prices are more expensive than other Subways in the area. I'd recommend the Subway at 51st and Olive if you're looking to eat at Subway in this neighborhood. Avoid this one at all costs!\n\n\n\n\n\nI wish I could give negative stars. This is BY FAR the worst subway I've ever been to. The staff is rude and rush you or just ignore anything that you're saying. I asked them to not toast my sandwich and got a long sigh and continued attitude. The vegetables were old and soggy and don't even try to ask them to take something wrong off because you'll get yet another sigh and another full dose of attitude. Terrible service. Horrible food. I live less than a quarter mile from this subway but I am always more than happy to drive 5 mikes out of my way to go to a different one with better service.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just had the best Subway experience I have ever had. The manager seemed to know everyone who came in and for some reason people asked him about his magic. Which when I got to the register prompted me to ask as well. I'm so glad I did. I love Subway, but I also love magic. Lemme just say this was an amazing visit, and I will be back soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat friendly service! This place set the bar high for the other subways in town and the manager (Jason) is so friendly. We need more like this!\n\n\n\n\n\nJason is the best! Been to subway a million times! Different locations..Jason's sandwich is always the best! He's always so friendly..helps with suggestions when I can't make up my mind and always jus makes a bomb ass sandwich! Can't say enough good things about this guy..except I hope you're paying him well! Thank you Jason!\n\n\n\n\n\nI frequent this location often now that the business is run by someone who is doing a lot to win back customers. The food is fresh, and team members are very friendly. I enjoy going here to order my platters for board meetings and my kids like the meatball subs. :) I'm glad I don't have to drive to a different location when I want Subway. Very satisfied!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMinus stars if possible. I ordered 6\" veggie delite, no cheese. They're on special this month. I've been to Mesa, Scottsdale, Phoenix and all of them have them for $2 this month. That's what I normally eat anyhow. \nI got charged full price,  the guy behind me had a footlong loaded with meat & cheese and his was less than mine. I questioned the owner he said \"we don't have to follow the other Subways,  we have a meat sub special.\" I then remembered I was in the same place months ago and ordered the daily special for Friday,  he charged full price then too! He had same response then as well. \nSave your money,  they are rude,  they don't represent Subway in a good light. According to him they don't have to.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am doing a favor to this place by giving them one star. Horrible service! You feel rushed the whole time. All the workers have an attitude problem. THEY DONT CARRY SPINACH, PEPPERJACK CHEESE OR AVOCADO! WTF!? And the jerks would not even put my bacon in the toaster to make it crispy yet it's ok to put my bacon in there if my whole sandwich is being toasted?? Screw this place... Avoid it at ALL costs.\n\nThey are marked expensive because their food sucks ass for one and their service puts the icing on the cake. They should pay me to walk in.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our normal go to Subway and we usually have great service, I believe the gentlemen's name is Jason. \n\nToday we arrived at about 3:15 to a no name sandwich artist...no name tag. When we walked in the place was empty but we were informed that the Internet was down and we had to pay cash. No problem. We walked over to Albertsons bought a few items and got cash back. Subway here we come. \n\nThis time 3 people were in front of us. The first sandwich took forever..like 10 minutes. And it was just meat cheese and black olives. The next person in line made small talk before ordering as did the 3rd person. Both were busy on their phones so either they did not hear or our sandwich artist failed to inform them of the cash only option. The 1st person actually had the nerve to ask if he had cash and she would pay him back at a later date. Might explain the small talk. Neither person in front of me took their sandwiches because neither had cash.\n\nOur sandwich was made fairly quickly and he was pleasant enough. Store wasn't clean, clean but passed inspection. \n\nNot sure if this will be our Subway anymore. I just can't see standing in line for 30 minutes for 3 slices of meat and a slice of cheese, not when there is another on a few blocks down.\n\n\n\n\n\nI highly recommend never coming here I've been here many times before even before the new owner took over and while I will admit the previous owners were extremely rude to their customers at least I've never had a mistake on my sandwiches for them but with this new owner I understand she's new to all of this from what I'm hearing but she looks extremely unexperienced in what she's doing to the point that I've seen mistakes made so many times my number one issue is overhearing her telling employees not to properly wash there hands because it waste time that he could be using to do something else I don't even want to think of how many times I've had someone here making sandwich since she started here and not have their hands wash because she told them not to I also don't find it very professional when she's she is making my sandwich while another person who just started there that day was making the person next to me sandwich throughout it she kept pointing out mistakes the new employee made but the owner herself with making more mistakes than the employee she sliced my bread so thin that there was a hole in it but refuse to switch it out for new one even though I said something about it she didn't pay attention and kept referencing of some sort of post it note taped to the board where she kept looking at to figure out what she was making when I told her that's not what I wanted on it she did not ask to remake it she just apologized and I decided I'm not spending any more time here the worst part is the new employees finish sandwich look much better than the one that the owner had made for me\n\nI recommend going to the other closer location in the Safeway parking lot they know how to make a sandwich and fix any mistakes\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to go to this Subway and have Jason make your sandwich.  He has the cucumbers and tomatoes all lined up for visual effect and so they don't dry out. He takes such pride in building your sandwich. He even caressed the bag gently after he put in my sandwich.  It was such a work of art that I gently cradled my sandwich to the car. Not to mention how nice Jason is.  Best Subway experience ever!\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately this is the closest subway to my house and it never fails to disappoint.  I first ate here about 2 years ago and the experience was terrible.  First off they don't honor the daily deal with the 6 inch sub with drink and chips, fine I ordered a footlong Italian BMT which was a struggle since I could barely understand the employee.  The lettuce was brown and the bread tasted old.  Fast forward two years, as I gave the place a second chance.  Still no meal deal even though every other subway has one.  This time I ordered a tuna footlong.  The guy scraped the last inch of tuna from the bottom of the tray which clearly was left from last night since I got it in the morning to have as my lunch. I asked him if I could get fresh tuna and he refused - seriously.  Lettuce once again brown and wilted.  Tasted terrible as expected, I'm done going here I would rather drive another 10 mins to eat fresh\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, I LOVE Subway. I eat there almost daily, and sometimes twice daily. This is the absolute worst Subway I have ever eaten, and this being said after trying to give this place a chance because I am close to it often. No matter.... I will drive somewhere else. The stores appearance is ok but the help is choking the business. There are a few foreign girls working there that almost ignore you and anyone else that walks in the door. As you patiently stand there waiting, they will eventually ask you what you want (appearing like you are bothering them) and then pile all of your ingredients in a huge pile in the center of your sandwich, and debate you when you try to get them to put stuff at the ends, and not completely smother one side with mayo and try to move their hand to the side attempting to cover rest of sandwich yet only leaving a dribble past the first mountainous pile. They talk about you in their other language like your not even standing there. The absolute RUDEST staff possible. Does the owner even know what is going on there? Or do they even care?\n\nDrive 10 miles to another one, or find a Jersey Mikes somewhere....\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree with Andrew T.  When my wife and I walked in, right away we felt like we were disturbing the two female employees' social hour.  There was No, \"Hi, welcome to Subway\", better yet, no response and/or acknowledgement at all.  Last time I checked, customers at any business makes the paycheck.  Also, when we finally got service, we were quickly rushed, and ofcourse no \"Thank you\".  I only gave one star to the fact that nothing was wrong with our food, but really how can you mess that up when the customers are telling them what we want on our subs.", "useful": 0.7647058823529411, "cool": 0.11764705882352941, "funny": 0.29411764705882354, "date": "2012-02-23 07:17:38"}, "12": {"business_id": "-3oxnPPPU3YoxO9M1I2idg", "business_name": "Eklectic Pie - Mesa", "address": "1859 S Stapley Dr, Ste 105-3", "attributes": "{'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': \"u'average'\", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Alcohol': \"'beer_and_wine'\", 'RestaurantsAttire': \"'casual'\", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\", 'WiFi': \"'free'\", 'GoodForMeal': \"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}\", 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'Ambience': \"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}\", 'HasTV': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True'}", "categories": "None", "city": "Mesa", "hours": "{'Monday': '11:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}", "postal_code": "85204", "review_count": 126, "stars": 4.0, "state": "AZ", "review": "Great place, good quality toppings. But if you load up the toppings they will serve the pizza slightly under cooked. Pro tip: ask for extra cook on loaded pies\n\n\n\n\n\nCheese and pepperoni ok. Sauce was excellent, cheese ok not good or horrible. Crust ok. Had 2 wall of fame pizza. Potato and flame thrower both horrible. \"Homemade\" cola products out of fountain really good. \n\nSauce -excellent \nCheese- so/so\nCrust- ok\n\nNot crazy expensive, ok value\n\n\n\n\n\nNicely decorated place. I had the chairman chow pizza and it was pretty tastey. My wife had the meat lovers? Pizza.....meh? Ok at best.\nThe black cherry cola was good.\n2 pizzas 2 sodas.....22.00\nPlease do mistake this for good pizza from your local pizzeria. View it as something else because it does not compare. Interesting dining concept but the end product does not impress. If they only used a dough that is thicker and bubbles up.....maybe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workers at Pie Five Pizza Company are so great. I was wondering why the place was empty, but when we got our food I began to understand. The pizza crust is pretty bad and I got balsamic dressing for my salad which is usually oil based, but this balsamic was like syrup. Even with great service I would not go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo numerous of these types of pizza places are popping up all over the valley.\nThis will be the 2nd one I've been too.\nIt's good, it's fun. I'm not blown away by any means. We had a party of 7 come in and ordered 7 different pizza's and sampling one another.  My 11 year old son ate two 7 inch pizzas! \nI'll be back, my kids like it better than the other we've been too. I know these guys have been here awhile, and it sucks for them to see another EXACT replica pizza place going up `100 feet away and a MAJOR chain going in across the parking lot. \nTHUMBS UP EKLECTIC PIE!!\n\nWe also ordered 2 dessert pizzas that were the bomb!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm happy to give this place five stars.  It's not fancy, but it is fresh, fast, great employees and consistently so.  We've eaten there 3 times, and really look forward to it.  I'm always looking for healthy choices, and I'm really happy to find this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was awesome! The husband and I checked it out after some shopping in the complex. We got the Italian pizza and it was delicious! Loved the sauce and the extra helping of toppings. The crust is really thin and crispy, very good as well. The service staff was very nice and cleaned up our plates when we were done. Also before we left they handed out frisbee's and water bottles that had their logo on it. We will be back for sure! And we are just down the road so very close too!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove EP! Everything is fresh and made to order. Besto Pesto is my favorite! Servers are friendly and location is clean. The decor is eclectic and comfy seating. Highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nEklectic Pie\nThe staff are friendly, the atmosphere is fun and the food is good.\nWe came in before they officially opened and enjoyed two free pies.\nYou get to choose your own size, 7\" or 11\" and then choose your own toppings.  You can add as many toppings as you want, in any combination to make your pie.  The toppings are fresh, varied and delicious!  Since I got exactly what I wanted, i really enjoyed my pie.\nThe food came out fast and the staff were attentive.  Since this is close y my house, and a local movie theater, I will be back; and bring friends!\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh ingredients, great tasting pizza, beer and soda with real cane sugar.  You can also get salads. and the price is great.  No extra cost for toppings!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI came back again. The pizza is so thin and burned... sad face. I did tell him And he was very accommodating. We appreciate it and still love this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nTried out a new place.  Kids are picky and they loved it.  We tried different pizzas and the pizza nubs.  Good, nothing brand new to the industry but very good pizza and we will be back.  A great step up from your hole in the wall pizza joint.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place but the STAPLEY location is closed. Visit their Chandler location.\n\nQuick delicious pizza your way.  This is my second review. I highly recommend this pizza restaurant.\n\nWine Country Pizza\nAlfredo Sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola, caramelized onion & walnuts topped with baby spinach leaves & balsamic fig vinaigrette.\n\nThe cowboy barbeque pizza was delicious. The employees are friendly.\n\nThe atmosphere is pleasant. I highly recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I came here a couple weeks ago. We were so impressed by the quality of the customer service, the types of food that was offered and how delicious it all was.  I was amazed to see they even offer dairy free cheese, the daiya brand  (I have a child with a dairy intolerance). When I asked about the cheese, the girl that made my pizza who suffers from Gluten and dairy intolerance made an entire pizza just for my little boy so that I could take it home for him to try. She went above and beyond in making us feel welcome. We also loved the monday night prices-you get a whole pizza for only $5, it might actually be all day I can't remember. Either way, we will definitely be back. Thanks Eklectic Pie!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was impressed.  I usually only go to fired pie of mod Pizza, but this place is just as, if not better than those places. If your a soda drinker they use all natural sugar rather than the high fructose corn srp which taste better than regular soda\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered three of their pies and good flavor and good crust.  Wish they would let us order over the phone as we tried but they pointed us to creating an on-line account so ended up going in.  Staff was friendly and prices were reasonable...will be back and looking forward to trying out their beverages...both adult and sodas/China Mist teas!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually the pizza is really good and the service is amazing, bought 4 pizzas, one was supposed to have a finisher on it, got home and looked at my pizza and realized it wasn't on it. My wife and daughter had a pizza each with the chopped chicken and they both got sick.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow I miss this place. :( \n\nThey were awesome and you could build your own pizza like at mod. They were great about seperation. \n\nIt seemed they closed the Stapley location and I have not yet had the chance to go to Chandler.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuuuuper slow. The line was not that long, maybe 4-5 customers ahead of us but we waited in line for almost 30 minutes to order and pay for our food, then another 15 to get our food. The workers looked like they were moving in slow motion. Like, painfully slow. If you've got a movie you're trying to make, plan for at least 45-60 minutes!\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza was great. Fast service. Restaurant was clean and staff were friendly. Like the prices too! I will definitly go back. Welcome to the area Eclectic Pie!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a HUGE fan of Mod pizza.  Unfortunately I have to drive about 15 minutes away to get to it.  This however, is just down the street.\n\nIf you're a man...then you get lots of meat.  That's exactly what I said...give me all the meat.  For any of the meat that I love...extra!  The staff was very accommodating and didn't even blink an eye to what I was requesting.  I loved the different ingredients which seem to blow all the other \"custom pizza\" places out of the water (this is our 4th or 5th pizza restaurant).\n\nIt is very comparable to MOD including some of the sauces.  I wish, however, that they offered ranch as a side in the end.  If they do (since they offer salads) they didn't make it clear.  \n\nI love the interior of the place.  It's very modern but homey as well.  The atmosphere really did feel like a \"family\" atmosphere.  Families were eating together and the owners (who seemed to be anyways) would mingle and laugh along with everyone.\n\nThe dough is okay.  It is a little bit crispier since they don't \"oven bake\" it but rather use one of those pizza conveyer ovens.  MOD pizza would use a fake wood/brick fire stove or whatever but the crust is always soggy since it's never left there in time.\n\nI also appreciated that I don't have to walk to the counter to grab my pizza rather I can just take in the atmosphere and have it brought to the table!\n\nPrice:  Very reasonable!\n\nThings to improve:  The staff are a little slow.  There was a couple behind us who was pointing at one of the ladies placing the sauce on top of the pizza.  If I didn't know any better it would be like my 3 year old trying to place the sauce.  She placed it on a tablespoon at a time with the giant ladle.  It's not that she placed too little...she placed a lot...it just took FOREVER.  That's the theme of this whole experience.  Yes they were friendly, filled with energy...MAYBE they are just getting into the groove of things since it is now a 3 week old restaurant but sheesh get some speed in since there's a line!\n\nBottom line:  We'll return again!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tried Eklectic pie for the first time this weekend. We were VERY impressed. Delicious pizza's with all the extra toppings you could want. Get the roasted garlic, it's heavenly!!! I got the Potato Skin pizza... OMG it was amazing!!! Hubby and little one both got something different and it was perfect for each of us. We all can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have a gluten free crust for the pizza and it's the best crust I've ever had!!! Usually it all tastes like cardboard and I love that you can put whatever you want on them for no extra charge! Definitely coming here from now on anytime I crave pizza!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery good pizza.  Looking forward to ordering from here again and trying some different pies.  Great prices too.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, wasn't expecting such a variety of toppings and sauces that were fresh amd delicious; the sauces were impressive and mighty tasty I had a mix of basil pesto and cilantro jalapeno lime. Woth fresh mozzarella, graded mozzarella, sun dried tomatos, red onions, fesh basil, red peppers, mushrooms and roasted garlic. An amazing pie with fresh ingredients delivered from an amazingly friendly staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy fiance and I came across a project pie in Vegas and fell in love with the concept, so when we saw this opened up right down the street from the house we were all over it.\n\nThe owner was holding the door to greet customers which was very nice customer service he explained the concept him and his wife decided to implement into the restaurant and thanked us for coming. All the employees were very nice and the inside was decorated perfectly. Since it is new there was a lot of people and limited seating (understanable). I am a plain pizza person so I only get pepperoni and my fiance gets meat lovers, he enjoyed his pizza although for myself it came out soggy and floppy. I also noticed there was no corn mean on the dough.... To me that's what makes a pizza, also they use ovens like dominos or pizza hut would use instead of a fire oven or brick oven which changes the taste completely. It was good but I would drive further to another place with the same concept next time. \n\nIt's a shame becuase I wanted to really like this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic service from the top down!  Tyler Leija runs his restaurant like a well-oiled machine and his knowledge of his products and craft beers are impressive!!  \n\nTatyana Leija and Hayley Stout are unbelievable behind the counter.  They explained the process of how things work (we were \"virgin eklectics) and the ingredients used and even allowed a sample of stuff to my wife before having to order. This is what a restaurant should be like everywhere. Great People, Outstanding Customer Service and Delicious Food!!  KUDOS!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBest pizza in town. Build your own and don't brake the bank. To top it all off they have dark beer . Heaven!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I hate the spelling, love this place! First visit, and I'm hooked and can't wait to take the kids. I got the 7\" chicken pesto pie and added garlic, basil and ranch. I was planning on skipping the crust (carbs) but it was super thin and crisp! I didn't even eat it all and spent less than $6! Yes! I'll be back\n\n\n\n\n\nObsessed with this place! Everything I've had has been amazing! Anything with the Spicy Cilantro Lime sauce is the bomb! Sgt. Peppers is my favorite. They have local craft beer and all natural sodas!\n\n\n\n\n\nI kept seeing this place when I would drive by and always wanted to try it. I would hear how yummy it was so I decided to get it delivered through grub hub. It was very fast and everything was exactly how I ordered it. I got the loaded potato skin pizza, and sgt. peppers pizza. The crust was thin which I liked, and everything was fresh and amazing. I also ordered a side salad with a bunch of toppings, and they didn't miss one topping. I would definitely recommend this place. Good job guys! Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\nYUMMMM is the best way to describe this place. Buikd it yourself or get it straight of their menu. Either way, you cant lose.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family and I have absolutely loved this place since it opened a few months ago. Their staff is always unbelievably friendly, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere is really nice. We've tried a handful of \"build your own\" pizza places and this one by far surpasses its competition. Their local cane sugar sodas are also a really nice surprise. We also appreciate the occasional coupons in the mail, and at least once a month they have a great value special. We will be returning and recommending often.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a bad place for pizza but not the best either.\nIf you're out walking (like my husband and i were 4.5miles at that point) and you don't want heavy food then a small pizza and a small salad does the job.\n\nI had the Italian white wedding which was good, although they could have cooked it a little longer and my Husband had the gyro, which he thought was good.\n\nProbably not a place I'd go again but its not bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not a pizza person. I went here to get my son something to eat and decided to get my own pizza since I saw they had vegan options. I have to say I was super impressed! I ate the entire 8\" pizza and I never eat that much pizza. The sauce was great and not overly salty or oily (I hate that) and had tons of flavor. I love veggie toppings and they had a ton of veggies in addition to vegan cheese which was great. I also loved that you can get addtional toppings like spinch, basil, vinaigrette, etc when the pizza comes out of the oven. \n\nAnother thing I really appreciated was the employee switched out his gloves before making my pizza so as not to contaminate mine with the cheese/meat from the previous pizza. The staff is super nice and the atmosphere is really cute. I also appreciate the Arizona wines that they carry. So happy to come across this little gem!\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know how to put this exactly but I'll give it a try.   This place is perfect.  I got exactly what i wanted within a decent amount of time.  The desert pie was unexpectedly wonderful.  Super creative and I love the local ingredients.  Thank you owner of this wonderful mouth play-land.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood pizza made quickly, without skimping on quality.  You can have a mountain of toppings, all for the same price.  Great selection of Boylan sodas!  Fast service!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was given a recommendation from a co-worker about this place, so I decided to take my family with me for the experience.  I knew that it had recently opened up, but I was not aware that it was their second weekend.  They ran like a well oiled machine.  Everyone was pleasant, engaging with customers, happy, and hard working individuals.  The set up is much like Blaze Pizza in CA.  You choose your crust size - gluten free is available - (7-inch $5.49  or 11-inch $7.99), sauce, cheese(s) meats, veggies, and fresh toppings.  They have some combo pizzas choices you can choose from, or you can make your own.  You can have as many toppings on your pizza as you like - no extra charge.  They also have subs (3 choices and they all are $7.49), salads ($7.29), and dessert pies ($2.99).  Their drinks are All natural pure cane sugar soft drinks, Boylan's, and China Mist Iced Teas.  They also have a limited selection of wines and beers.  We made it through the line quickly, and were provided our meals in probably less than 15 minutes.  They were made to perfection!  There were individuals cleaning up tables, serving food, and asking patrons how their meal was.  The bathrooms were clean, tidy, and had a pleasant smell to them.  I am definitely bring more friends, family, and co-workers to this joint.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter waiting in line we left. The gal putting together the pizzas, pulled some raw chicken wings out of the fridge and put them on a tray to be baked. She then went straight to the toppings wearing the same gloves covered in raw chicken. Didn't want to get sick, so we left.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, first time there and last time!!\nOrdered an 11 inch pizza while is an adult personal pizza, the 7 inch is for kids!\nMy pizza was tasteful but not enough for the price, cracker crust assembly pizza which they cant cut pizza correcly so trying to take it apart was a mess.\nYou would have to order 3 pizzas just to get full, not worth the price, its a pizza subway!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I came here for the first time and loved it! Pizza was awesome and so was the staff! We'll definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nEh. The girl that made my pizza was nice enough. But when I asked for a to go piZza and sat down they put it on a metal pizza plate and brought it to my table..... okay so this tells me you couldn't be bothered to listen to me. \nMy brother walked up to the table and asked for a to go box and explained the issue. \nThey gave him a box too small for the pizza to go in. \nHe goes back AGAIN and RE-EXPLAINS what he wants and they finally give him the right box. Disappointed. Wish the staff had bothered to listen. \n The pizza at least was amazing and hit but they didn't rly have any regular coke or Pepsi products. They opted for strange unheard of cans of beer and \"hip\" drinks like izze. Their soda machine featured strange flavors like cream and ginger. They were good but I wish I didn't feel like I had to try something completely new. \n\nPoor service , strange drink choices, good pizza. Two stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot impressed at all! Pizzas are tiny and the salad even tinier. Prices are way to high for the small amount of food received. Won't be returning here!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent pizza and good service. The soda they have is amazing! I like the Creme soda, personally. Definitely a place I'll be coming to often.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love coming here for lunch! Everyone is super friendly and the pizza is delicious!  We look forward to the fresh ingredients and consistent great pizza every time!\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered online and got confirmation that it would be ready at 5:50pm. I showed up at 5:50pm and went to the carry out counter. The staff didn't acknowledge me. 10 minutes pass and I still haven't been acknowledged. The line was getting long and people were becoming impatient. At 6:15 (25 minutes after I arrived) a man behind me in line spoke up and said that he had been waiting awhile. They quickly gave him his to-go pizzas. What?! I STILL had not been acknowledged at this point and I'm going on 30 minutes waiting in the store. I had ordered online an HOUR prior. So now I'm upset and considering just leaving but I had prepaid for my pizzas. A second man in line behind me received his carry out order and left.  A staff member finally asked what the name on my order was and I told them. They couldn't find it. After looking for a few minutes, my order was found in the warming oven. So...I paid full price for cold, cardboard-like pizza after waiting nearly 40 minutes. Come on! Totally unacceptable. The staff member just said, \"Sorry, we don't have a good system\". Once I got home, I had further realized that they did not even include the right sauce on my pizza. I'm baffled right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place!  Service was awesome, fresh ingredients, all organic.  Family environment!\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing pizza, great fresh ingredients.  No heat lamps or microwaves!  Cane sodas and top notch customer service.  We WILL be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat prices, great staff and amazing tasting pizza. I love this place, it's the only place I go to for pizza these days.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't care for their food. I like the idea behind it, but it's flawed.  The toppings are the best part of their menu.  The crust itself is flimsy and tasteless. I didn't care for the sauce either. They are slow\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tried Eklectic Pie for the first time today. It's a fairly new place & I really didn't realize it was a Pizza Place until I received a coupon in the mail. Finally went in, the place was much larger than I expected, nice atmosphere, friendly & helpful employees and best of all, food was great. Price was reasonable too, We will definitely go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered online--menu stated a meatball sandwich came with a Caesers salad--uh no!\nWhen I picked it up, I asked the employee about it and she said \"oh, I think they changed\nthat\", I said no they have not changed it in the computer to which her response was \"oh\".\nNot that impressed with the pizza.  I ordered 4 toppings and they were barely there, a lot of\nempty space between toppings. The pizza did not look anything like the photos provided on yelp.    Since I ordered online and it was my first order, I received\na free dessert and I chose s'mores pie--I'm just glad I didn't pay for it because it tastes \nterrible.  Needless to say, I won't be returning--on to the next.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have order threw them online for our work lunch and I love that you can order WHATEVER YOU WANT! and the price does not change. Amazing place food is great.\n\n\n\n\n\nI did like it, but it's now closed.\n\nThere are other locations that you can go to though. You pick the pie, the sauces, the ingredients - everything is individual and included in the price. It's quick, and I usually come away with a bit left over.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I ate here for the first time and we were thoroughly impressed. We walked in and noticed what a cool environment there was right away. Then we were immediately met at the front by (I believe) the manager and he welcomed us. Then he caught us by surprise when he went through the menu and how ordering went in very good detail. We were blown away at the awesome customer service and him treating us like we were the only customers in the entire world. We went through and ordered our pizzas and the staff making the pies were also very friendly and made sure several times they had our orders right. There wasn't a long wait for the pizzas to be baked and then they were hand delivered to our table. The food was absolutely delicious and the prices were great too. My wife and I will be coming back time and time again and will recommend this place to everyone we know\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has a nice interior and friendly staff. The prices are good and the ingredients fresh. They do not have big brand soda either. Instead it serves Boylan's pure sugar cane soft drinks. I had the lunch special of a 7\" pie and a side ceasar salad. The pie was excellent but could possibly need a little longer in the oven and the salad was great except for a few large lettuce pieces ( I try not to look like a crazy person stuffing in a huge bite when possible lol). But those were such small things that I can give it 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest pizza I've had in awhile. Make your own. Tons of toppings and no extra charge no matter what you put on your pizza.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place. It is a refreshing/new way to order pizza. I have eaten there several times now and every time its been a thumbs up. Its priced perfectly. I would recommend this unique spot to anyone!!\n\n\n\n\n\nTried this place for the first time.  The service is is GREAT!  You can tell that the employees really like working here.  So friendly and helpful.  As compared to other like pizza joints (e.g. think Subway of pizza) this one is definitely the best.  Fresh ingredients, great price, crust is good--a little thin for my taste but next time I will get the double crust for just a buck more. Oh, and the beer and wine choice... awesome.  They have local craft beers in cans and on tap for a little over $4 ($3 during HH) and top rated local wines for a little over $5 (also $3 for HH).  Just go, you can't go wrong here.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have eaten here twice now the first time I got the wine country which is a delicious pear spinach gorgonzola pizza. This time I decided on the Sgt. Peppers which i expect to be just as delicious I got the Tutti pie Fruitti it is so good i finished the whole thing with my bf i can not ussually eat that much but it was to good to pass up. They have delicious unique soda we got the root beer which k think has just a hint of vanilla but was oh so good. They also have birch beer soda yummy town U.S.A.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went in and ordered a gluten-free pepperoni pizza. It was nice that the person making the pizza change their gloves to make sure there was no gluten on it and made the gluten-free pizza for me.  It was cooked to perfection and ready to eat in about three minutes.   Restaurant was very clean and the food was a good value for the money.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was a first timer and they deserve more than 5 stars! Excellent customer service!!!! Good environment, clean, unique soda selections and delicious pizza!! Definitely recommend them and will be back more!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent opening day!  Very fast and friendly service.  The pizzas were great!  The crust was really good, which is important.  \n\nI built my own meatlovers style pizza with an alfredo sauce base, real mozzarella, shredded mozzarella, house recipe meatballs, spicy italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, grilled chicken, black olives and mushrooms. It came out PERFECT.  The meats had great flavor and the fresh mozzarella was really nice.\n\nMy girlfriend made a pizza with a pesto base sauce, which she said was really good.  She also had a few different meats and lots of veggies.  She said hers was great as well.  We're both looking forward to leftovers!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place! It's like the subway of pizzas as you pay one price and can heap toppings to your hearts delight and all for only nine bucks! I'm not sure how these guys stay in business so just out of guilt I always end up buying drinks or a side (the wings and skins are fantastic!). They offer craft sodas and an eclectic beer menu that changes from week to week. Tip: Get on their mailing list and use their rewards program and you will get all kinds of deals sent your way. Bon Appetit!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here about a dozen times since they opened. I'll start with the good - the food is undeniably fantastic. It tastes great, hot, and fresh. The price is right and the beer is cold. Dont even get me started on the s'mores pie - it's the best!\n\nHowever, the speed of service is absolutely abysmal and seems to be getting worse with each passing week. This last trip on Saturday 8/13 around 6pm was the last straw. The place was not busy - there were about 5 people in line ahead of us. We waited in that line for 20-25 minutes. UNREAL wait time. The music system was also off (inexplicably) so we waited in silence, painfully aware of the impatient sighs and chatter of all the guests now waiting in the slow building line behind us. \n\nThe staff has absolutely no hustle. They need to be re-trained to ensure speedy service to guests. The bottleneck at the counter is terrible. Not sure if they need more ovens, more employees, or an espresso machine to get their staff moving, but something has to give. \n\n3/5 stars until this is addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ate here tonight after looking at the reviews. We didn't know what we were really getting into. WOW! The service from everyone here was great. Every employee was helpful and just good people. The product was amazing, we had three pies. 4 beers and a coke for $34. THAT IS AMAZING! You have to come here. Monday pizza nights are now scheduled at Eclectic!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I were here recently and really enjoyed it! The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was great! The pizza was delicious  and my husband commented that he especially liked the pizza sauce. I tried the Orange Blossom wheat beer and my husband tried the birch beer (which is non-alcoholic and similar to root beer), and we both loved our choices! We will definitely be visiting this place again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my second review. I highly recommend this pizza restaurant.\n\nWine Country Pizza\nAlfredo Sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola, caramelized onion & walnuts topped with baby spinach leaves & balsamic fig vinaigrette.\n\nThe cowboy barbeque pizza was delicious. The employees are friendly.\n\nThe atmosphere is pleasant. I highly recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest pizza joint around!!!! Sorry, no joke, the rest of the pizza joints around here should just close up. No one can touch the amazing pies at Eklectic Pie!!!!! Every time my wife and I go there, everyone is happy and smiling. Don't forget to order a soda, because the root beer is by far the best around!!! Take out, eat in, it doesn't matter. Fantastic ingredients, friendly service, the making for a perfect business plan!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is so yummy! The Flame Thrower is my favorite. Such good flavor. Everyone who works here is amazing too. Can't wait until the new store in Gilbert is open. Thanks for such a fun experience spinning the wheel too.\n\n\n\n\n\nFound our new date night place! Love the vintage/modern look. Very friendly staff and great food! Not expensive at all! Try it out you will love it! We got the 11\" Cowboy BBQ & 11\" Flame Thrower. Very good size personal pizzas and very filling! Then we got the cookie smasher *WARNING NO ICE CREAM ON THE COOKIE * BUT!! It was still amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is laid back and different. Pizza was good and the gluten free crust was well done. Overall you walk through a line and pick your toppings, nice thing is all toppings included in the price of the crust size so, load up! Other than that, they do have draft beer on tap plus a few microbrew selections. Price was about normal for what you would consider... family of 5 (mom, dad 3 kids) about $40 (including the pint of IPA I enjoyed... Life is good you know... enjoy it!\n\n\n\n\n\nI really like the feel of this place. I have been twice in the last month. The pizzas cook quickly and the service has been great. They have a great lunch special.  Small pizza and side salad for around seven dollars which is plenty to fill up on. I usually get the pepperoni pizza with Caesar salad. Their Caesar salad dressing is one of the best I have had. I have suggested this place to friends and coworkers without hesitation. Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed. They do have a self serve soda machine but it is not Coca-Cola or Pepsi products. I believe its called Boylan's soda. My friend said its good. I don't drink soda but I think it's cool that they serve something other than the big two soda companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat an amazing place. The employees are fun to talk to. They make great, insightful recommendations. I ordered the pizza and was amazed by the flavor. Great crust, which in my mind makes or breaks a pizza, great flavor. I can't wait to come back to try another.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll five in my party tried a different pizza and we loved them all!! Getting ready to order some dessert which I'm sure will be just as good..\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cowboy barbeque pizza was delicious. The employees are friendly.\n\nThe atmosphere is pleasant. I highly recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood concept Horrible execution. I don't think anybody that has posted about this place has any idea what pizza is supposed to be!!!!!!! They do use nice ingredients and that's about all that's good about the food. You walk up to order your pizza pick your toppings and they put it on a piece of dough that is half dried out. Take a look around while ordering it's like your in a hospital cafeteria there is not even a pizza oven in the place it's put into an oven that has a conveyer belt and pops out the other side just like the easy bake oven my 4 year old has at home. Pizza is about fire and stone. Like I said ingredients were good, crust was not, not at all!! There is no pizza feel to the place at all . I hate to bash a place but this place needs to rethink there approach to pizza . Employees are very nice but very slow.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent pizza. I love that they don't charge for each topping, it's all one price.  That's such a great policy.  The guys making the pizzas were obviously loving their jobs, so I'm guessing they treat their people well.\n\nTaste was great, nice thin crust, everything tested fresh.  Highly recommend trying it.  I wish they had one in east mesa.\n\n\n\n\n\nI called on Weds before Thxgiving to place an order and was told I needed to order online only.  I created a profile and tried to order and I kept getting an \"unavailable \" error online.  I waited 10 minutes again and still received the error.  I called back to inform them of their online issues and he said he would reboot his online server.  I asked if i could just  place a telephone order but was quickly dismissed.  The guy said...\"I'm busy making a pizza and don't have time to take a phone order.\"   Really??? Too busy to sell a pizza???\n\nNot a good first impression here\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere and drink selection is the real winner here. The endless toppings are also a cool way to personalize your pizza pie. The pizza is ok, but depending on your taste, there are better pizzas out there. The staff was friendly and over the top excited to help out. \n\nOverall I would recommend checking this place out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is great! The pizzas are always made fresh! Fresh ingredients and great service! And it's always clean! That's a plus plus, cheap and affordable, made fresh every time. The staff is also very informative on what certain ingredients are and how they taste, and they have local brewery beers on hand that are affordable as well. I try to eat here as much as possible! It's a five star in my book!\n\n\n\n\n\nCool concept! It's like subway but for pizza. It's actually really good. Great if you have a bunch of people who can't decide on pizza toppings. A tad pricey for what you actually get; however, i would definately come back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat pizza for a great price. Good specials M-W. Friendly staff. Quick, easy, tasty, and just the right size for everyone to have their own pizza.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to grab a bite to eat with low expectations since I haven't had the best luck with this style restaurant, but I was surprised by the taste and variety of options! I was guided by Tyler who helped me make a wonderful pizza. Johnathan and Leesha helped answer questions and the entire staff seemed knowledgeable and friendly. It's a really cool spot and I'll definitely be back. The craft soda and fresh teas were a huge surprise too!\n\n\n\n\n\nIF YOU WANT TO ORDER FROM GRUBHUB, BEWARE!!! This location will not start your order until the driver is there, even if he or she calls ahead and let's them know they're on the way. \n\nAdditionally, if the driver is already there for another GrubHub customer, and your order happens to come in while he or she is waiting, they will refuse to give your order to the driver, opting instead to have someone else dispatched to get your food.\n\nThe result for you is a needless delay of 30-60 more minutes in getting your food!\n\nMy suggestion is save yourself the delay in getting your dinner, and order from another pizza place that uses GrubHub. Sal's Gilbert Pizza is an excellent choice!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yes hello, i would like a cheese pizza with everything you have to eat in this building put on the pizza as a topping for no extra charge\"\n\nthat's how this place works. And they have brews....see ya\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place. An entree salad is $8 and comes with whatever you want: Italian sausage, pepperoni, sliced mozzarella, blue cheese crumbles, parmesan, cheddar, carmelized onions, mushrooms, red peppers, chopped tomatoes, raw red onions, black & green olives, artichokes and more!\n\nYou can have any of that on a pizza; or choose one of their unique specialties.  Garlic parmesan knots with a side of marinara is $3. Good. $2 domestics during weekday lunch.\n\nRelaxed atmosphere.\n\nThey serve Boylan's brand sodas, and some iced teas. On the plus side, they have birch beer (kind of like root beer).\n\n\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love pizza? But, having a family of four used to leave someone out. Now, we can each get our own pizzas with whatever we want and it's super affordable. My husband and I really enjoy good beer and they have the greatest selection. They let us sample each one and I chose the Koffee Kolsch! It's Sooo delicious. \nI pretty much added every vegetable they had to my pizza and the cost was the same. The fresh basil finisher with balsamic fig sauce was tasty. I recommend the wine country (mine) and the Besto pesto (his). The kids tore up the loaded potato. We will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nYUM! Stopped in for my first time because I had a coupon in the mail for an 11\" pizza ($6.99) which fully fed 2 people. The atmosphere was super laid back and funky urban which gave off a great vibe, the staff was excellent and on their game, super welcoming and helpful. The whole place was very clean and not busy at all for a Saturday night. My pizza was buffalo sauce, with fresh mozzarella/shredded cheese, with chicken. I purchased ranch with that and a large drink. Total came out to $9.57 or so. I was very impressed, from walking in to leaving I got great service, a comfortable dining experience, and PHENOMENAL pizza. WILL definitely be my new pizza place. It was fun watching the employmees make my pizza, it's almost like a chipotle but with pizza! Also the drinks are hip and cool, very tasty. (Cream soda and ginger ale are the ones I tried) YUM! 6/5 stars!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo complaints here. The service, prices, atmosphere and food are phenomenal. We ordered two create your own pizzas and two desserts (see photos for descriptions). Choice of 7 or 11 inch pizzas with a max price of $7.99. Add any toppings and combinations, which is great if you are a newbie or indecisive. You can even do half and half with very different flavors and toppings. \n\nWe actually just tried Fired Pie a few weeks ago and loved the concept. We like the topping variety better at Eklectic and as a heads up, the desserts are much bigger here and could easily shared. We ordered two and brought home leftovers. The chocolate chip was like a flat, half-cooked cookie and the apple was like a pizza crust with apple topping and crumble. The choco chip had more taste to it but the crumbles on the apple version were yummy. \n\nWe signed up for the loyalty program while there (on your phone via their website) and you are immediately eligible for a free dessert. Just give them the name on the loyalty account. We will definitely be back. Fresh ingredients and great options. We will do without the desserts next time (they were good, not great).\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent pizza and service! My mom and I happened to be in the area one night and came here for dinner. We have been coming back ever since! This is the only pizza I truly love the crust is awesome and the people behind the counter are so happy and helpful. Love it. We will be back of course!\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good little place. \nStandard price for the size of your choice (7\" or 11\") and all the toppings you want at no additional charge. \nThe pizza was good. Nothing spectacular but also nothing to complain about. All pizzas are thin crust. I got the Italian Wedding and my spouse got the Meaty Italiano. \nI will be returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was very good. Service was fast. Good had excellent flavor.\n\nI had gone here the other day to use my Birthday loyalty reward. Couldn't ask for any other place for a free pizza for your birthday.\n\nWill definitely be returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo many choices! I ordered the 7\" Wine Country with Alfredo, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, caramelized red onion, walnuts, baby spin inch, and balsamic fig drizzle. It was served quick, hot, and delicious! I also enjoyed a cup of jasmine green tea. All for under $10.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst let me say i do love all the build your own pizza places - it's a trend but as someone with food allergies, it makes ordering easy. I don't have to say I'll have that but without this and that... I can just ask for what I want. So I've been to a lot around the valley and Eklectic Pie is my favorite - the best choice of topping anywhere. Love the bacon, pulled pork and roasted potatoes. Also great crust. And adult beverages too. The decor is also fun.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely the best make it your own type pizza place I've been to, beats Mod Pizza by a mile!! Ingredients are so fresh and their desserts are delicious!!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time in - tried their gluten-free crust margarita pizza and loved it! I will definitely be back again to try more!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove a real gluten-free option for pizza. baked right in front of ne. They even paid special attention to my 4 year old daughter.  They also had soda that was made with real sugar instead of HFCS. I'm impressed,  going back again. Just wished they delivered.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove love love love love. I appreciate that there's competition in the DIY pie arena. The prefab flavor combinations and idea boards really elevate your pie to the next level. Taste is on point along with quality, I enjoyed everything this eclectic pie had to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were the only two people in the restaurant when we ordered. The girl who made our pizzas got one of them wrong which wasn't realized until it was brought to our table because the wrong item was added after being baked. Rather than complain, we ate our meal. The manager came by a short while later and asked how everything was. We informed him of the error and he did offer to make a new pizza. We declined as half of the wrong one was already eaten. He was apologetic and very friendly. I appreciate his offer to correct the other employees mistake but seriously...she had one job and we were the only two customers!! That's only a 50% success rate! I'd hate to see what happens when they're actually busy. The quality of food itself was good; no complaints there but I just don't see is frequenting this place after our first impression.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome pizza. The 7inch is the perfect size. I got the besto pesto chicken pizza. Very yummy!\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting Mesa today and I happened upon Eklectic because of Yelp! THANK YOU Yelp! Seriously, one of the best pizza experiences I've ever had! The crust was light and airy, the toppings were superb, the pure cane sodas were on point.... And to top it off, the customer service was incredible! The only thing I wish for after this experience??? That they open on in  San Diego where I live! I can't wait for my next trip to Mesa so I can come back!!! Well done Eklectic!\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are so many places popping up just like this, Pieology is among my favorite for their plentiful selection toppings. Ekletic Pie is now among my top favorite, the ambiance is unique and comfortable. The topping selection is good with the exception of it missing garlic. The only thing that lost points is the staff is not very friendly, they seem annoyed to be here. The drink area was a little dirty and the menu once you get in, is a bit chaotic to look at. We stated that it was our first time in and were not sure what to get. No suggestions, no information...just a blank stare from the staff. Love that they have a wide variety if food (potato skins, sandwiches,  dessert) and also love the playing cards given to mark your order number. Drinks are okay, teas pepsi, and other cream sodas, rootbeer. You will not find your typical coke or pepsi selection.  Other than that everything is pretty good taste and price wise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf mod pizza married in-n-out burger and had a son, and a local craft brewery got together with mom-and-pop's corner store and had a daughter, then those two kids hooked up, I think their offspring would look a lot like Eklectic Pie.  \n\nThe concept is fast personal pizza with your choice of a zillion items, or somebody else's choices from the wall of fame.  What makes it awesome is the caliber of connectedness and service.  The beer and soda selection is icing on the cake, all enjoyed with creative and welcoming (and a touch curious) decor and music. \n\nA definite must-visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy their custom pizzas. Very good basil pesto pizza. I added jalapeos and it was perf. Marguerita pizza was a little soggy, too much marinara. I like that they serve wine and craft beers. The inside is cool, lots of interesting places to sit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe employees here are friendly and very out going. The whole place is inviting. The toppings on my margarita pizza were delicious, but the pizza itself was undercooked. Made a very disappointing end to a good first impression.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe enjoy coming here. I love loading my pizza with veggie toppings. Always comes out delicious. You can't beat the price for the kid's meal, which includes a drink with the 7 in cheese pizza. Makes it a great place to eat with the family. \nWe have ordered the cookie pizza before too. Not totally crazy about that. A hit with the kids, but nothing special. \nLove the soda offerings!! Not your usual soda choices. If you're a cream soda fan, you will not be disappointed!!! Absolutely delicious. \nI really appreciate the GF pizza option as I have a family member with Celiac disease. They are very accommodating when you tell them about dietary restrictions. \nService can be a little slow. If it weren't for that, I would give them 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow. The last 13 Reviews were 5 Star. SERIOUSLY? I'm not even going to beat around the bush on this one. The pizza was crap. Limp, wet crust. What else can I say. Maybe the ingredients were fresh, but why would it matter. I'm sure the ingredients are as fresh as all the other BYOP places. But what is pizza? Crust. Sauce. Toppings. All 3 have to work together.\nC and I decided to stop by on our way to his rehearsal. He saw the sign the last time we drove thru Raising Cane's so we decided to give it a shot.\nWe both ordered the 11\" Build your own ($7.99 ea.) C's was basically a meat lovers. He added Marinara, Sausage, Pepperoni, Meatball and Fresh Mozz. Sounds good right? It would have been if the crust wasn't like a wet piece of Lavosh. Soggy, no support for the ingredients. Yuk. Now the taste of the toppings were fine. But the toppings don't make a pizza. \nI put Fresh Roma's, Fresh Mozz, Mushrooms, Onions, Marinara & Meatball on mine. The toppings and the sauce were fine but again, the crust was limp, wet, soggy mess. No Bueno.\nThe staff was really nice and the interior of Eklectic was very nice. I did think it was interesting the soda machine dispensed a \"specialty\" soda and not a more recoginized brand. But hey, to each there own. C had a chocolate milk ($1.79) and I had the China Mist Tea ($2.19). (My favorite brand)\nNice Staff. Nice Facility. Clean Dining Room. Good Toppings. Lousy Crust. 2 Stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pizza is so bomb, I love the thin crust and there sauce.. The Italian and the cowboy bqq are really good .. I go crispy 1&1/2 times thru oven for that bomb crisp. All the pizza flavored are good and you can customize it the way you want . The 7 inch is perfect for on person ...\n\n\n\n\n\nI stopped in a few weeks ago and ordered a half loaded potato skin and a half meaty Italiano minus olives pizza ($7.99), and had a San Tan Oktoberfest ($4.39) to wash it all down.  Right away I was greeted by the employees and I really like the interior.  They did a nice job.  It's funky and interesting.  They have a fantastic selection of local brews and wine to choose from as well, and the pizza combinations on the wall of fame are very creative.  I saw several I want to try.  Of course you can also build your own.\n\nThe potato skin pizza had intrigued me when I looked at their menu online, and living up to its name, it does taste like potato skins which goes GREAT with the beer.  The meaty Italiano half was very good as well, with lots of good quality meats.  I just didn't care for the crust.  It's a nice thickness, but totally bland.  I read the other reviews and the owner's comment about why they use the conveyor ovens.  That makes sense.  I just miss some kind of garlicky or buttery or seasoned flavor in the crust if it's not going to have that brick oven flavor and char.  Thankfully the toppings are all excellent and kind of overcompensate for the crust.  I enjoyed my first visit and my husband really enjoyed the leftovers.  I will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really like the concept & the staff was super nice but they couldn't hear a word I said. I kept having to repeat my toppings. Kind of annoying but whatever. \nI only ordered a salad & was thrilled to be able to put as many toppings on as I liked. \nI didn't however like that the meats were ice cold i.e. Bacon, grilled chicken etc... I understand that most stuff gets cooked after you order it but if your having a salad, cold meats don't really work. The worst part of my visit were the salad dressings, they tasted very low quality & definitely not homemade and only four to choose from. Would have loved some balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette. Really no healthy choices :(\nI ended up taking the salad home & using dressing from another restaurant.  \nI'm anxious to try the pizza next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisited based on a friend's recommendation, E.Pie definitely didn't disappoint! Staff was friendly and efficient...ordered the wine country and pesto chicken pizza. Wine country was the favorite between the two. We will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent pizza and service! My mom and I happened to be in the area one night and came here for dinner. We have been coming back ever since! This is the only pizza I truly love the crust is awesome and the people behind the counter are so happy and helpful. Love it. We will be back of course!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came in from a busy morning of running errands and figured we'd give Eklectic Pie a chance. We order two pizza but played it safe on this visit being the reviews are mixed. The service is nice, inside decor is cute. As far as the pizza goes, the sauce is a bit sweet for my tastes and the crust is very thin. As far as toppings go, they are endless. Our next visit I/we won't be as safe. If you have a family that has mixed taste buds when it comes to pizza this for sure would be good for y'all. Affordable, not bad tasting and fast service. \nIt's not easy to find so my suggestion would be to have more signs leading you to the \"right\" pizza place. After awhile they'll be 3 pizza places in the shopping center. My only other thing would be is, on a slow day or time, the music should be played a little lower being your almost yelling at the service worker.\n\n\n\n\n\nTried this place for the first time, the pizza was really good.  However, the service was not as good. They just seemed really unmotivated and kept having to take pizza back as they forgot to cut the pizza. They could definitely use some customer service training.\n\n\n\n\n\nTasty pizzas with fresh ingredients, friendly service, and craft brews makes this place a trifecta of excellence!\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick delicious pizza your way.  This is my second review. I highly recommend this pizza restaurant.\n\nWine Country Pizza\nAlfredo Sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola, caramelized onion & walnuts topped with baby spinach leaves & balsamic fig vinaigrette.\n\nThe cowboy barbeque pizza was delicious. The employees are friendly.\n\nThe atmosphere is pleasant. I highly recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is awesome! Always quick and fresh! Staff is friendly! Very relaxed atmosphere. The pizza is great besto pesto is really good the cowboy had to much bbq sauce for me..\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely love this place! $9 for an 11inch pizza with unlimited toppings, perfect to split with a pizza dessert on the side. Great atmosphere, good quality toppings, and friendly staff. Went here three times the week we discovered it. They also have a rewards program which is great! Highly recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love everything about this place. The toppings are so fun to pile on, their fountain drinks are great and I love their child tours they have every month.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the photos posted by other reivewers I'm thinking maybe we caught them on their off day. We ordered two pizzas, pepperoni and meaty, both 11\" and were underwhelmed. The toppings were scarce, the pizzas tasted too salty, and there was way too much grease. We used a promo code so paid about $13 for two 11\" pizzas which wasn't bad. If I had to pay $19 for them I'd be more disappointed. However, we will not be ordering from them again, there are better pizza places to chose from.\n\n\n\n\n\nDare I say, the best pizza place I have ever been to? \n\nThe best atmosphere! Everyone is so friendly and happy to make suggestions. Fast service. Delicious food. Its like a Chipolte, but for pizza, and without all the salminola or whatever. \n\nIts just good!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I have been to many build your own pizza places and this one disappointed me. I am a vegetarian so I love places where I can make my own food. I felt like the different sauces were not visible unless you looked at the menu around the corner.  I asked the girl that was going to put toppings on the pizza to change her gloves and I thought her jaw hit the floor. She just finished stocking pepperoni and I don't want that in my food. (This is not the first time I have asked this at a pizza place and most people don't care) The pizza is super thin. I like thin pizza a lot but this one is so thin it bends and toppings fall off when you try and pick up a slice. The sauce is super sweet. Wish it was better.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place. Great pizza for an awesome price and they always have top notch service. Looking forward to grabbing a pie in about 10 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wine country\" and \" besto pesto\" gluten free pizza plus a bunch of extra meat veggies and cheeses! They were fast and accommodating! It was clean and very trendy decor! So fast!!!!! \nThe instructional menu was so easy to read and comprehend. Very user friendly. \nClean tables with variety of types like booths, high too vs low top tables! \nCheck out the bathroom signs!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best pizza in town! You get to design your own or choose from favorites - mine is the Sgt. Pepper. The real sugar rootbeer or birch beer is Ah-mazing! And while you're there,  try the dessert pizzas. Oh, and super affordable!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I had heard about Eklectic Pie via Facebook because pizza. And even though we live in downtown Phoenix, we decided to endure the insane 20 min. drive to see what the fuss was all about. We got there an hour before closing time on a Thursday. Things were pretty quiet, which meant no line and faster pizza into my mouth. Everything about this place is really slick. The logo outside is a super bright yellow and eye-catching in the evening. Inside, things are cool, industrial, and unusual. It felt thought-out and meticulous. Once in line, you get the option of 1. choosing your pizza size (7\" or 11\"), 2. picking your sauce and 3. mixing up a variety of awesome ingredients at no extra charge. Shut the front door! No extra charge! A part of me wanted to go nuts, but the other part of me was lazy and really hungry, so we chose to go with 2 different pre-made pies from the \"wall of fame\". The \"Meaty Italiano\" and \"Besto Pesto Chicken\". No dessert this go around, but next time for sure. I don't drink soda, but my boyfriend commented on how the soda was really good and not a corporate brand like Coke or Pepsi, but instead a brand I had never heard of called \"Boylan\". He was a fan.  Anyway, we waited for what felt like about 8 minutes and BAM. Pizza was all up in my grill. Being the meat-lover that I am, I definitely favored the Meaty Italiano. The Besto Pesto Chicken was great too - I think in the future I'd ask for more pesto sauce though. I would've loved to try one of the spicy options, but my boyfriend is a white kid from Vermont. So clearly that'll have to be a solo visit next go-around. All around, the staff was super friendly and made the ordering process very clear and easy. Prices are affordable, pizzas were crisp and fresh. If you live in Mesa or want to hang out with the new pizza kid on the block, go check out Eklectic Pie!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove their pizzas  My favorite has to be the cowboy bbq pizza!! Such a great atmosphere!! Beer and Pizza thumbs up\n\n\n\n\n\nThese guys have the best pizza in town!  You can add as many toppings as you want, all for the same price! 7 inch $5.49-  11 inch $7.99. They try to use all fresh and organic ingredient and hormone free meats, when available. They also have both gluten-free crust and dairy free options,\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious as ever and my daughters new favorite pizza, the Maya Meat Trio.  Acropolis was also delicious and birch beer on fountain is fantastic.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food! Chipotle style ordering. They even have vegan options such as dairy free cheese. They also have a gluten free crust. The atmosphere is fun.", "useful": 0.8931297709923665, "cool": 0.48091603053435117, "funny": 0.2748091603053435, "date": "2015-12-20 14:56:02"}, "13": {"business_id": "-45kMvS7h38CGaWugPY0rg", "business_name": "Roland's Cafe Market Bar", "address": "1505 E Van Buren", "attributes": "{'RestaurantsAttire': \"'casual'\", 'WiFi': \"u'free'\", 'Alcohol': \"u'full_bar'\", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': \"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': False}\", 'HasTV': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'Ambience': \"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}\", 'Caters': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'False'}", "categories": "None", "city": "Phoenix", "hours": "{'Monday': '8:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '8:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '8:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '8:0-22:0', 'Friday': '8:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '8:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '8:0-21:0'}", "postal_code": "85006", "review_count": 90, "stars": 4.0, "state": "AZ", "review": "The best thing I had was the water and dragoon IPA on tap. I ordered the empenada dish because the bartender recommended it and I was very disappointed. It's a 13 dollar dish with 3 small empenadas. The empenadas were okay, not great. It felt more like an over priced stale appetizer. I was still hungry after the emenadas that I had to give another dish a shot and that dish was the Chile Colorado burrito. The burrito was again, okay. For how it tasted and how it looked, 8.00 is about right. I won't be coming back here for a while until the food gets better. \nAs far as an overall restaurant environment, I liked it. But the food, I didn't like so much.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you like overpaying and leaving hungry?  If so, let me introduce you to Roland's!  $11 for three tiny tacos, each with one or two slices of onion or leaves of cilantro, a few pieces of meat, and nothing else going on.  Simple is great, but the few ingredients better pack a punch and these fell flat.  Bland, boring, way overpriced.  Not sure what they're thinking with this place.  Oh, and they're too cool for chips.  Ugh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has a lot of potential. The service was excellent and friendly. The menus are very limited. Breakfast only served until 11:00, and no chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, chorizo scramble, etc. Nothing looked that appealing on the lunch menu. Instead of following my instincts and leaving for Gallo Blanco, I ordered the Pollo burrito, which was small, very bland and overpriced at $8. The sandwich of the exact variety was $12. The salsa served with it was green, runny, and somewhat hot, but otherwise  flavorless. The side of fundito soup just tasted salty. I didn't taste any pickled onions. I honestly would have been better off at Taco Bell, and I was hungry two hours later...\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a little of everything ... we started with the Vegetarian Quesadilla and the Chile Colorado w/ 2 Eggs.  Then we had a bowl of the Menudo. We also ordered the hand made corn tortillas.  Needless to say, the food was superbly delicious and authentic; reminded me of home.  We had to try the Palomas drink as well as Bloody Maria and Bloody Mary.  They too were well proportioned and very refreshing. In summary, everything about our meal and drinks was exceptional!!!\n\nOur server Samson was great!  The ambiance is great too!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ambiance is good. Food not that great. Food portions are small, everything is alacarte.  Desserts were awful.Bathrooms did not like anyone could come in, women could be in the bathroom with a man & you do not know what kind of person that man is.Thank God place not for Kids at all\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland's cafe is supposed to be a combination of two worlds but it's lack of adequate customer service and food taste makes it subpar with other modern mexican restaurants in the valley . The location and ambience is quite good. The restaurant wants to be known for its flavor of Italian with Mexican specifically chihuahua style food. In that category it has failed miserably food lacks salt ,taste and quality. I excepted a lot from this place after seeing amazing pictures on Instagram of the food presentations which indeed live up to the pictures. Customer service ,the fact that it takes a waiter ten minutes to get coffee and then another ten to bring creamer is absurd. The place is new and it might take a while to get rolling but I hope reviews like mine can help you indeed grow and refine your restaurant. Make the people of chihuahua proud fresh tortillas menudo etc, all those kinds of foods but in a modern setting is amazing now just make it taste better and you will be above everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was just fine. Cute decor, the drinks were good but the food lacked flavor and love. I had been excited to try this place, and even more excited about the location, but it just fell flat. Another note, they are severely lacking in vegetarian options, which is a bummer because central Phoenix has a large vg population. We ended up going to a Mexican place down the road after to get more food. I'd say maybe go if you're in the area, but don't go out of the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in for lunch on Labor Day. Parking lot was full, but plenty of street parking available. It's a great historic looking building and quite spacious inside. Our server seemed a bit inexperienced, but was friendly. Not a huge menu, but everything seemed reasonably priced. Mostly Mexican lagers on the beer list, bit did have some good local beers on tap as well. We tried the Colorado burrito because it had gotten some rave reviews. Really wasn't that impressed. It had good flavor and was wrapped in a tasty tortilla, but the  pork was kind of gristley and chewy. We will be back to try something different, and hope for a better result.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friend brought us food from here and it was so delicious. I'm super picky when it comes to Mexican food so for me to say it's really good is a major compliment!!! I would recommend it and im going to take my husband and he's even pickier than I am.\n\n\n\n\n\nI viewed this as a can't miss prior to going since you can't miss at Tacos Chiwas or any of Bianca's restaurants. \n\nI was right.\n\nWe went for a Saturday afternoon lunch. I got the Chile colorado burrito and a carne asada taco while my wife ordered the entomatadas. All three were fantastic and despite carne asada tacos being one of my top 5 things in the world it probably ranked 3rd yesterday. That's just how good the burrito and the entomatadas were. Chile colorado had the perfect spice level and great flavor. Meanwhile, with the entomatadas, I don't really know how to explain. It was almost like cheese enchiladas with an enchilada/vodka sauce flavor. There was a hint of that Bianco Italian flavor...it was awesome.\n\nJust when we thought we were satisfied, we were offered a sponge cake dessert with a layer of banana custard/pudding and this was the star of the day. I don't seal out dessert, but this is so special that we got another one to go to bring to my brother and we decided to just eat it ourselves instead.\n\nOn top of all the great news above, our service was fantastic. I didn't catch her name, but she made he lunch even better as she was pleasant and had great recommendations.\n\nGet here.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the food- The mix of Mexican food reminds me of what I would eat when I was growing up with a twist Coffee bar is great...great open/casual atmosphere. Very chill.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat experience all the way around. The entematadas were exceptional; the red sauce was so fresh and delicious and the blend of flavors, perfection! My friend had a veggie quesadilla with mushrooms and spinach and was equally satisfied. The servers were  warm, friendly, accommodating  and very professional. \n\nHighly recommend. I can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne word! Delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the chorizo cheese quesadilla.  The tortilla was perfectly crisp, the cheese superior, and the chorizo spicy but not hot and full of flavor.  My Chile Colorado plate was very good.  The pork in the red Chile was very tender.  My only complaint was they need to have the red Chile in some juice/ sauce because the meat was tender and moist but you need to have enough sauce to dip your tortilla in like Mexicans like me do when we eat! \n\nService was good. Made you feel loved like you were eating at your Nana's house.  Home vibe.  Beautiful mural inside, clean, original ceiling with crown molding. We'll be back For Sure! \n\n5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall a disappointing experience. After reading about this place and seeing the Yelp reviews, we were excited to check out Roland's for brunch. I should've noticed the big red flag when all of the Yelp reviews were from Elite members...special treatment or event maybe?\n\nWe arrived around 10:45 on a Saturday to be told that breakfast ends at 11. For a week day I understand, but I've never seen a place end breakfast so early on a weekend. I guess they don't want a brunch crowd? We were waiting for friends and I specifically asked the waiter if it'd be a problem if we ordered breakfast a few minutes after 11 once our friends got there. He went to ask the kitchen and came back assuring us that there wouldn't be a problem. I guess this was a total lie. We placed our coffee and breakfast order and got ready for a fun brunch. A few minutes after we ordered a different staff person came to our table and told us we needed to change our order. I explained that we were told it wouldn't be a problem but he didn't really seem to care.\n\nThe items we did order for lunch were all mediocre at best. The French fries were good but that's about it. We were extremely disappointed and expected better customer service from a restaurant from such acclaimed chefs. 2 stars for decor and overall vibe.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the Pollo Asado Sandwich!  Great atmosphere, good prices, great staff.  Also loved that their ceiling and building is over 100 years old.  Will be our new hang out!\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon arriving, the parking lot was full but luckily there was a spot open right at the front during Saturday brunch. The restaurant is spacious and the windows are great with the brick exposed. The kitchen is open and there's a coffee bar right as you walk in. We got water immediately and the service was friendly, consistent, and quick. \n\nOrdered the red chile pork which I felt lacked that authentic red chile flavor and it was a little dry for my taste. I'm used to my grandma and mom's red-chile which is more of a soup and deep chile flavor without it being spicy. My daughter agreed that salt was missing. The beans were whole, which I wished were mashed instead, and the eggs were just as expected with a side of what looked like a fresh flour tortilla. This dish was disappointing though.\n\nThe chicken tinga tostadas were plated nicely and full of meat and toppings. It comes with a side soup which I thought was salty, which was opposite of the red chile. This dish was better than the red chile though, but I wouldn't come back to try anything else.\n\nIt was overpriced, and the flavors weren't there for me. It's no surprise who is giving high reviews, given they're not familiar with home cooked Mexican food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friend  spoke very highly  if this restaurant.  Parking is a problems. The plates we got had caked on dirt . Two out of four plates . We had the chorizo quesadilla.  It was dry open faced and not much cheese . We had their salad whi h came  on a large bowl . We asked for dressing on the side but it came mixed . It was a lime dressing which was light. We had the steak sandwich however the bread was o early crunchy.too much dressing.  We ordered the red burro . It was ok . Portion was small. Service was good .place was new and clean. Was hungry in three hours. . I was interested  in other  items but only served  for  breakfast or dinner\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to the new Roland's Cafe for breakfast this morning and left with such a satisfied feeling to start my Saturday.  Was pleased off the bat to find Roland's offered fresh-squeezed, orange juice to kick off my day.  I sat facing the window and unexpectedly noticed Camel Back Mountain.  Roland's Cafe is on Van Buren west of 16th St., where the mountain is east of 44th St and Lincoln, this fact did not diminish the most pleasant view from this cafe.  An urban setting with the mountain in the background is just what I like.  \nMy order of rice bowl with veggies and an egg arrived.  I also included refried beans and corn tortillas on the side.  The brown rice was well-cooked as were the veggies.  The egg was sunny side up and mixed well with the rest of the meal.  I ordered four, freshly-made, corn tortillas and refried beans then proceeded to chow on the salsa trio with green chili, green sauce and red sauce.  \nA dessert was in the offing when I asked if they bake their own stuff.  The choices were awesome from sugar cookies to scones.  I picked a rye cookie that was nicely baked with cinnamon and sugar.\nThe view of the mountain made the trip special to Roland's cafe and the food is gonna bring me back for more.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive stars for the Love. Easy to see and feel the love hear. From the thoughtful design to the engaging staff to the well thought out menu easy to see everyone is on the same page. Could the execution of each item be a tad better?  Sure and I am positive that will improve. Two of us tried about seven dishes, all thoughtfully prepared. Only disappointment was dessert.  We would have really liked Some better choices. Besides that superb. P/s I've owned a dozen restaurants over 35 years. Wishing you well...oh and Dave did s great job\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there expecting something delicious wanting me to go back after the first bite.  But sadly to say not intrigued. Tacos are mediocre at best. I order the carnitas and the steak(carne asada). Carnitas was dry not a lot of flavor.  Steak was just ok.   Then I had a taste of their \"quesadillas\" open face. The chorizo wasn't great.  Then my friend had the tostadas it was just ok. I think I enjoy the fideo soup better than the other items.  \n\nWould not be back unfortunately. I hope they change their menu a bit. I know they just open which I hope it gets better thru time.  Definitely will not recommend it.  \n\nService was great.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here with some coworkers, and we were all incredibly pumped to try the food because of the big names behind the restaurant. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. The fideo was new to me and delicious, the salsa fresh and flavorful, but the portions were small. Plus, I only enjoyed my meal after dousing it in salsa, and I'm personally of the mind that salsa should enhance, and not serve as the main flavor for a food item. My coworkers who got the sandwiches were very satisfied, so I'll probably come back again for that.\n\nIn general, I would give the food 3 stars, but the service was beyond excellent (especially for such a large party) so I decided to give it a 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nCool, creative restaurant with an industrial vibe. Went with a coworker for Friday lunch, despite being nearly 1:00 it was busy so we sat at the bar.  There was ample parking on the side street and in a gravel lot next door, some previous reviews mentioned limited parking but it was not a problem for us. Friendy bartender and good, quick service. Tried both the pork  and chicken tinga tacos. Both were very good, especially the chicken. The tacos are not huge but had a good amount of meat and were filling. Our server told us they mill their own corn and flour for the tortillas, pretty impressive. I also got a side of roasted vegetables which I would highly recommend. My coworker had a burrito which he said was excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat new spot on Van Buren! Pretty hip decor and open space. A small but well executed menu. Since they're newer, it's easy to get a table on the weekend. Nice craft cocktail and beer selection. The side of roasted veggies is a good accent to any entree. Would highly recommend checking this place out!\n\n\n\n\n\nA new place with a new feel!  The menu is diverse and the staff is AMAZING!  Jack was our server and Brit was our barista.  Our four top had a range of food including the Mortadella Quesadilla (recommended by Jack), the Empaadas (with green chili, garbanzo bean dip), and the delightfully spicy Chile Colorado.  Brit hooked us up with a variety of caffeinated delights.  This place is perfect for you if you are looking for a modern take on traditional Mexican fare in an environment that has a galvanizing energy in a gentrified neighborhood.  Be sure to ask your server for his/her recommendation on the menu and sample something new.  You won't be disappointed!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first time not our last! Great Mexican food we loved the citrus salad as a starter. The quesadilla with chorizo was really my favorite. The quality of the food was 5 star. The red chili burrito was very tasty and not too spicy. Really great drinks  from the bar especially the Paloma.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ambiance is good. Food not that great. Food portions are small, everything is alacarte.  Desserts were awful.Bathrooms anyone could come in, women could be in the bathroom with a man. Did not feel really comfortable. This is Not a place for kids. I speak the truth.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been excitedly watching and waiting for Roland's to open for months as we are big fans of Tacos Chiwas and Bianco concepts.  We arrived last night (Saturday) at about 6:45pm and the restaurant was about 3/4 full and the bar was empty.  The hostess wasn't at the front but the bartender noticed us and sent her over.  Her mood was crabby and bothered.  She asked us if it was just the two of us and then guided and squeezed us between chairs from two occupied tables to get to our table rather than walking around politely.  Not another word came out of her mouth.  We sat for a few minutes looking at the menu before our server came over who was just as flat and uninterested in his job as the hostess.  He took our drink (sangria and cuba libre which my husband said was probably the best cuba libre he has ever had) and food orders and left.  I continued to watch all of the staff in the restaurant throughout our meal and no one seemed very happy and hardly any of them talked to each other.  It was almost as if they had all just been reprimanded for something and they were irritated.  Not a single smile throughout the restaurant, including the huge bar which gained about 4 patrons while we were there.\nThis restaurant is really neat inside.  Great original tin ceilings and exposed brick and the decor was modern with a vintage vibe.  The bar is giant and would be fun to sit at, if it was full of life.  I was thrilled to see the mortadella quesadilla on the menu, as I really love the mortadella sandwich at Pane Bianco.  My husband and I enjoy creative food chocked with layers of flavor so a quesadilla is not normally something I would order.  It had a lot of cheese (maybe too much), perfect mortadella, red onion, and avocado but it was missing something.  It needed something else like a spicy crema or some sort of acidic addition drizzled over the top.  It was a bit bland aside from the red onion and tasted like kid food, not an adult quesadilla.  My husband had the wood fired tostada which he enjoyed but the fideo soup wasn't hot, just barely warm.  Our server never came back to ask us how our meal was.  When we finished our food, he brought us our check.  No asking us about dessert or another drink, nor did we even see a dessert menu (found out afterward that they have choco flan...mmmm!).  We paid our tab and left.  It was a total of 30 minutes from the time we entered until the time we left.  This place is super cool inside and would be fun to linger for a few drinks at the bar, if the staff actually seemed like they enjoyed their jobs and engaged their audience.  We eat out every weekend, sometimes twice, and usually with friends.  We live in Central Phoenix where new, creative restaurants are continually popping up, some that are amazing and some that are just meh.  With all of these new options in Phoenix you had better wow your guests the second they walk through the door, or at least be friendly and happy otherwise you will lose them to the ones who do.  Service with a smile and a little conversation is everything.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a huge disappointment. Given the ownership pedigree and after reading all the online reviews I expected a better experience. There must not have been a manager on duty today because the inmates were clearly running the asylum. I waited at the hostess stand for close to 10 minutes and was ignored by two servers and a barista who saw me but did not acknowledge me or offer to seat me.  I finally asked one of them if I had to seat myself or if there was someone seating people and she said \"you can just sit over there\" and pointed me to a table. When my lunch companion showed up we had to take menus that were left on the table next to us since no one brought us menus. And when they finally brought us food we had to ask for silverware to eat it with. And then she walked away and came back with side dishes but again no silverware. The best happened when we got our check.  The waitress told us she had given the table next to us the wrong check - she gave them our check and they paid it and left already so she was giving us their check but it was OK because it was less money and we got the better part of the deal. With employees like that this place won't be in business much longer. Oh and the food was fine.  The presentation was nice and it tasted good but it was nothing special.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love finding new places in downtown Phoenix!  Yummy food, delicious drinks - get the corn  Elote en Vaso as an appetizer. It is small I did not share mine ;) LOVE the salsa!\nThe wood burning fire smell is intoxicating and adds to the experience!\nSuper fun atmosphere - bathroom is fun...\n\n\n\n\n\nWas excited to come here after reading the reviews and the founder backgrounds. The elote was to die for! Could make a meal out of it, but sadly they don't offer chips!\nHad the vegetarian enchiladas. Very good. The sauce was outstanding. My friend had the Colorado burro. It was awesome tasting but very small portion. Was hoping to be wowed more than I was.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped for breakfast at the new Roland's the other day.  Ordered chili colorado breakfast -- really good!  Atmosphere is good.  Service good.  Owners/chefs were all there and stopped by and chatted for a sec which is pretty cool.\n\nI'll definitely go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG! This place is super cute...I love the decor, they really hit it out of the park with this one. The play on Southwest design meets modern is a perfect pair. It has all of the things that I look for in a restaurant: a bar, co-ed bathrooms (a changing table/btw this should be mandatory), an area to accommodate large parties, friendly staff and great food! But wait, there is more, they even have a coffee bar with ROC2 coffee! I got the Pollo sandwich, my husband got the Asada sandwich and my daughter devoured the cheese crisp. Each where equally satisfying as the next. I also ordered the Cactus Soda (no alcohol for this breastfeeding mama), and it was super refreshing on this 100+ Arizona day! I am counting down the minuets till I go back, maybe next time a little spike in my drink\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly Cow!! This place is fantastic! Had the Mexican salad with the steak. Steak is flavorful and tender. Greens are fresh, and dressing delicious. Food is tasty, and fresh, and service is the best. These people are simply put, very good at putting together great food. The atmosphere is wonderful. Original tile ceilings in this cool old building. The tile is beautiful and the big windows are as nourishing as the food. Yum!\n\n\n\n\n\nI think it was a little pricey for the size of the burrito and instead of fideo, I would to pick the side.  Also I was charged for 2 ice teas so not sure if they charge per refill. Green Unsweetened tea was very good, the Colorado burrito was superb, this is the closest red Chile at a restaurant that has tasted as good as my parents New Mexican Chile! Love that they use Schreiners pork. Fideo was good, like the lime added. I also liked the roasted veggies. \nIt's in a cool remodeled building, but the acoustics suck, could barely hear the people at my table.  I would not mind going back to try the coffee bar, get a pastry or a burrito to go!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I heard about this new culinary venture, featuring two of my FAVORITE restaurants in the Valley, I was SO excited. I finally got to try it today! Tacos Chiwas + Pizzeria Bianco lovers unite! \n\nThe concept is primarily Mexican food, but with Bianco twists like the perfect crunchy bread, rustic decor, and the quesadillas looked a bit different and more 'doughy' like pizza would + were open faced. I ordered their Steak Sandwich and it was so flavorful! It had guacamole and beans on it, served with a side of delicious salsa. I ordered salad as my side and it was simple with a really tasty, tangy dressing. My friend and I split fries as well and they were a little oily for my liking, that would be my only complaint! \n\nAll in all, this is an adorable new spot near Downtown with fresh, tasty Mexican food... i'd recommend giving it a shot. Their breakfast menu looks tasty as well. Parking may be a bit of a challenge but there was a dirt lot next door and street parking as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame in for breakfast and coffee. Soon as you walk in, everyone is friendly and welcoming. We had the chorizo and machaca burrito, they come with potatoes. Very filling if you have a big appetite. Quality of the food is well thought out and done with love. They could improve coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n$10 mimosas?  Ouch.  But, my fault for not asking the price before ordering.  Maybe it would have been a different story had the pours been generous.  The food we had was good, but it will take some time for the alcohol sticker shock to wear off before we'll be back to try more menu items.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot impressed. We decided to try this new place on a Saturday afternoon after reading online articles about how great it was. We were limited to a weekend brunch menu with not a whole lot to choose from, especially if you don't eat meat. The items we ordered were nothing to write home about, with a boring presentation & no garnishes whatsoever. The service & water were good and we were entertained by the restroom concept. It feels like we wasted our money & our Saturday lunch opportunity, though. Won't be back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If anything is good for pounding humility into you permanently, it's the restaurant business.\"  Anthony Bourdain\n\nRoland's = The beautiful lovechild of Taco Chiwas and Pizzeria Bianco!\n\nWhen the glamorous Phoenix CM, Hailey P., invites you to lunch, you go and get lunch.  It's a no-brainer!  She knows all the best places and she's the sweetest!\n\nI had a beautiful order of Entomatadas that had corn tortillas; fluffy asadero cheese; fresh crispy lettuce; and covered in a sweet, bright, tomato sauce that was topped with crema fresca. It was bite after bite of balanced flavors and I was looking down at an empty plate in no time.  I also snagged a few of Hailey's fries which I dipped in the tomato sauce of my entomatadas.  Delightful!\n\nOn the way out, we got to see Chris Bianco himself with a box of bread.  He was all smiles and it made me smile.  Great energy from a wonderful guy!  ;D\n\nRoland's is a gorgeous new collaboration between Taco Chiwas's owners, Nadia Holguin and Armando Hernandez, and the famed James Beard Award winner Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco.  What a fierce and flavorful trifecta!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a concept from Chris Bianco (pizzeria Bianco) and the owner of Tacos Chiwas. I wouldn't expect anything less than delicious from either of them, and my expectations were definitely met! I highly recommend the chorizo quesadilla - I could have eaten 5 of these. Cocktails are pretty good, but I'd like to see a few spicy options.\n\nWe sat at the bar and service was a bit slow, but I think this is mostly due to new opening jitters.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have had both breakfast and dinner here in the last month.  The food, ambiance and service were all excellent.  We tried about 10 different dishes for dinner--veggie quesadilla, carnitas and steak tacos, chicken tinga tostada, Chile Colorado burrito, cabeza/cheeks empanadas, roasted veggies, fideo soup, and for dessert tres leches and chocolate flan cake.  We all agreed that everything was unique and outstanding, except the soup and flan which were OK but not great.  It was uncrowded and quiet at breakfast on a weekday, but crowded and loud on Friday evening.  I would sit in the back for quieter conversation.  And very reasonably priced, especially given the quality.  The neighborhood is primarily used car lots, but seems safe during business hours.  Roland's instantly became one of my favorite restaurants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tacos are solid. Similar to Tacos Chiwas, which is expected. I had one of each: beef, chicken and pork. \n\nThe star of the meal was the desert. Needless to say, the tart was incredible. \n\nService was incredible. Highly recommended, especially for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland's was developed by Chris Bianco from Pizzeria Bianco and the folks from Taco Chiwas. The result isn't a fusion but a merge of cooking styles. The quesadillas are cooked in a pizza oven and are absolutely fantastic. I had the veggie quesadilla with fresh spinach, mushrooms, onion, and cheese. It was crisp and fresh. I also had their cookies and coffee. This is a great place and I'm excited to see it thrive. They're coffee and service was fantastic!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service, great food. Authentic experience. Impressed with this place. No complaints.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeg and I wanted to go to this place since we heard about it, and it definitely did not disappoint. The ambiance is straight up Chris Bianco vibe with the comfort of walking into a welcoming place. Tacos Chiwas' Nadia Holguin and Armando Hernandez are incredible and their flavors show it! We tried the machaca burrito and chorizo quesadilla and they were both soo flavorful. I added an egg to the quesadilla and the creaminess was wonderful. The coffee is stellar!  Dinner service will happen in 8 days or so and looking forward to returning for that service as well.  So great to see incredibly good talent showcased.  This is a definite go-back!!  Dr. B\n\n\n\n\n\nNot sure what the hoopla is about. Average food. Average service.  Had the burrito and a pollo taco. Decent. Had the cherry brownie...dry. I've never thought as much for Bianco pizza either (same chef) so maybe I'm missing something?\n\n\n\n\n\nTook my mom here for lunch .... she loved it! It was authentic and very flavorful. The fideo brought back so many memories and the salsa was fresh, tortillas were absolutely wonderful! Home made! Atmosphere was nice, service was excellent! If you want a cup of coffee and a scone, they can take care of that too!\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally got to check this out.  We sat at the bar which we like to do at a new place.  Bartender was David. He is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and made suggestions.  It was a light dinner so we had the Chicken Tinga and Empanadas.  Both were excellent and amazingly filling.  We finished off with the Bread Pudding.  Great service and reasonably priced.  I'll be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really like that they re-purposed the old building.  It has a lot of character.  The food is very flavorful and they have a nice selection on the various menus.  The service is very friendly and informative.  The drinks are super delicious.  I hope that they add on some outdoor seating.    See you soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to like this place, I really did. The food was just okay. If they're going to have a limited menu, it better be amazing. It's not. Tasted two different burritos--nothing special. The French toast came out soggy and eggy. And the small bowl of $11 menudo...left me sad and hungry. I feel like this place is having an identity crisis--and it just opened. Feels like a farmhouse market, has mediocre Mexican food, and a random mix of pastries. On a positive note, the coffee was great and the service was top notch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are only open till 3pm and still working out the details...I love it!  The feel is casual and special at the same time.  An awesome collaboration between chefs!  Both dishes I tried \"worthy\" in my book!  I am hoping they will add something vegan and gluten free to the menu!Yes, I will be back for a second visit!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome atmosphere, killer food and a wine list that has great wine at fair prices.  Serene environment that deserves your business\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this new addition to downtown Phoenix. The vibe is casual and the space itself is beautifully decorated - light filled & airy. We ordered a few quesadillas and they were delicious - the light, crispy \"tortillas\" were to die for. Will definitely be back this week to grab a coffee & pastry for breakfast, and again soon to try the other menu items!\n\n\n\n\n\nVeggie quesadilla - after one bite of this wood fired delight, I knew I would be happy with our decision to try Roland's. The smokey, grainy flavor of the crust was reminiscent of Bianca's, but the subtle medley of flavors were unidentifiably unique and satisfying. My husband had the Chile Colorado Burrito. His description: \"tender morsels of pork in Chile Colorado sauce had the perfect level of heat and a great savory flavor. Appears small, but is packed with flavor and is quite filling.\" Our friend commented and we agreed, \"you love it more with every bite\"!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a fan of Chris Bianco, have heard good things of Tacos Chiwas (on my list of places to eat), and really wanted to like Roland's but it fell short of my expectations. The restaurant itself is nice, spacious and has a pretty cool bar. Upon walking in I did notice an odd smell I couldn't place, it wasn't terrible just odd. I was one of the last people to join our large group and upon sitting down, I was not offered a menu or water that I noticed the rest of the table had. We proceeded to order drinks, during which time I did ask for a glass of water. Later we placed our food orders. It took a long time for our drinks to arrive, and once they did I still did not receive a water. Shortly after our drinks arrived, our food was served. I was impressed how quickly our food came out, it smelled and looked delicious. I ordered the Entomatadas which was corn tortillas, cheese, cabbage, cream, quest fresco and cilantro. The flavor profile sounded like it would be delicious but instead it left something to be desired. It was completely bland, I needed a kick, some spice, anything! The crispness of the cabbage/lettuce did balance the softness of the tortillas, cheese and sauce giving it a much needed texture boost. The crema was good, but I don't think I would order this dish again. I did try some chorizo from my friend's plate and that was actually very good. I wish I had ordered a chorizo dish, it was flavorful and did have a little bit of a kick to it. Overall, I was rating based on my own experience with the dish I had and it was okay. Will I be back? Probably not, but if you do go please do yourself a favor and try their chorizo.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent!  Went there with my husband and some friends... the food was AMAZING!  The food came all at once, so if you want an appetizer before your main course, make sure to specify.  I don't remember the names of all the menu items, so my version (i.e. main ingredients) are listed, sorry I can't find the menu we had online :-)  \n\nThe Elote Corn (I don't remember what it was called on the menu [1st item on the menu], but I could have eaten 5 orders of this dish), the mussels in a smoky tomato sauce (mussels were fresh from Nelson's Meat and Fish - LOVE that place and the tomatoes were worth licking the plate clean), the steak sandwich (to-die-for), and the pork burrito (not as good as the steak sandwich, but tasty).  Our friends also had the Mortadella quesadilla (I can't comment on because I am not a fan of mortadella) and the Entomatadas (which were gone before you could pronounce the name).\n\nWe went on a Monday night, so it was not too busy, but the parking lot was still full, leading us to park on the street.  The atmosphere was casual and I can't wait to go back and try everything from their menu!\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here on a random Wednesday evening for their happy hour which was $2 off their drinks. Not the best happy hour for drinks but they have decent cocktails.\n\nOrdered their chorizo \"quesadilla\" which is open face (no top tortilla). It was surprisingly very delicious. Though it looks more like a pizza, I actually prefer it without the top tortilla. I could see myself coming here again but more for their food and cute atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll be back I had the carnitas sandwich and the fries!!! I recommend it, heard the bar area is pretty lively at times too.  Awesome decor\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, this building is stunning. \nSecond, my lunch was delectable. Polo tacos and quesadillas. I am committed to eating a side of vegetables every visit. They were wood fired grilled. This is my very first time in life looking forward to eating vegetables they were so great!\nFinally, there is one main reason we will be back to eat at Roland's.....the staff. You can have the best food and building, but if your employees lack enthusiasm then patrons are going to see and easily feel this transference. Since we dined for lunch, we decided to sit at Roland's gorgeous and large bar. We were greeted by a handsome bartender, Elijah. This guy is super happy to be at Roland's. His smile is huge behind his chunky glasses. He clearly knows the menu, however he describes dishes with great enthusiasm and passion.  I was convinced this guy made the food himself! I highly recommend Roland's. More so, I highly recommend keeping Elijah around. He's fantastic for business!\n\n\n\n\n\nBianco & Chiwas knocked it out of the park.  Luv the old building n tin ceiling texture with the red brick.   The pork chop was great.  The wifey had the menudo rojo was good she would have like some condiments oregano etc but it was very good she said. This kids had breakfast fast salad also good.  Boys had bean n cheese it was very good beans with fresh tortillas. The papas were soft and tasty.  Desert lemon cake very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat new spot tucked away in a beautiful historic building. Good food and atmosphere. The only downside was that the waiter we had didn't seem to be as knowledgeable when it came to the menu or have the awnsers to my questions. Perhaps he was new and was still being trained.. I don't know. I still give this place 4 stars overall!\n\n\n\n\n\nNoisy, or should I say extremely noisy. I would think that veteran  restaurateurs would take this into their design. Food was average, but the experience was uncomfortable, without yelling you could not have a conversation across the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hearing plenty of positive buzz about this new restaurant's Chili Colorado, I had to try it myself. The magic is not just in the chili itself--which, in my humble opinion is world-class--it lies in the harmonic balance between the various components (artisan home-made organic wheat tortilla; creamy beans; chewy,  yet tender enough cubed pork; and of course, the smokey 1red chile itself which is at that perfect happy medium within the heat scale--mild enough to not set one's mouth ablaze; but with enough character to cause the taste buds to go into a tizzy.\n  I can also rave about the Chili Colorado burrito's side of fideo soup that I can probably consume a bucket full of every week and never grow tired of...\n  Finally, while at the restaurant, I observed the ownership team ( Armando; his brother, Jon; Seth; and Chris Bianco) making a conscientious, likely natural, effort to connect with patrons during intervals when they were not bogged down with the demands of focus, detail, and hard work; which I was very impressed with and thought conducive towards cultivating a warm, friendly ambience certain to garner a repeat customer base.\n\n\n\n\n\nincredible food. the dessert we had (potato doughnuts with a caramel sauce) was the best dessert I've had in my life. The old fashioned I had was wonderful, too-- and the servers were very kind. \n\nhighly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure how I landed on following Roland's IG page, but that's how it started. They run a great social media presence and the food looks DIVINE in the photos shared. So I dragged my husband to go and give it a try. The restaurant is quite spacious and you do not feel overly crowded to your neighbor. They have set it up in that sense perfectly! We went at around 10:30 on a Saturday. We saw they have a bar area that looked cool and we already decided we would be back. \n\nOur waitress (Natalie) was great! She got our orders in pretty quickly and we also got some coffee (cappucino and americano). Our food came out fast...but the drinks did not. It was weird considering they were not super busy. But they got super lucky because not only was Natalie super nice and sweet (so we did not get too ornery about the situation) but the coffee after the food worked out nice as we just sipped and talked some after...allowing the food to settle I suppose. \n\nThe food was amazing for the both of us and we had several other menu items we wanted to try so we will for sure be back. We both wiped our plates clean! I had the Chile Colorado and my husband had the Chorizo Quesadilla with egg on top. My husband really dug the salsa...he actually said it is good, HOT salsa...a rarity because most places cater to those with a weaker tolerance to the SPICY stuff. \n\nI can see where parking may be an issue but since we went over Labor Day weekend it was not crowded at all. We will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a dope place to eat - in general. Come for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or drinks. You'll enjoy it all because of the great environment, friendly staff, and good selection of options to devour. \n\nUpon entry, the staff was nothing but courteous and helpful. Our waiter was consistently attentive but not to the point of annoying. He provided some great suggestions and updated us on the building history (former car dealership). \n\nI ordered the veggie quesadilla. This was the first open faced quesadilla I've tried and it was great. I added a few of their salsas on top and that combined with the cheese was f'ing delectable. Since it's essentially the size of a pizza I was able to save half for when I went to the airport later in the day. I also ordered a side of the potatoes. They are drenched in olive oil and some herbs. It's a great side dish. My dad ordered some sort of breakfast combo. He loved it all and wanted to try something else at the end.\n\nI'd absolutely recommend a visit. It's in a random location but provides ample off-street parking.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was excited to check out the soft opening for Roland's Cafe Market Bar.   I am giving them a soft 5 stars for the first round.  Upon entering, I liked the hospitality, the dcor with the succulents as table centerpieces and found it to be nothing flashy but appreciated the fresh, contemporary look with soft Mexican kitchen touches.  The open kitchen concept is welcome and the acoustics seem okay for conversation for such a large space.  \n\nThey had ROC^2 coffee on drip with an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean.  Very nice.  Other coffee offerings (I had to ask) were a Spanish coffee with powdered milk and a Mexican mocha.  The barista was very knowledgeable so mad respect there.  I asked what the faves on the menu were and the response was \"anything with chorizo.\"  I can now agree with that 100%.  I had the Chorizo Quesadilla and WOW.  Something so simple was so well done.  Paired with the ROC^2 Coffee, I couldn't have asked for better.  \n\nI am also impressed with the logistics that went into ensuring the finest quality ingredients were part of the process:  \"Recently, Armando [Hernandez] drove down to Chihuahua to pick up 500 pounds of chiles.  He did this just so that his chile Colorado would taste a shade more like the ones from home.\" (Source: Phoenix New Times Article, Chris Malloy, April 17, 2018.)  Now that is dedication to excellence.  I really want this place to make it.  \n\nOther notables include gender neutral bathrooms and an open hand washing concept.   Soft five stars will become hard five stars once they fix logistics: flies in the baked goods display case because there was no backing to keep them out; to-go waiting area bench gave me wood splinters in my pants; no coffee drink descriptions; ALL forgiving because brand new for the first week.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow this place sure is busy! Walked in and the entire restaurant was basically full. They manage to get us a table for two and I started reading the menu and I just love how simple it is. We didn't have an \"assign\" server but the guy who served us took care of like 10 other tables! That's ridiculous. It took him awhile to get our order but it's alright, I understand because he was basically the only one. Our food came out and it was the wrong order! This guy must had a rough morning. They still managed to get our food out very quick and I was surprised at the portion size! It looks quite small but everything was just perfect and amazing. The burrito is so good! The chicken was not dry, beans was cooked right and their fries are amazing!!! I'm definitely going to come back to try their breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was so excited to check out this new place and it certainly did not disappoint! We stopped in for lunch a few weekends ago and had a great experience.  Rustic dining room that is very comfortable, great service and delicious food.  I had a non-alcoholic paloma (absolutely refreshing and so tasty) and the chicken tinga tostada with fideo soup - I think I could eat this every week.  We will definitely be back for tasty, reasonably priced food in a convenient location!\n\n\n\n\n\nVisited this place for the first time for brunch. The food was alright but the low rating is directly tied to the terrible service and ill-mannered manager on duty. After waiting 20-minutes to be seated when the restaurant was practically empty, several drink orders did not arrive for nearly 40-minutes after ordering. We reminded the server several times and upon inquiring with the manager he rudely interrupted before anyone could finish a sentence to explain \"you HAVE to be patient, it takes longer on the food orders for large parties\". After finally being able to speak, someone explained we were just inquiring about the drinks and he said he would take care of it. Twenty minutes later we had still not received the drinks. In addition, we waited over 90-minutes for our food without explanation for the delay. At no time did anyone take responsibility or apologize for the inconvenience. We would've happily accepted an explanation as to why things were operating so slow but nothing was ever communicated. We inquired with the manager about the bill to which he asserted we were \"on the attack\" and he has \"been in this business for 20-years\". His attitude was extremely dismissive from the moment we walked into the restaurant and he was nothing short of hateful the entire time. Again, we would've happily listened to an explanation for the less than desirable service but for some reason, the manager was quick to accuse customers. Unfortunately, we will not be returning due to the manager's inability to be professional and exhibit acceptable customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely delicious. I came here during my lunch hour and ordered their steak tacos. I wasn't sure on what to expect but was hoping it would be delicious since it has Bianco's and Tacos Chiwas names behind it. Boy was it fantastic. The meat was juicy and soft, tortillas where fresh and the salsas sure did have a kick!\nI will be coming back for a taco Tuesday lunch more often and try other delicious dishes from their menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nI visited Rolands with my husband and baby during their Sunday brunch hours. The food is decent but the service couldn't have been worse. We had to wait about 10 minutes after being seated for someone to come and greet us. My soda was flat and it wasn't until the middle on my meal that the server came and said their machine was out of carbonation. They were out of ice tea as well. There were no apologies, it was a take it or leave it attitude. Except for the manager, no one smiled or was welcoming... mind you they only had other 5 tables to take care off. I guess they don't want my business so I won't be going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSooo good. I recommend that you try one of each taco.  We sat at the bar, the bartender was so kind and a great conversationalist. I can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland's offers a simple and small seasonal menu which has so far been fantastic. I've only visited for brunch on three different occasions and it's been a great experience every time. I highly recommend their quesadillas, this is not something I would normally order at a restaurant since it's so easy to make at home. At Roland's it's different, their homemade tortillas and high quality ingredients make for an amazingly tasty, crispy, flavorful quesadilla. When I'm looking to eat healthier the breakfast salad does the trick, it's hearty, delicious, filling yet good for you. The bloody Mary is great too and I especially love the cajeta latte with goats milk caramel.\n\n\n\n\n\n$11 for a Michelada with the cheapest draft beer... ridiculous. I hate when restaurants try to get rich by selling one item. I get it there's a hype to check this place out, but the prices are outrageous.  I tried the Tinga tostadas,  the chicken was so old, and the chipotle sauce was not mixed right, it had no kick to it, I never got to taste the chipotle in it, they added to much water and tomatoes,  and I don't know where they get the sour cream from, but it tasted like water,  very disappointed-- tasted like if I was just eating old chicken on a sad tostada.  Tinga tostadas are supposed to be flavorful, I guess not in this joint....  The service was awkward, my friend and I were the only ones there and I kept waving my hand and getting up to order, because all the waiters were to busy talking and one of them keep sweeping the same corner the entire time we were there.... I'm not one to care for the service if the food Is good, but this time.... both were a fail - for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh Roland's, I want to love you, but, for now, I only like you. Your building and decor are gorgeous. I love tacos chiwas. I like Bianco. And I think there may be a few kinks to work out before you're great. I've been in twice, once for brunch and once for happy hour. I had the chili Colorado for brunch. The portion was large, but I was hoping for a bit more flavor. The best part was the delicious tortilla (mmmmm). The husband had the French toast, which was very tasty. I also had a latte with condensed milk that was awesome. Prices are high, as expected. For happy hour, a friend and I had a bit of an odd time. I had a fairly tasty drink with a slice of cactus fruit as a garnish (very nice) and my friend had a super boozy drink (less nice). We had a couple of issues, one being their shade didn't cove the window so we had some serious sun in our eyes (the bartended said they were fixing this, so it may not be an issue now), two- it seemed like the bartender that night was new and wasn't sure how to make the drinks (hopefully he's more trained now), and three the service was super slow. Despite this, the bartender ended up comping our drinks, even when we insisted on paying, which was super cool of him. I'll definitely give Roland's another shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestamente, este lugar tiene comida mexicana con un twist americano, y eso no es nada mal. La comida est exquisita y fresh.  Las tortillas estn hechas a mano, pero su elote en vaso si est en el lado dulcesito. En resume, este lugar tiene excelente servicio, y una televisin en que cambian el canal a tu gusto. 10/10\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a nice time at Roland's last weekend for lunch.  The parking can be a little tough if you don't want to have to park too far away in a sketchy neighborhood.\n\nThe building itself is light and bright with high ceilings.  I headed to the bar towards the back and was able to watch some of the World Cup soccer on the large TV.\n\nThe brunch menu on the weekends is slightly different than their regular menu.  I ordered the enchiladas montadas.  Instead of rolled tortillas they were a few flat tortillas stacked with the beans and cheese between the layers. The rojo sauce was delicious and it was topped with an egg.\n\nI also had a limeade which was very good but a little pricey I thought at $5.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile visiting from southern California, friends took us to Roland's for Sunday brunch.\nDelightful atmosphere and music. Building is historic with a lot of character.\nOur server was Mario. Very friendly and efficient.\nThe food was fresh and delicious!!!  We had the pork chops, citrus salad, quesadilla and organic brown rice with wood oven  roasted veggies.  All of the sauces were spot on.\nGreat coffee!  \n Bartender, Jack, made the best bloody Mary I have ever had. Nice guy too.\nAn interesting variety on the  menu. \nPrices are very reasonable. \nAll staff and manager were friendly and welcoming.\nCan't wait to come back to Roland's again when visiting Phoenix!!!\nSincerely,\nDeborah\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chile Colorado burrito is bomb. Get it! The enchiladas look amazing. Never tried them though. Building is super cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is tons of hype for this New Roland's Cafe Market Bar. The Bar was already set very high by our local newspaper stating that this could be one of Phoenix's Best New Restaurants. \n\nRoland's is a casual restaurant with wait service and a bar. This restaurant is a collaboration of James Bead Award Winning Pizza Guru Chef Bianco, The Owners of Tacos Chiwas and they sell Cutino Sauces (a collaboration of Bianco and Jacob Cutino ((formally known as Homeboy Sauces)) \n\nThe restaurant is casual. It very vintage but also accented with new. There is a large open kitchen and a very large bar. Above your head is a vintage tin ceiling and there is a very old brick wall with old filled in windows. They sell pastries and a few goods. The menu is mostly non traditional Mexican with a few Italian touches like a Mortadella Quesadilla.\n\nThe food served is of the highest quality. Bread and tortillas are ground locally and are made with local heirloom grains. The chicken used is free range organic. Everything is as local as possible and is the best!\n\nI ordered the Pollo Asado Sandwich. This is a very generously sized platter. The bread is obviously Bianco Bread and YES it is AMAZING. The bread is outstanding with a great crunch and great flavor. The chicken was tender like butter. It was expertly prepared. It seemed like it was either poached or slow cooked (sous vide?) and mild spices were added to the surface. It wasn't listed in the description so I don't know if this was in error or not......but my sandwich was spread with refried beans..........I didn't really like them. They had little flavor and felt like paste in my mouth. The chicken was very good but it had little flavor and was topped with slaw and a few pickled onions. On it's own this sandwich had little flavor. Then I added the Salsa Cruda on the side...WOW that sauce is really GREAT! That sauce was a BOMB. It turned a whisper into a SCREAM....The sandwich turned tasty when I added that delicious sauce. The side of vegetables was very generously sized and also was very good.\n\nMy husband had the Carnitas Sandwich. There were either typos or a few hiccups here. They used romaine (hopefully it wasn't from Yuma AZ) instead of arugula. But the main thing we both didn't like about this sandwich was the extra thick application of mayonnaise and refried beans. We both don't think mayonnaise and refried beans taste good together. ALSO MAYONNAISE is not listed on the menu for this sandwich and many people including my husband find mayonnaise polarizing. Our waiter was very understanding and agreed mayonnaise should be listed as an ingredient on the menu and quickly had a new sandwich for my husband without mayonnaise. That said he could tell the carnitas were well made and seemed like high quality but this sandwich whispered the flavors.....and the Salsa de Arbol was needed for flavor. That sauce was really great too.\n\nI took half my sandwich home so I'd have room to try a dessert.\n\nTodays selection were cookies, a Cherry Scone and something else that I forgot so I went with the Cherry Scone.\n\nI thought the pastry was good and it seemed to be baked to perfection but my half didn't contain any cherries....I think a cherry scone without cherries is a miss.\n\nParking was difficult. The lot and overflow lots were filled so we parked not too far on the street....Getting into the spot was easy but leaving was difficult because someone in a black Lincoln parked less than an inch in front of us and we couldn't back up much. \n\nTo some things up. Sandwiches are on amazing great bread and are painstakingly made with quality ingredients. Sandwiches are very mild but burst with lots of flavor when you add the Sauce. You may or may not be a fan of mayonnaise and refried beans on your Carnitas Sandwich. The Cherry Scone lacks enough cherries to be called a cherry scone. It was really an almond scone with trace amounts of cherry. Personally I would not order the sandwich or scone I had again. I can't say they were bad or anything like that but they weren't for my taste. I would however strongly recommend the Cutino sauces and purchase them. Our server was very understanding and attentive. Actually the whole staff was friendly and helpful.\n\nAt the time of this review Roland's is NEWLY OPENED (April 2018) and may or may not still be working things out. Your experience may differ.\n\nAfter the bugs are worked out there is strong potential for 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas excited to check this place out during their soft opening. The space is really cool, staff super sweet, and the playlist fantastic. \n\nThe drink list spins Mexican riffs on cocktail classics. I had the negroni (made with sotol) and B went with an old fashioned that used piloncillo as sweetener. Not bad and served in pretty glasses.\n\nFood was pretty good, too. Simple preparations with good ingredients.  \n- Loved the citrus salad- arugula, fruit, and a tasty dressing on the side\n- Veggie quesadilla- warm, soft, served open faced was ok. Just  don't expect a crispy/folded/cheese bomb\n- Carnitas sandwich- the meat inside was generous and tasty. I didn't notice any vinaigrette or salsa- if they were there, I wish there was more. The dishes of hot sauce they brought to the table were spicy. Good, but not the flavor I wanted to add. More salsa de arbol and lemon vinaigrette please! Came with a side of beans that were mmmmmm good.\n- Chile colorado burrito- Simple. Good quality meat rolled in a tortilla and crisped up. No rice, bean, guac, sour cream, cheese filling here. For some reason they brought a side of soup. It was ok, but I could've eaten more of the beans!\n- Rice bowl- again, just as described- rice topped with a roasted veg medley. No sauces, just simple.\n\nOur server was pushing the choco-flan for dessert. I'm not a cake fan and this one (a little dry, not sweet enough even with the flan on top) didn't win me over. The tres leches, though, that's a keeper! Cool, cream, topped with a few candied nuts. \n\nRCMB is an A-OK place to grab Mexican food close to downtown.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came in here for a co-workers birthday lunch! So, I haven't tried their drinks! I'll return back and report back!:) \nTheir salsas are amaaaazing! You get to choose from 3! 2 green and 1 red\nI got their steak sandwich and veggies! The waiter really talked them up, but mine came out really soggy and drenched.. he mentioned wood fired .. so I was really interested, but I wish I got the fries. I always wish for fries tho! The veggies are good, I just expected something different\nAppetizers and drinks next time!:)\n\n\n\n\n\nHad pretty high expectations for this place and these guys certainly met them.\n\nFirst off, the building itself is really interesting, particularly the ceiling -- dates back decades, cool design, well-preserved, etc.. For fear of failing to properly recount the history of the place, I will refrain here, but do yourself a favor and ask them about it. \n\nAnyways, I began with the Margarita -- fire flame game so swoll bang bang. I really recommend it. Just a solid, solid, no nonsense margarita.  The wheel is not reinvented but if it isn't broken, don't fix it (two idioms for the price of one -- you're welcome slash winky face). \n\nFood-wise, I treated myself to both the Carnita and the Pollo Taco. Again, like the Margarita, no nonsense. Nothing crazy or whacky here and that is because the dishes don't need it. Simple and proper cooking with great ingredients -- that is all it is and that is something to appreciate and admire.\n\nLastly, the TV at the bar was playing an old Godzilla movie that kept me thoroughly entertained. Thus, vibes fer days. Hell yeah.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously love this place. The food is fresh, clean, and tasty. I've recommended clients, friends, and family! \n\nSo why two stars? My initial \"bad\" encounter I didn't see the need to post as the GM said he'd handle it and having been in the industry, not everyone is perfect and I like to give benefit of the doubt. However, there was an employee who was there seemed to be by himself. We walked in and due to our diets (before we sat down) we just wanted to ask to see if they could accommodate a couple substitutions. I know some times it can be a pain. When I asked the server said\"well I'm not sure I can try to modify on the computer it didn't let me earlier so I don't know\"But before I could give a response he was quick to say and I kid you not \"so are you guys going to sit because if not i have other tables waiting on me to service\". He walked away before I could give an answer then and so my fianc and I walked out. That whole incident was less than a minute we went to breakfast club. I reached out to the GM sent him basically what's written above and said he'd take care of it. \n\nCool! Tried to call in an order the server didn't answer thank you for calling rolands. I was confused thought I had called the wrong number. I asked to sub chicken instead of pork due to religious reasons which is not a difficult substitution. Especially when I was informed prior by the GM that they do their best to accommodate dietary restrictions. (I have the messages). I told her I'd like to speak to someone else and she quickly changed her tone and gave an attitude. I hung up. My husband called to place the order. Same girl, answered the same way. Placed the order it was ALL wrong and also misinformed us on menu items. Which btw, it sucks when you're calling in for take out and there's no menu online. We asked to speak to someone else and Sidney or Cindy? Was amazing you get five stars!! \n\n\nI don't know if they got a bad batch of servers or if management is lacking in training. But twice? I mean the food is great but we are so turned off because we don't know what we are going to get as far as personalities that ... maybe it's not that good.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had high expectations for Roland's after hearing about it from a handful of trusted foodies.  Of course knowing the fact that the team behind this new concept is Tacos Chiwas + Pizzeria Bianco didn't hurt either... So when my husband suggested we head to Roland's on a recent date night, I was 100% onboard.\n\nWe were greeted right away when we walked in.  The space is gorgeous and well-done... it has a really cool, modern meets rustic vibe and whule clearly renovated, the restaurant manages to keep the charm from the distressed brick and the history of the building.  It's comfortable and casual and the staff seems to enjoy working there.\n\nWe sat at the bar and chatted with Alexandria and Davey, who were both super knowledgeable.  We watched the World Cup (nice touch with the TV at the bar) as well as the open kitchen behind us.  We also watched the attention to detail in the drinks being made... I'm definitely going to return to try some of those cocktails next time!\n\nThe food was excellent... we shared the Mexican Salad, Elote, Mussels, and a rice bowl with veggies and chicken.  We enjoyed everything we had! Portion sizes were generous and prices were fair... There were plenty of other items on the menu that were appealing, but our bellies could only handle so much.  The breakfast and lunch menus look solid too, so we'll have to return to try both!\n\nI know that a five star review after just one visit is a gamble, but I feel confident about this one... it's my kind of place and I look forward to returning real soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here with my brother in law about a month ago. The margaritas were really good and strong. The salsa is so good. Good enough that I asked if they would sell a pint to me to go, but they wouldn't. I got the special, which was green enchiladas. It was fantastic. \n\nHere is the only negative, I came back for a second time and it wasn't as good for brunch. We got some breakfast enchiladas or something and it was not good. I recommend coming here for dinner though!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first heard Armando Hernandez and Nadia Holguin of Chiwas fame were teaming up with Maestro Bianco I immediately put their endeavor at the top of my visit list.  It was with much anticipation that we made our visit.\nI left our maiden meal underwhelmed.  Granted, underwhelmed here is still better then 90% of the other offerings but I left with no real sense that this was truly unique or special.\nThe positives?  The corn and corn tortillas were among the best I've had.  The so so?  The steak sandwich was fine but the bread was too chewy and made the whole experience too laborious.  Also the service was very lackadaisical.\nAll in all, a solid meal that didn't live up to the fine pedigree of the initial offerings from these local legends.  And truth be told I'd likely visit Gallo Blanco, Tacos Chiwas, or one of the great spots on 16th street next time I'm in the area looking for Mexican.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first time I had been there and I was very impressed. Great location if you are going to a game. Each dish we had was very unique and flavorful, and had a kick. The desserts were to die for!! We shared both the tostadas and tacos, the \"bread pudding\" and donuts. Even the iced tea tasted freshly brewed. The tortillas are also freshly made and you can taste the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland's Market, a project that was originally going to be a Pane Bianco-Tacos Chiwas mashup, is a place with an end result that's more on the Mexican side of things, with traces of Italian thrown in. And when you have access to Bianco's resources and the right people at the helm, how can you go wrong?\n\nMy girlfriend and I have visited a couple of times. Please note that their lunch/dinner menu is identical, with the exception of a few additions that get added after 9pm during \"late hours.\"\n\nI really like their quesadillas. We've tried both the basic cheese, which consists of asadero and mozzarella, as well as one that incorporates chorizo. These pack excellent flavor and thrive on their simplicity, coming off more like a \"cheese crisp.\" It's a great example of how you can make something great with just using the simplest ingredients of the highest quality. Absolutely nothing else is needed.\n\nThe chile colorado burrito, which is something I don't see much of on local menus, was definitely on point, having just the right amount of spice and enough flavor to where, once again, you don't really need to add anything. I particularly love the flavor of the tortillas they use here.\n\nWe've also tried a steak sandwich that uses the Bianco bread similar to what you'd find over at Pane. Not the traditional flat bread, but the thicker style you'd find in more of his market sandwiches. In fact, it would fit right in with something I'd order for lunch over at that particular sandwich shop. \n\nOther experimentations, such as the chicken tinga tostadas and entomatadas are both well executed, but I still feel that their sandwiches and burritos are really where this place excels. The Nutella french toast, for example, is fine, but can easily be found elsewhere. My girlfriend, who loves enchiladas, finds the salsa roja to be a bit too spicy for her tastes - although I thought they were fine. \n\nFrench fries are on point, with a crispy exterior and very light interior. Beans and rice are okay, while the steak taco I ordered was also good, but not something I'd probably order again. Not because it's bad, but I feel this is kind of place that puts more emphasis on their other options as opposed to just tacos.\n\nFor dessert, they offer a variety of pastries. I really like their Mexican wedding cookies, which are crunchy, powdery, messy, and spectacular. Additionally, we sampled a sponge cake which was somewhat similar to a tres leches cake, only with banana cream packed inside. Excellent stuff! \n\nAs of right now, Roland's is definitely on the right track to be something great.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland's Market\n\nMy parents knew the original owners when this was a market / small family business.\n\nThe hype of the combination of Pizzeria Bianco and Tacos Chiwa has set high expectations. I would say the restaurant satisfied the majority of them.\n\nThe bread and quesidilla definitely had the influence of Pizzeria Bianco while most of the other dishes have a mexican flare of Tacos Chiwa.\n\nWe dined on a Friday evening with a group of six, the restaurant was busy, strange parking lot where it almost encourages double parking. We found a parking spot on the street just in front of the restaurant.\n\nStarted off with the French Fries, Elote En Vaso and the\nVeggie Quesidilla. The fries were crisp and good, I liked the Elote en Vaso, I am a big fan of mayo with corn, actually grew up with Miracle Whip on corn on the cob so this was a winner. The veggie quesidilla was very good, toppings included mozzarella, jalapenos, mushrooms, white onions and spinach. Was very good, next time would like to try the chorizo quesidilla.\n\nOrdered the Chili Colorado Burrito, was told it was on the spicy side, but just enough spice and definitely not to hot. Came sliced in two with a noodle soup with it. Combination of niman pork, colorado chili and refried beans. The flour tortilla was amazingly cooked crisp and all the combination was very good.\n\nSteak Sandwich was in a bread from pizzeria bianco, very good baugette. Included niman ranch steak, guacamole, lettuce, beans and salsa de arbol. Yum\n\nTres Leches is a milk cake with a combination of three milks, condensed milk, whole milk and evaporated milk. It is very creamy light and well done.\n\nMenu is very limited, which is not a bad thing, good suggestions from our waiter. When I go to a restaurant that I have never been before, I look over the menu, kind of decide what I want, but ask the server what their favorite dishes are just to get an idea.\n\nBuilding is an old Asian owned grocery store renovated into a hip open concept restaurant with a bar, show casing the original structure and theme from it's past.\n\nWill definitely come back and maybe try breakfast or lunch.", "useful": 3.4395604395604398, "cool": 2.1538461538461537, "funny": 1.6043956043956045, "date": "2018-10-13 18:10:02"}, "14": {"business_id": "-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA", "business_name": "The House Brasserie", "address": "6936 E Main St", "attributes": "{'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': \"u'average'\", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'Caters': 'True', 'Smoking': \"u'outdoor'\", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'Alcohol': \"u'full_bar'\", 'GoodForMeal': \"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}\", 'Ambience': \"{'romantic': True, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}\", 'RestaurantsAttire': \"u'dressy'\", 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'WiFi': \"u'free'\", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'False', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\"}", "categories": "None", "city": "Scottsdale", "hours": "{'Tuesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-22:0', 'Friday': '17:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '17:0-22:0'}", "postal_code": "85251", "review_count": 388, "stars": 4.0, "state": "AZ", "review": "After being a HUGE fan of the Mission I decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though I was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great. To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery good food. Limited selection for both food and drinks. A little towards the expensive end of things.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meatballs tasted like rubber, the steak tartare was warm, the rice tasted like a deep fryer hadn't been cleaned in 7 years. The only good thing we're the French fries.... but who can mess up french fries?\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh five Matt Carter - LOVE The House! Everything we ordered was fantastic, our service was great, and the ambiance was just perfect. Will be our new favorite place to sit outside on the patio at all winter long!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food, and perfectly portioned. Good atmosphere (especially out front), good music, good people. It is a bit of a mix of modern and traditional, hard to explain, but my parents and I really liked it. The service was a little too slow at times, but everything else was great.\n\n\n\n\n\nFair...nothing special at this restaurant. Wine by the glass is expensive with a limited selection.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of those restaurants that makes you love food and drink!  Garret and Nicholas, behind the bar, are knowledgeable and creative mixologists and our waitress was top of the line.  The food is fantastic; the chef runs an unmatchable kitchen, and the entire experience is fun!   An added bonus is the history and story behind the pine tree!   Visit soon and often.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally able to try the House restaurant.  It has a very sophisticated atmosphere where you can enjoy a relaxing night out with your guest or friends. You are not rushed through dinner and have adequate time between courses.  The service and knowledge of the waitstaff was excellent.   \n\nThe restaurant is a a bit pricey so it is definitely a special occasion time of place.  For starters we had the shrimp with roast corn and Arizona ricotta toast, Creekstone filet and Halibut as the entrees and for dessert we tried the caramel apple cake and goat cheese cake.  Everything was cooked perfectly with wonderful combination of flavors in all dishes. A great dining experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead their reviews and looked up their website.  4 of us showed up today for brunch to a COMPLETELY empty restaurant.  We asked for the table in front next to the window.  Next thing we knew the rude hostess was ushering us to outside seating.  NOTE: it is cloudy and raining today.  The group consisted of 4 / 3 women in their 50's and 60's.  No one was interested in sitting outside on a day like this.  We again asked for the table inside the empty restaurant and she then told us that they were completely booked.  IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY.  I am assuming it was booked for a party or something, but shouldn't you post that on your Facebook page or on your website?  It was handled poorly by their staff and especially the hostess.  WOULD NOT EVEN CONSIDER RETURNING.  Guess what folks... great restaurants are a dime a dozen here in the Valley.  We walked without even looking back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbiance/Decor = 5 Stars. Service = 5 Stars. Food = 5 Stars. Doesn't get any better than this. I've now been there for lunch, late night apps/cocktails and most recently brunch! All were wonderful but must say brunch was the best. I can not thinking about the scrambled eggs. Seriously the best scrambled eggs on the planet. Not sure how they do it but they are so fluffy, creamy and over the top scrumptious. Can't wait to go back again!\n\nInsider Secret: The massive pine tree in the backyard was the Christmas tree of the first family to live in the house. They planted it after enjoying it for the holidays in 1939.\n\n\n\n\n\nWonderful place to eat. We had the best server I've ever had in my life and the foot and atmosphere were both awesome. I will def be back and this is my new favorite spot in Scottsdale.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to come back for dinner a year after a food tour took us here. Everything was fabulous. We split the Brussel sprout salad and it was so simple and tasty. I had the duck bolognese and it was divine. The red sauce was well balanced by the green chive butter. So happy with my choice and the service was so friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad dinner here last Saturday. Best date of my life... From my date ( of course) to the amazing service and then... Oh yeah... The delicious food! You know you're in a neat place when there is a leg lamp on your table. Service ... Don't even want to call it that... Our newest buddy for the evening and is co hort room mate were so funny And had us in hysterics all night. The ambience ... So very nice. Hint... I just bought Ikea out of tea lights and votives so I can recreate their ambiance in my home. The food, you ask? Oh my! I had crispy short ribs with fried crab rice. My amazing date had beer marinated chicken and side of mushrooms . All insane ! Mushrooms were to die for! I'm a mushroom foodie . Try this place out. You will have a new favorite dining spot !\n\n\n\n\n\nI wish I could give this place 3.5 stars.  My wife and I came here for a date night, and was very happy with the ambiance of the place.  This has been ranked as one of the top 10 most romantic restaurants in Scottsdale, and I believe that this is accurate.  Food wise, I was pleased.  The foie gras seemed like a good option, and the chicken meatballs seemed like it would be tasty as well.  We ordered cocktails and they were inventive.  We had the lamb pasta dish and it was yummy and appropriately portioned.  So why the lower score? \nSome logistical hiccups.  First off, we called to make a reservation and were told 845 was the earliest they could do.  Then we book on open table and get a reservation at 815... What?  Also, my goodness was the service slow.  We had planned on ordering appetizers, desert, multiple drinks but couldn't because we could never found our waiter.  The lack of attention really put a damper on the evening though and as enchanting was the atmosphere, the service was the opposite.  There is a chance for a real turn around on this place.  All the ingredients are in place.  It just needs to hire a few more waiters and it could turn into a must go.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could possibly be the worst place I've ever eaten in my life.  I ate here with a group and this is the only time I've actually seen people spit their food in napkins. two of the appetizers tasted like *#*T, now I know why the keep the lighting so low, because if you could actually see the food you would send it back.  The side orders of cauliflower, Brocatini(or whatever it's called) were a pile of mush covered with something. The swordfish I ordered was a dried out small piece of fish. The person next to me ordered the trout and it looked and tasted like salmon fish sticks. The only good thing about my entire meal was the slices of dry bread. One of the other people at our table ordered the steak and that was even bad. No one really said anything during our meal but when we got into our Uber Cab we all opened up and unanimously agreed that this was some really bad food. Our Uber driver said that he's heard horrible things about the place lately and would never recommend it to anyone.\n\nPS. I think I heard the waiter say \"The Chef\" does this, \"the Chef does that\" over 15 times during our meal. The Chef needs to be fired in my opinion. I've had better food at Applebee's.\n\nThe prices are outrageous. \n\nTime to for an episode of Restaurant Impossible to be filmed here.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best new restaurants I've been to in a while. A converted 1940s-ish Scottsdale home, this place has the Best ambiance--especially the outdoor patio. The brisket appetizer is amazing. I had the scallops for the entree and it was fantastic. Can't wait to return!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent restaurant. We ate on the patio. We had the meatball and lobster gnocchi for the table. The meatball was far better. Each of us ordered the Veal pasta. It was excellent. We also ordered an order of roasted cauliflower which was equally good. Will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really enjoyed this place! The menu is great! Very different than any other place I have been. The patio is extraordinary! You have to try the Arizona Arugula Salad.......\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friends and I were visiting in Scottsdale  for a bachelorette party.  (we should have gone to vegas instead lol)  We decided to come here the first night and i have to say i was not impressed.  We were told this was the best restaurant in the city but i surely did not think so and neither did half my freinds.  Our waiter was very nice and the outside seating was nice.  We were able to get a large table under the tent closest to the road so it felt a little more secluded.  I ordered the crab leg appetizer and found that it was very over cooked and rubbery and tasted as if they were cooking it with kerosine.  Then i ordered the halibut and the only thing i really enjoyed becasue my fish was over cooked was the mashed potatoes it sat on.  Their mixed specialty drinks were horrible.  Stick with wine cuz they cant screw that up at least lol.  All in all i would not recommend this place to anyone.  They do not do well with larger partys since half our table got our food and the other half waited 20 minutes before theirs arrived.  So we were sitting there with our food getting cold waiting for the rest of the people to be served.  Also i am not sure what is with Arizona water but UGH gross.  Stick with bottled and sparkling water.  All in all i would say the best part of Scottsdale was the weather and coming home lol.  Very over rated!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my second review for \"the house\", my husband & I were there a few months ago for our anniversary & this time we went  for my birthday, & I must say I still LOVE it!\n\nIt's dark, sexy, & just the right amount of loud! \n\nFun, sexy & romantic all rolled up in one!!   If that was the feel  the owner Brian was going for, we'll the he nailed it! Great job.  \n\nP.S.  the food is outstanding especially the lobster gnocchi . OMG delicious .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House is most definitely a new favorite restaurant in our household... I've eaten there several times already in the few months they've been open, and I plan on being back again soon.  My husband is a regular; he gets out way more than I do!\n\nFood highlights we've had to date include the kale salad, hangar steak, brisket biscuits, chicken parm sandwich, crinkle cut fries, and broccoli carbonarra.  Desserts are pretty delightful as well, and the drink selection won't disappoint either with a ton of California wines to choose from and a unique selection of cocktails too!  Note that the menu does change often, so be open to trying the latest and greatest from Chef Matt Carter; he obviously knows what he's doing!\n\nThe House is extremely charming, with both indoor and outdoor seating in a renovated historic home.  You can tell there was a lot of thought and attention to detail put into this place.  You must take a full tour when you go and make sure to stop in the restrooms; they are pretty swanky.  Take a peak into the kitchen as well - the staff does an incredible job working in such a small space.  \n\nGo with a friend, on a date, or with a large group... Go for lunch, dinner, or drinks.  Just go!  You will thank me later.\n\n***Note that you will probably want to make a reservation ahead of time just in case.  Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here for lunch with my mom who was visiting from out of town. It was quiet and adorable and the food was delicious. Definitely having my boyfriend bring me back here for a romantic dinner sometime soon ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing food...try the goat cheese appetizer, brisket biscuits, and cheesecake for dessert :) \nThe pimm mule cocktail and coffee martini--both were excellent!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place magically combines French charm with comfort. Their dining room is dripping in French dcor, but, the air of casualness is hard to miss. Love that they fuss over the food rather than you. \n\nThe small plates were delectable. The duck confit meat balls (who would have thought, right?) set the bar high, and, everything that followed matched up to it; especially, the luscious crab fondue. \n\nService, while attentive, was non intrusive. No mundane \"how's everything?\" while drifting across the room to the next table. The questions were genuine, and, they patiently heard us out and added to what we had to say without hijacking too much of our time.\n\nThe party poopers were the desserts and the $100 bill for two. I know. I know. Good food is always worth the money, but, I am not sure I will (can?) go back often with the hefty price tag. However, I will go back as often as I can afford to!\n\n\n\n\n\nBest chicken dish I've ever had! The scallion reduction/sauce with some root veggies very well rounded and I had to stop myself from over eating. The chicken meatball appetizer...I could've eaten as an entree...yummy yummy! Our server was great. But...I would have to say...the time between dishes was long. Perhaps it's because we sat on the patio, but we at times felt forgotten. That said, I would definitely go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a vegan and have dined at many fine restaurants in my life. This restaurant was the most unfriendly I have ever experienced. \nWhen I told the server I was vegan she replied that I could have one of the salads without dressing. Or maybe I could have vinegar and oil. \nAs far as a main dish, there were none. None. \nI got overly spiced broccoli and bland mushrooms as my main dish. \nI ordered bread in order to be able to eat something that would satisfy hunger. \nI left hungry and when I got home I ate nuts. \nI have always been offered at least one vegan option at a fine restaurant. \nThis restaurant does not serve sustainable seafood (swordfish??- endangered) and also serves the very politically incorrect and cruel foie gras. \nDo not eat at this restaurant if you are at all conscious about animal cruelty or endangered species.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful venue, great location, awesome staff, and amazing food and drinks! Went on a Thursday night and the place was hopping with energy and fun. Fire apple cocktail with housemade cinnamon whiskey was sinfully delicious, fireball enthusiasts prepare for heaven! Crab fondue and the scallops were absolutely incredible and the boys raved about their ribeye steaks. We were greeted with champagne at the front door and our server paired some amazing wines to go with our dinners. We loved this oldtown gem, we felt literally \" at home\" as we enjoyed cappuccinos and Irish coffees in the outside living room right next to the fireplace. We will be there regularly!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best new restaurants I've been to in a while. A converted 1940s-ish Scottsdale home, this place has the Best ambiance--especially the outdoor patio. The brisket appetizer is amazing. I had the scallops for the entree and it was fantastic. Can't wait to return!\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven of us dined her as part of a bachelorette party. We were greeted with a warm smile and a glass of champagne. We felt as if we were the only ones in the restaurant as each member of the staff had come over to greet us and ensure we were having a good meal. We ordered a few appetizers and then we each got an entire. I had the chicken meatballs and gnocchi and Brussel sprouts. I tell you what...I am a picky eater and it did NOT disappoint! We received 2 desserts to try and they were unique and delicious. After we were finished one of the staff members graciously took our picture outside and the owner and two other staff members came out, talked to us, and gave us recommendations on where to go that night. It was seriously the best dining experience I have ever had. I highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu looks fabulous. Closed early in \"the summer\" at 9 pm. Posted here at 10.  Maybe next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW. This place is FANTASTIC!! Came here for lunch one day before we were leaving to go to Sedona and I'm THRILLED we found it.  We walked in during Sunday brunch time and they were booked but they had seats at the bar.  The bartender was super nice and informative, just what you want to see in a bartender.  I would seriously fly back to Scottsdale just to come here.  5 stars easily! Keep up the amazing work!!\n\n\n\n\n\nA most disappointing evening! We were greeted by our server,he took our order and we never saw him again! The food was unremarkable with one exception,the lamb bolognese which was like paste and tasteless. We spoke to the manager,no apology only an excuse that they were very busy. They take reservations and know their seating capacity so when people show up it shouldn't come as a surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas blown away by everything. The food was was incredible, service was excellent, the decor was very plush, and the atmosphere was energetic. Highly recommend for a date spot. Can not go wrong. Everything on the menu I and my girlfriend tried was really, really good. We eat out a lot where ever my job travels me too and this is a have to if you are in the Phoenix Area.\n\n\n\n\n\nA perfect experience!...\n\nI helped organize a corporate dinner at The House Brasserie last night, and our entire experience could not have been any better! Every attendee--many who were from outside the US--had extremely positive remarks about the evening's experience. In other words: SUCCESS! The ambiance was beautiful, the food was extraordinary, and the service likewise outstanding.\n\nOur group of 40+ was seated in the large, brick-paved patio area out front. The tables were arranged with thoughtful intentionality so as to make our group as comfortable as possible in the beautiful space. The lights, house music, table decor, and gorgeous weather all added to the delightful environment. \n\nWhen our group arrived we were greeted by servers ready with fresh drinks, hot appetizers, and smiling faces. And as the next three courses were delivered one-after-the-other with precision timing throughout the evening (props to the kitchen staff!), our taste buds danced with each exquisite plate as we anxiously awaited the next round of mouth-watering goodness. \n\nAnd as awesome as the ambiance and food were, the overall service completely tied it all together. The management staff were present, hands-on, and willing to bend over backward to ensure everything was perfect for us. The servers were warm and authentically friendly all night long. The bussers were helpful, timely, and unobtrusive. You could tell that the team had been well trained due to the high standard of professionalism from everyone there.  \n\nFrom an event planner's perspective, I can't wait for the next time I will have the privilege to work with the team at The House again. While we were originally planning to hold our event at a different nearby restaurant, I'm so happy we changed our plans to spend the evening at The House. Sonia, Brian, Jimmy, Chef Matt, Sarah, and ALL of the staff were amazing to work with. They were personable and professional. They said YES more than no. They sought to accommodate us in every feasible way. And those things matter to me as a customer. From the first site visit I did with Sonia months before our event, it was clear that she and the team are top-notch professionals who endeavor to deliver the best possible experience for their patrons. Two thumbs, three cheers, and five stars for The House Brasserie!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place! \n\nIt is mainly patio, but it is a beautiful patio! Lots of heaters and a gorgeous fireplace to keep you nice and toasty on these few cold nights we will have. \nAll of the staff seem very friendly, starting with the ladies at the front. Pleasant smiles, and offered champagne right away! I felt like I was walking into a very welcoming home of one of my families. Most people would expect an Old Town Scottsdale \"fine dining\" place to be stuffy, but this is far from! Extremely comfortable. \n\nWe sat at the bar with Kevin. We found out later that he is the bar manager there. What a friendly, funny, and knowledgeable guy! We asked for recommendations from scotch to wine and he nailed it every time! Not to mention the things he has created: house made root beer, that he apparently created with a fellow bartender at his own home. He reduces all sorts of amazing spices (star anise, sassafras, and many many more) with a special type of sugar to make a syrup. He then simply adds soda water. AMAZING! Oh, any Fireball lovers out there? Its the new hot thing right? You HAVE to try his house made cinnamon whiskey. Holy crap. He also told us the story about the history of The House. Ask your server when you go in! It is a neat highlight. \n\nEvery ounce of food that we had was spectacular. I didn't expect anything less with Chef Carter creating the menu. I'm sure he has some amazing talents back there helping him out as well. We started with the Brisket biscuit . Probably my favorite out of the entire meal. We then had the Bolognese, this absolutely blew my mind. We had a caramel apple up-side-down cake with pistachio ice cream to finish. Outstanding! \n\nAll in all, great experience and we will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful atmosphere on the patio! Great selection of  small bites for sharing! My friends and I shared about 8 and they were all tasty!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Good I Forgot to Chew!\n\nBeing new residents of Old Town Scottsdale, it took my wife and me too long to get to House Brasserie. We sat on their shady, quiet patio on a perfect day for what turned out to be a perfect lunch--better than any lunch we can remember. \n\nMy wife had a moaning-good chickpea salad that was beautifully presented. I had the lamb cavatelli with green olives and San Marzano tomatoes. We judged both meals to be practically perfect. The chef, to show the kinds of foods he serves his guests at home, created every item on the menu. (How could we get an invitation there?)   \n\nThen for dessert we shared the chocolate cake, unlike any chocolate cake we have seen or tasted. As we were eating dessert, my wife said she had just picked the place she wants to go for dinner on her next birthday! So that's a date! \n\nWe failed to get the name of our waitress/hostess, but the management of House Brasserie should know because we learned she is from Pinetop, Arizona, of Italian and Spanish heritage. She was just superb--welcoming, friendly, informative, and with a delightful sense of humor. \n\nThe House Brasserie is an easy walk from anywhere within Old Town Scottsdale. Take a hot tip from us: Go there as soon as you can. It's among the finest places to eat that we have found in a very long time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a disclaimer, I've had the privilege of meeting many of the people that work here at one of the nearby bars I frequented while I worked on a project in Phoenix.\n\nThis place has an awesome front patio, and it's off-the-beaten path so you don't get the street traffic that plagues a lot of other outdoor patios.\n\nOn my most recent visit (only my 4th overall), I was here for a roll-off dinner with friends and co-workers as my almost three year stint in Phoenix was coming to a close. We were seated on the outside patio in the corner. The staff promptly came out and greeted us and made sure we were taken care of.\n\nFor our group of nine, they put together a great sample platter of appetizers and charcuterie. For dinner I opted for the Lamb Ragout. And for dessert, they again put together an amazing dessert sampler for us.\n\nNeedless to say, I am loving this area in Old Town. The food from House and other restaurants in this area are eons better than the other areas in Old Town, namely north and east Old Town. Great food and atmosphere.\n\nAll-in-all, this was a wonderful experience with great friends and co-workers, great food, and an awesome staff. Thanks to Tom, Tommy, Rene, Debbie, Heather, Watson, and others for making my farewell dinner such a memorable one! I cannot wait to return.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my favorite restaurant... Amazing food, awesome wine selection, classy setting. Great spot for a date night!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally enjoyed this place. It reminded me of the old scottsdale I was very fond of. Food was excellent, but more importantly, the environment was warm and romantic. We met a few friends here and had an excellent evening. Highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was excellent and service was perfect. Started out with the chicken thighs with crispy skin, just that dish would have been great for dinner. Pork chop was amazing, next time I am not sharing. Mac and cheese was superb, can't wait for more. Finally, the deserts were phenomenal, I wish all donuts and vanilla cake were that good. Luckily for me the wife was willing to share her desert. I will be back, and looking forward too brunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I can say is... AMAZING!  \n\nSuch a quaint little cottage with adorable outside patio and brick fireplace on cold nights.  \n\nThe food is exceptionally \"foodie\" and delicious.  I had the Berkshire Pork Rib with Popcorn Grits and my friends had the Bolognese with Marscapone.  I could not stop eating!  Just pure food fantasy.  \n\nAs appetizers we had Pork Belly with Noodles and an Egg over the top - sinful.  Really.\n\nWe sat at the bar with Keith - who was so friendly and knowledgeable - he really made our experience fantastic!  Oh, be sure to ask for a cinnamon whiskey shot - a magical brew from the bar gnomes.  Thank you magical bar gnomes!  \n\nAnd Thank You to The House for being everything you are.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing out with work colleagues can often be an arduous task and feel as if you are merely extending a meeting beyond the borders of a traditional conference room but this 'work' dinner was not like that at all! The wait staff at The House were amazing. The ambience was perfect, quiet enough to hear each other talk but busy enough to feel the contagious energy of the other diners. Each course was impeccably presented. The description of the dishes by the wait staff was mouth-watering. The wine list was generous and even premium/ reserve wines are available by the glass. The foie gras was like butter. The rib-eye was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  While this was a splendid place for a work dinner, this location would very appropriate for special romantic occasion. The history of The House was shared and the chef deserves accolades for the meal we were served tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice part of history...The drink menu is crafted by local bartender Billy Bessinger...try the specials...love the local feel...it's literally a house but dressed up and a great place to hang out.   You must stop by!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was my second time there for a drink.  Haven't eaten there yet. The place is an old residence, hence the name \"The House.\" It is very cozy and homy and has a very inviting bar.  The bartenders have been very friendly and service minded.  My fiance  asked for a shot of Tequila and one of the bartenders (female, who also turned out to be the manager) recommended a brand she swore by.  Little did we know that a shot was $15.00, however after we complained she comped the shot and apologized for the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is beyond amazing!!! Not only is the food exceptional but their customer service is by far the best. Every single employee is so kind, they all truly make you feel welcome and at home. To top off the experience the atmosphere is serene.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery cute little house, but the food is overpriced & not worth the hype. I had the shrimp and corn. My shrimp was tough & rubbery. I've eaten better cooked  (& cheaper) seafood at Red Lobster. Very disappointing!\n\n\n\n\n\nI popped in previously to book a group for a work meeting, but had never eaten there. Even though my managers decided to eat elsewhere, the customer service left a positive impression. The hostess greeted me by opening the door and a manger walked me through his favorite menu items. \n\nI returned tonight to have appetizers and drinks with my dad and loved it. We sat inside at the bar, which was crowded, but Heather, our server, and Ryan, the manager, took great care of us. They knew the menu well, could explain the wines in depth, and treated us to some yummy desserts! The shrimp appetizer plate, date and espresso cookies, goat cheese cake, and glorified s'mores were all amazing. Definitely coming back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House Brasserie is a cozy restaurant with delicious food & great service.  Our party enjoyed a lamb & pasta dish,  chicken, salmon,  lobster gnocchi,  salad,  & a charcuterrie and cheese plate that were all fantastic. \nOur waitress Emily was very helpful. \nThe kids enjoyed a special drink of the evening,  a lightly fizzy strawberry lemonade.  We were celebrating our son's birthday & they brought him an off- menu panacotta with raspberry & oranges for dessert. \nDefinitely a great date night locale with the combination of great ambiance,  service,  & food!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was really excited to try another of Matt Carter's restaurants because I am a big fan of The Mission and Zinc Bistro. Hopefully the night I visited was an \"off\" visit or this venture will fall VERY short of the other well established restaurants in this group!\n\nThe ambiance is very warm and welcoming, they do have that going for them. The waitress that we had was very disappointing though. Our party had a 9:15PM reservation on a Tuesday night and it was clear she wanted to leave from the moment we arrived. Throughout our meal, we felt so rushed and she was not shy about speeding the service up. They served our entrees to us 5 minutes after we started our appetizer course so we had a million plates on the table, and she asked more than once if we wanted our items wrapped to-go while we were clearly still eating. It was very irritating. She did not ask once throughout the meal how the food tasted. I can easily look past spotty service if the food makes up for it but this was not the case. \n\nNow for the food: on a side note, we were dining with a vegetarian friend (not a strict one, she eats fish and seafood as well). While I am anything but vegetarian, a well-equipped menu should ALWAYS have a few vegetarian options on hand. Her only option on the menu was a kale salad, which she said was very tasty but based on the limited nature of the menu, I would not recommend this restaurant for vegetarians. Seafood options had bacon and ham incorporated in to the dishes. We ordered two appetizers, the ham hock poutine and warm shrimp. The poutine was the only item we ordered of the night that I honestly enjoyed but the shrimp were bland (even though harissa was supposed to be in the dish!) and the very small type, though that was not specified on the menu. For entrees, we ordered the seared diver scallops, lamb ragout, and we were sent out a compted Pork Country Rib because we were dining with a former employee of a sister restaurant. The best dish was the pork one that we didn't even order, I have no complaints about that one, it was actually quite good. I found the lamb ragout to be lacking in flavor and the scallops were not seared, they were closer to steamed. Our side of crab fried rice was so salty that we couldn't eat more than one bite. After the average food, I was reluctant to order desert. \n\nIt is possible we visited on an off night and it is also possible we ordered all the wrong things but based on our experience, I will be sticking with The Mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here, homemade cinnamon bourbon was delicious. Thanks Billy! Decor is gorgeous , would definitely return!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely quaint, charming restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale with an amazing dog friendly patio!  We stopped in for brunch today and fell in love with this place all over again.  Beautiful decor, great service and outstanding food.  I highly recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes...I am going to crave these over and over again - an absolute must try!\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here with my girlfriend for Valentines Day and it was amazing. The staff was very friendly and the service was very good. \nWe sat outside and it was nicely decorated and had a very romantic feel to the place. \nI would recommend it for sure. The food was also good altho not very big portions for the cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyed a wonderful anniversary dinner last night on the patio. I think the thing I was most impressed with is the fact that there were several LARGE parties--like 10-15 tops--and the restaurant handled it with ease! The kitchen wasn't ridiculously backed up. The servers weren't harried and terse with other guests. In fact, 2 of those large parties were prom kids and I was very impressed with how the staff handled it all. Certain Italian restaurants in downtown Phoenix **cough cough**CIBO **cough cough** should come take note on how to handle large crowds while still treating all guests like they are important. \n\nThe food was spot on. We started with the smoked burratta for an appetizer. Creamy, silky, heavenly cheese topped with smoked leeks and truffle oil...what's not to love? I had the kale salad and husband had the Italian farro salad. Both were delicious, not overly dressed, and chilled. Love that. For entrees, I enjoyed the Jidori Chicken which was PERFECT. It was not overcooked or overseasoned and I love the frenched bone in. Wonderful. My husband had the Creekstone filet. He likes his steak well done and House Brasserie did not disappoint. For dessert, we shared the apple upside down cake. The pistachio ice cream really made the dish...the cake itself was just kind of meh....the ice cream definitely saved it. \n\nThe patio is BEAUTIFUL with lots of space and I highly recommend requesting outdoor seating if possible. \n\nWhile this is a \"special occasion\" priced place, we will definitely keep this one in our repertoire of places to visit again SOON!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband surprised me for my Birthday and took me here. We sat at a special table right in front of the fireplace, It was very romantic! The service was impeccable, we were treated very well. Not only was our waitress amazing, so was the rest of the staff. \n\nThe Food was even more amazing. I had the scallops with grits, and my husband had the 20oz Ribeye with horseradish mash potatoes. For our sides we had the fried rice, cauliflower, and the macaroni and cheese (each had a delicious unique flavor). For dessert we shared the donuts, they had a perfect crispy outside with a delicious fluffy inside. The sauces that accompanied the donuts were a perfect match. I highly suggest this restaurant for a date night or a night out with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEVER AGAIN!!!  I don't know where to start with this.  7 months ago I went here for my 3rd visit (I was talked into it) and after that visit, I vowed never to return.  But, I was talked into going again with a group of 6 of us on New Years eve for an early 6:30pm dinner.  We had requested an outside, round table, so everyone could chat with each other.  They didn't even consider our reservation request, instead they seated us in the back corner, by an open door that was used by waiters to come in and out in order for them to get food out.  I sat right under a large music speaker, and asked our very curt and rude waitress if she could turn the music down just a little, as I was having trouble hearing the people at the end of the table.  I was shocked when she very rudely came back at me with, \"the volume on the speakers are set at what the owner believes is the correct level\".  I was shocked, and then pissed off.  When one of our guests asked if they had just a plain mixed green salad he could order (he has dietary restrictions), this patronizing witch of a waitress leaned over to this elderly man, ran her hand down the salad side of the menu, and said, \"this is the menu, and this is all we are serving\".  I was astonished at her arrogance.  This was just a question from a patron and she was talking down to him?  Anyway, this place is just too rude, the food is average to below average, you are packed in too tight at your tables, it is very, very loud, prices high (our dinner was $90 per person including tip, which they automatically included because of 6 people.  That really pissed me off, I would not have given this very rude waiter ANYTHING as a way of telling her to get off her high horse).  The place is just not worth it, you will not enjoy it, and the frustration level will rise.\nWhen I went out to get my car (mandatory valet parking at $5), two ladies were waiting and asked me how I liked my dinner.  I told them about the experience and they said THEY FELT THEY HAD HAD THE SAME EXACT EXPERIENCE!!  They told me they were from NY City, were used to good food and rude waiters, but this place gave them below average food, and VERY rude waiters.  They said they wished they had never eaten there, and that there NY's eve dinner had been ruined because they could not go anywhere else and get a reservation.  Anyway, please be forewarned, this is what you will get if you go here-I have gotten the same treatment and average food 3 times and that is no charm, it has been completely crossed off the list.  Try Virtu or Atlas Bistro is you want boutique type restaurants in Scottsdale\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the house with some good friends and enjoyed the the patio seating.\n\nTried 6 appetizers and 4 entrees like we were cool, took food home as the was only 4 of us.\n\nThe duck buns, the fried rice were really good.\n\nThe owner was very cool knew our friends bought us a round on much not needed tequila as we we're already tipsy, but nice night cap...I think...don't really remember much. After that.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntriguing flavorful combinations and an intimate atmosphere make for a fantastic dining experience\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery part of The House Brasserie is exceptional!  The food, drinks, service and atmosphere are truly a cut above the rest!  Whether you are going for date night, drinks with the girls or needing to impress someone in your professional life this is the place!  I highly recommend the crab and Gouda fondue to start!  For dinner you must try the Lamb Bolognese (order the bread and butter though to soak up the extra sauce) and don't pass up a side of lobster fried rice for the table to share!  My friend ordered the country rib dish and again just delicious!  When it's time for dessert you can't go wrong with any of them but I must say the caramel apple upside cake is was SO yummy!  I will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\namazing food, cocktails & service - a great date spot, we really enjoyed our time on the patio\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House is Old Town's best hidden gem. It hosts the most warm and inviting atmosphere in town. Upon entry everyone is warmly greeted with a friendly smile, as if being invited over to a friend or family member's home. Soft and romantic lighting fill the inside and bar with a cozy glow as the candles flicker playfully in numerous mirrors decorating the walls. inside seating is very intimate and perfect for date nights. The outdoor patio is beautifully lit by tiny lights high in the surrounding trees and shrubbery giving it a very whimsical feel. The patio is an ideal setting for any size group but it's picturesque for a girl's night outing. \n\nGet ready to be whisked away as you dine on a very worldly menu. Chef Carter has masterfully incorporated a little piece of each of his other restaurants into the menu at The House, but still remains uniquely original. Everything is sinfully delicious and it makes you want to try a little bit of everything. Start out with some shared plates like the smoked Burrata, and the Brisket in a biscuit. Grilled crab legs come out with the perfect texture with a tiny hint of smoke from the grill. Indulge with the Lamb Bolognese or the Creekstone Filet. Your tummy will thank you. \n\nThe House also has an excellent cocktail menu to perfectly pair unique, spirits with homemade syrups to provide delicious accompaniments to any entree.  The staff is very knowledgable and take great pride in providing their guests with a unforgettable dining experience. So whether you are on a hot date with your hubby or just want a playful night out with the girls, The House is the perfect spot to meet all your dining and drinking needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nI took my wife here for Valentine's Day as it was listed somewhere as being one of the most romantic restaurants in Scottsdale (I think all the Phoenix romantic restaurants were already booked).  So my impressions of its looks: indoors, the flocked wallpaper, crystal chandliers, many ornate mirrors, all lend a quaint, old time charm.  (Our waitress was sure to tell us that it is the second oldest house in Scottsdale, although it has been renovated).  But the ceilings are exposed with metal struts, and the music goes along with it to lend an urban vibe.  To me, it was inconsistent, trying to please everyone but a bit bizarre.  So, okay, I didn't stare at the ceiling.\n\nOur waitress was great.  She was dressed in classy black, not the usual waitress garb, and definitely seemed to know about the different wines and the dishes that were available.  That spoke to some good experience at this place, which seems rare to find these days.  \n\nThe menu had plenty of choices, and let me say this right now, you really need to pick multiple courses in order to not leave hungry, as the portions are small.  This is one of those special occassion places where you get looks over portion sizes.  Where the price of the course is inversely related to the amount you get.  \n\nWe started with a complimentary amuse bouche, with some cheese baked into a pastry coating I think.  I considered getting the caviar special, but when I later found out the price ($80 for an ounce), I decided on something else.  I got a \"smoked burrata\", which was supposed to be a mozzarrella cheese on the outside, riccotta on the inside, and some other stuff served with toast points.  What I got was a mound of white cheesy stuff which had no discernable flavor at all.  It came with pomegranate seeds, caramelized pearl onions, and non-descript white french bread smeared with some kind of fruity thing.  Not toasted.  This dish was a flop, in my opinion.  My wife got the foie gras.  She had to ask twice to get the advertised toast to put it on.  Finally she got some hearty, raisin-filled toast with which to put the foie on.  I tasted the toast and it was good.  If they had used that toast on my dish, it would have been passable.  I'm not a fan of foie based on the animal cruelty issues brought up, but the wifey wanted it.\n\nWe shared the lobster bisque.  Again, a small bowl, where it comes with lobster pieces and some chopped veggies in the bowl, and they pour in the soup.  And unlike many bisques, this was fairly liquidy, not rich and creamy, so no waistline worries there. It was quite tasty.\n\nA nice feature is that all of their wines are available by the glass, so no need to pony up for a whole bottle because you want to try something only available that way.\n\nFor the main course I got the snapper.  A nice piece, very well cooked.  It came with a mild red sauce, a couple of tiny potatoes cut in half and chopped haricot verts.  I ordered a side of roasted cauliflower for the table which was very good, coming with browned butter, parmesan, and other flavors.  The wifey order the special, a strip steak which came with a dollop of mashed potatoes.  But there was enough steak left over to take home.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a variation of their special, which was a chocolate cake with Kahlua, peppermint cotton candy on top, with a chocolate espresso sauce surrounding it.  We got some honey lavendar ice cream on the side, which was delicious.\n\nOur waitress check on us just the right amount; our water was frequently refilled, and food was brought out and plates removed with excellent timing. \n\nWith the exception of the appetizer mentioned, I'd say all the food was delicious and well-prepared and presented, with excellent service.  I do think it is a bit pricey for what you get, so even factoring everything in, I'd say the value isn't the best.  If you're in the mood to splurge and you're looking to eat in Old Town Scottsdale, then consider this place to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband & I went Saturday night to \"the house brasserie\" for our 31st wedding anniversary & we absolutely loved it!  We had a table under the stars at the fireplace. It was very romantic & the music had a sexy vibe! Our server/manager  (Tim) was truly outstanding!  The food was beautifully presented & delicious!  The decor inside is very glamorous & cozy.  We had been there for lunch & enjoyed it , but had never gone there for a \"special occasion\" before.  We will return!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to The House on January 2nd with my girlfriend . We shared the Kale salad which is a must have! She had the scallops and I had the filet both wonderful.  We both ha a couple cocktails off of their specialty menu, our server insisted we try the pimms mule. We tried the mule, and the green lantern. We both went with a second round, highly recommend the drinks. The service and ambiance were excellent ! The owner even came by the table an introduced himself, he also bought us a round of the house made cinnamon everyone else seems to be writing about, it was awesome!  We will be back soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nI do not generally yelp because I feel that you should always experience it for yourself instead of read about it. However, this is an exception to the rule because this place is just that great!! \nYes they are associated with The Mission and Zinc Bistro and those places are great but the house is different. This place could be anywhere L.A., New York, London, San Francisco, and you'de still feel at home. The ambience is romantic, cozy, and chic yet not overdone. The food is amazing! The steak tartare  with house cut fries that dish alone is worth going for but then there's the beef tongue wrapped in a house made scallion crepe... if it hadn't said tongue on the menu I would have never know, it's that delicious! Matt Carter takes risks with food but in a non-confrontational way, which is so refreshing!\nThe guys at the bar...these guys are mixologists! The house \"remedies\" are top notch. I am usually not a huge fan of gin but the Green lantern is my new favorite drink in Scottsdale! Gin and chartruese with a touch of serrano chile... sounds crazy, tastes crazy good! \nThis place is small and for being so new it is busy!! You may not be able to sit right away but there is always a cute hostess at the front with a smile and a glass of champagne while you wait. \nOnce seated we were greeted almost immediately by our server who was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She offered some great suggestions, beef tongue being one of them, and though reluctant at first to try it, we loved it!! We also had the scallops and bone in ribeye which were amazing! At the end she also suggested the house made cinnamon whiskey which was ridiculously good, fireball's got nothin' on this stuff!\nWe will definetely be returning to this unique little spot! Loved it!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a dream come true in your mouth....my husband and I went here for our first dinner out after our wedding...it was amazingly perfect.  We ordered the bacon streak appetizer to start.  Wow...I've never seen bacon cut that thick, it was perfectly juicy and had fabulous little flavor sauces around the plate.\nNext we had fois gras...never have I had fois melt in my mouth like this.  Never.  It was explained to us that this dish is prepared differently every time, depending on the ingredients the chef had and creative mood he was in...he had to have outdone himself that evening!!!  Muah, the best!  \nWhen our server found out we had just gotten married, she brought us a glass of French champagne on the house...later, we were given another glass of French wine...I can't remember the name, but the host gave a great long description of how long it takes to harvest and how very particular the wine it, I truly enjoyed it!\nOur premier meal was filet-thick cut, incredibly juicy, just perfection...it's not the cheapest place, but we will be back in a heartbeat...or after our next paycheck.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to this restaurant last night as part of the BF and I's V day date exchange. This restaurant had some extreme highs and some middling points. \n\nThe highs:\n\n-House made cinnamon whiskey and the whiskey apple.....I don't even like whiskey and I love this!\n-Our waiter, Tommy, was awesome, helpful, and honest\n-Brisket biscuit..... tiny, but packed a lot of flavor, the meat was tender and the sauce was tangy...just delicious.\n-Broccoli carbonara....not healthy in the least.... so delicious, creamy and cheesy sauce over perfectly cooked broccoli. \n-Apple caramel upside down cake - this cake is phenomenal.... the perfect amount of sweetness and the pairing of the pistachio ice cream is just wonderful. \n-Popcorn grits....extremely tasty, Definitely will get this as a side next time (got it with the pork this time). \n\n\nThe Middling points: \n\n-We were seated right next to the door to the restaurant on the patio, which was ok....but it was a very high traffic area next to the waiting area/lounge thing and it was cold out and this particular table was not near a heater or a fire....not awesome. (and yes, we made reservations a week ahead of time)\n- The pork entree was pretty mediocre....pork should be extremely delicious, but this pork was just lacking flavor. The portion size was big, but that doesn't matter if it's not something you really would like to eat. \n-The goodnight kiss drink was just alright....it had chantilly cream in it, which sounded amazing, but in reality made the drink just a bit too thick and heavy to be very enjoyable. \n\n\nOverall, the night was nice, the food was good, and I would definitely return, but next time I might stick with sides, apps, drinks, and desserts (with an emphasis on dessert...yum).\n\n\n\n\n\nService is friendly and laid back. The cocktails are pretty good. The food was just ok. I am not familiar with Matt Carter, but from what I've heard I was expecting a little more. The Smoked Burrata was under salted. The Pork Belly and Udon noodles were confusing, I couldn't tell what that dish was supposed to be. The pork belly was tender and delicious on its own but with the noodles, it was a strange and unapproachable dish with too many conflicting flavors. The Farro salad had a lot of grapefruit flavor. We liked the pistachio ice cream, however the butterscotch pudding tasted like it was made from a box of instant pudding. \n\nIt was strange being able to stare at the busser station the whole time. It was slightly messy and unkempt. \n\nWhen we first sat down the music they had playing was techno. It felt out of place. However by the time we had our dessert there was light jazz playing. \n\nOverall, I wasn't blown away by anything. \n\nI'm excited to see what Chef Carter is capable of in the future. As for now, I'm still a little lost trying to interpret his cuisine at The House.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been to this restaurant perhaps at least 4 times. It is a fabulous venue to take guests for a really nice meal. It's not one of the rowdier places that is located in Old Town. A wonderful wine list, a menu that is different from others. I do wish there were more gluten free options but the menu can be easily adapted. Having said that I have to say that last night meal was a disappointment. I ordered the filet with a corn garnish and French fries. Brussels spout starter. The food was far too salty. In fact it was so salty I could eat the food after only a few bites of each. Since there were four of us the Brussels sprouts were eaten quickly by the rest of the group. They said it was salty too but did not think to send the item back. The corn side that came with my steak also was extremely salty. So much so that I did not eat it  but the fries were good and the steak was fantastic so I did not send back. I did make mention of the saltiness to the server but he only made a soothing clucking sound and that it was it. It was not until later at home and reading other reviews that my thoughts that the food was overly salted confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, we are back in Scottsdale so we had to come back. Was this place a one hit dinner or does it hold up for round two? I am pleased to say it was just as good, if not better! It was perfection. Every bite, every minute of the service, the ambiance, all of it. This is a must eat at place. Tonight I had the chicken meatball and gnocchi with a side of the smoked broccolini with poached egg and smoked salami (holy smokes it was too decadent to be called a vegetable). The dessert was an expresso mouse coffee cake with berry. The cake had the sugar topping (like a creme brle) all around it. Just stop y'all. I can't even. A-mazing! \n#winnerwinnerfrenchdinner\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hearing so many great things I brought an out of town colleague for dinner. Unfortunately our experience was soso. I knew it would not be an inexpensive dinner but I was disappointed to pay 36$ for an entre and not be wowed. My fish was good but not amazing. My friends salmon special was a bit dry. The bright spot was the bread board and the drinks. And of course the patio. The staff was nice but a bit over coached. I like a genuine atmosphere. Maybe we will try some drinks and appetizers next time and skip the entree.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was here for a baby shower so I can't speak for the regular menu, but can for the staff and the food we did have. What a great, cute set up they did for the party. We were on the back/side patio and they provided fresh squeezed OJ and champagne for mimosas. The staff were very attentive - to the point where they even came around and put a napkin down on the ground for the girls who had bigger purses. \n\nFor the food, we started with a grilled cheese - but it was fancy! HUGE slices of truffle with gruyere melted in between thick garlicy slices of bread. Then we had a bruschetta that had pistachio pesto and local creamy ricotta cheese. We were also served two salads: one was a very basic salad with a light vinegarette, dates, fresh horseradish and butternut squash. The other was a kale salad with a creamier dressing and some cheeses mixed in (I am particular about how my kale is prepared so I didn't try this even though I should have!). We also had fillet and shrimp skewers which were good but they were really spicy and I am pretty sure it didn't say that on our menu so it was too spicy for some of the girls. To round it all out, we had crepes for dessert with a mint ricotta filling and fresh berries. The was more savory than sweet but it was still yummy.\n\nWe then had cake and opened presents and it was all around very sweet and well done by the girls who planned it. Judging by the food, you could tell this place was more up scale, but it would be fun to try it on a date night!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely wonderful dinner, great service, good wine list and very nice ambience!  I would highly recommend The House for the excellent main courses and side dishes. I personally wasn't a fan of a couple of appetizers, as I thought they had too many flavors (ahi tuna), but every main course that our group of 14 had were praised by every person. I will definitely go back when I am in Scottsdale and will recommend to all my business partners!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful decorations, cozy mood lighting, and a comfortable layout make this a perfect place for a romantic evening\n\nThe waitstaff are friendly and knowledgeable. The shared plates are a must: amazing brussels sprouts, delectable cheeses, and incredible cauliflower.\n\nThe main plates were delicious as well, although vegetarians will need to look elsewhere since everything has meat or fish. Or perhaps just stick to more delicious shared plates, of which several are vegetarian.\n\nThe drinks were tasty, although all at our table questioned if there was much alcohol in them. They definitely seemed lacking in strength\n\nEntree prices are high but you get great food. Handmade pastas, high quality meats, and wonderful decor.\n\nLooking forward to coming back again sometime when I visit AZ again\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant find made our day.  We just walked in to this appealing looking restaurant and found the best of surprises.  From the beginning, the service couldn't have been better, hostess, waiter, busboys.  Then the food: kale salad, brussels sprout salad, smoked burrata, lamb pasta, and scallops.  The burrata was the only thing that seemed as if something was missing.  Not much smoky flavor, and without that the cheese was just cheese.  But the other dishes were great, especially the scallops, not something I expected to find and enjoy so much in the middle of the desert.  Overall, a great experience, great food and great service.  Would recommend this place to everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to The House Brasserie on a lunch/brunch date with a friend, and I have to say this is an absolutely lovely place, we had a table out on the patio, which is right near the street, but never once did traffic or voices carry over the fence. You truly feel like you are the only ones there, well besides the other guest enjoying their meal as well. It was tranquil. I enjoyed it.\n\nI arrived early due to traffic, so I started off with a glass of Sparkling Ros, I have to say I did get lost in the watching the bubbles float to the top of the glass to realize my friend was 10 minutes late, I was enjoying the peacefulness of the place.\n\nAfter checking out the menu, we started with the Artisan goat milk cheese with spiced fruit jam and olive bread, the goat cheese was great and the crispiness of the bread gave it great texture, but what made it really pop was the spiced fruit jam.\n\nFor the main dish I ordered the Chimichurri Skirt Steak  Fingerling Papas Bravas, Paprika Aioli, Padrn Peperonata, Raison & Marcona Almond, wow sounds like a mouth full right? I wasn't too sure about how the raisons would work with the beef, but they turned out to be perfectly paired with the steak.  I was pleased with this dish, the steak was cooked perfectly and smooth like butter. In fact I'm even craving it while writing the review! Must go back!\n\nFor dessert I had this incredible chocolate mousse with fermented strawberries with homemade vanilla bean ice cream, the mousse was extremely rich the ice cream balanced it out well. I have to say if I could would have licked my bowl clean, this was just a perfectly done dessert! \n\nThe House Brasserie was a great choice and I look forward to many other visits!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decor is shall I say overdone \"eclectic antique,\" but quaint.\" Music was too upbeat for breakfast, but then changed to a nicer soft jazz.. The ladies bathroom didn't have the toilet seat covers replenished.  The place must be esthetically romantic, but a fire hazard with all of the candles at night, but I wont bother to find out and this is why:\nA big dining out day and they failed for brunch. Vday brunch=meh. From overpriced Evian at 7 a bottle to a 12 sangria; reasonable prices for repeated visits would be 5 and 9 respectively. We shared the scrambled eggs which were delicious, but they failed to give us the two small accompanying toasts, and a bit of a simple carb was needed. Same with the salad; no toast or biscuit served and every dish that pased me had one or two. The smattering of pruciouto was expected....eating in Spain definately spoiled us. We also shared the crab loie salad and it had a sprinkling of crab, at 20, this was pretty sad. If they want to emulate Barcelona, (and prices in Barcelona are less, at least were just a few mos ago)  or anywhere in Spain, start with some olives and breadsticks, gratis and add a croquet or 2 with a carb free dish--meal idea 101. And no butter or olive oil needed guys, save your money if you need it more than your reputation. And instead of investing in another restaurant, how about a small olive grove, they grow like weeds out here and you could serve them on the side! I understand that rent and chef wages are high, but restaurants are a competitve market, and the ingredients were not organic --which makes me wish that I could open my own because I could have created all of this in my own kitchen and better, but it's my day off. The water men were very nice, as was our waiter, but no biscuits on menu. I feel bad for those who drank bottomless mimosas with no crackers or breadsticks to soak up the alcohol. I didnt even want to stay for a coffee. We left hungry and had a croissant and espresso at Starbucks afterwards. The saving grace was my handsome, generous and loving husband, who would have taken me anywhere upon my request.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lovely patio, and impeccable service. Food was mostly excellent. Three of us started with two shared plates -- gnocchi and grilled zucchini, both of which were yummy. Two of us had entrees -- I had filet mignon which was excellent, and perfectly cooked. Another member of our party had the lamb bolognese, which sounded really good but she felt it was too heavy on the olives and said she didn't quite enjoy it and wouldn't order it again. We also had the grilled cauliflower and asparagus as sides, both of which were delish. Would get the grilled cauliflower again.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe made a reservation for this place and arrived on time. We were seated at a little table with a nice intimate seating. \nThe service was great. The hostess recommended different options and explained things on the menu, while also answer in our questions. \nWe ordered the chicken, the fillet, a Mac and cheese, and then a brisket and biscuit as the appetizer. The food was very tasteful with its different flavor combinations. We also tried the chocolate butino for dessert. \nThe only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the lighting. I know the presentation was nice, but I couldn't really see it, and couldn't see very well what I was eating. \nOverall this restaurant was a nice place to visit, and I would definitely return.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot too bad!!  Expected better for the price tag.  Disappointed w/  dungeness fried rice.  Too wet!!  Ribeye steak spiced well.  The ambience is great!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am such a fan of this place! Chef Matt Carter has done it again, creating a menu that will delight whomever you bring. \nMy first visit - I came in on a Tuesday and ate at the bar. Kevin took great care of me, recommending a drink called the Bambaataa. It was so tasty! I started with the duck confit & foie meatballs and was very glad that I did. They were a great first course. Next, Kevin recommended the the crab bisque. I can honestly say that it is the best I've ever had. Tons of lump crab meat, squash and maple cream on top. He paired me up nicely with a table white which I can't remember the name of (dammit!). That was more than enough for one night. \nI came back a week later and started with the Sazerac cocktail, then ordered the pastrami brisket. It was so wintery and delicious - a really creative dish - you don't see neeps done properly very often.  A gent next to me at the bar was eating the lobster fried rice & kept making yummy noises. I think I gotta try that one soon...\nReally can't wait til my next visit - the staff is super knowledgeable, treats everyone like you're special, and are happy to chat.\n\n\n\n\n\nI loved this place in a recent visit to Scottsdale. A smooth, sexy vibe with a sleek, well managed environment and menu. I loved the Foie Gras with eel, the scottish salmon, and the Goodnight Kiss after an excellent meal. We tried half a dozen appetizers including duck confit and lobster roll and all were excellent. Party of about 20 but they handled us all very, very well.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want to say again that I had another exquisite visit to The House. I was invited to a bridal shower on December 29th. The patio could not have been more comfortable or inviting. It truly felt like we were at someone's home. I was so AMAZED at how much I enjoyed the food! I was still so stuffed as I tried to taste more of the shared pork dish (only on Sundays) and it's accompaniments. The service was stellar. I would recommend hosting an event here anytime.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes! Such an amazing place in the Old Scottsdale area. Lunch is out of this world and dinner on the patio is so charming.! We will be back\n\n\n\n\n\nI've sat on this review for days thinking of what I wanted to say. And not because I don't have much to share but rather, too much! This restaurant is brand new and unlike most experiences at places that have only been open a day or two, everything was absolutely picture perfect. Even for our large group of about 12 people! Seriously, not a single glitch. \n\nI heard that building this restaurant took two years and it's no surprise they executed everything so well because the details here are so well thought out. From the precious, romantic location, the sturdy, handsome furniture and the spectacular outdoor dining area. Built around (and in) a house, this restaurant has the makings of getting national attention for its beauty and most importantly, the food and drinks.\n\nSitting down at two large tables under romantic canopies adorned with strung up white lights, I knew we were in for a treat. Because we tried a number of items in our group, it's tough to compare or even mention each thing I ate. Some honorable mentions were the peel and eat shrimp with a Oaxacan chili paste, Maine Lobster fried rice, the kale salad with peppercorn dressing, the duck confit banh mi, and the shaved pork belly. Wow!\n\nThis restaurant is absolutely ideal for any occasion where someone would like to impress their guest. Perfect for dates, taking the folks out to dinner, showing off to the boss or just sharing a dinner with a good friend, The House will really wow anyone who is looking for a quiet atmosphere with higher end food. Prices are absolutely worth what you pay and then some. I will never come back to Scottsdale without eating here!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here to celebrate our anniversary.  Generally these occasions are congratulated upon arrival when you request in your reservation.\n\nThe service was extremely slow (aka 1 hour per course). It was so bad we opted to skip dessert.\n\nThe food: this is what you are coming for, right? Well skip the house brasserie if you want good food.  The food was inventive concept with an interesting perspective but did not deliver in overall flavor. It will leave you flat, and not worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was great but.........we felt rushed! Our server Lindsay kept saying no rush, no hurry, however she convinced us to order in advance because the kitchen can get backed so we did and asked her to space it out accordingly however, our salads were at our table within 5 minutes followed immediately by our main dish. Just way too fast to enjoy the beautiful outdoor patio. And the most shocking part was the price of a cup of decaf - $6! We had to ask if this was an error since my husband had a cappuccino for a reasonable $4. Lindsay said No, it is the cost of a cup of coffee. At a fine restaurant......a cup of decaf should not be $6 and refills should always be complimentary as this is what establishes a restaurant as classy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWanted to love it as I love Mission. The ambiance is beautiful & loved that the owner came up to the table to see how we were doing.  The food was good.  They obviously are still working out the kinks, but I have to say that the service needs to be better.  There were four of us at the table & we were doing a sort of tapas evening - ordering several items & sharing so we asked our waiter several times if one order of each appetizer was good for four (duck meatballs, shrimp, brisket biscuits) - since we all wanted to try each one - imagine our dismay when they all came out with three pieces each, so I never got to taste some of them.  We would have ordered more if we had known - the wait staff should be instructed to advise people as to how many pieces come in each dish so the customers can make informed decisions.  Many restaurants I go to back home, in NYC, will advise you as to how many pieces are in a dish & will offer to add to the original amount for a little extra - we have no problem paying for additional pieces so it would be to the restaurant's advantage to just let people know.  We all left there still hungry.  I'd go back & give it another try based on how much I love Mission and how beautiful the place itself is.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ended up at The House Brasserie for my husband's 50th birthday, coming all the way from Seattle to celebrate by staying at The Biltmore and eating at Cafe Monarch... it's a long story, but Cafe Monarch was not at all accommodating even after  making reservations 6 weeks prior, so luckily their chef, Christian, sent us over to House Brasserie. What a gift! House Brasserie has a beautiful setting, top notch service and wonderfully creative and delicious food. Our bill was quite large, but definitely worth it. The wine was special and our particular menu favorites were the ribeye and the fois gras. We had top executives from Microsoft and Expedia and we all agree- we will be back! Thank you to Chef Matt for a very special, memorable evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House Brasserie was amazing. Todd and Tommy were our waiters and they were so nice and very helpful in every way. We were there this past weekend for a bacherlorette weekend and the food was amazing. We ordered sevewral dishes and split everything. A few of our favorites were the brisket and biscuit, the duck meatball, the country pork rib, the halibut, the grits, the broccolli. They even gave us a free bottle of champagne to celebrate the night. The atmosphere was so cute and fun. We would definitely come back again!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food and atmosphere. Everything we ordered was mouthwatering! We loved our two appetizers and the grilled peach salad.  For the main course, I ordered the halibut on top of shitake mushrooms and parmesan potatoes. Perfectly cooked. My hubby ordered the filet, which was a tiny bit overdone. My favorite thing was the side of basil/brie smashed potatoes he ordered. And, you MUST order the butterscotch pudding for dessert!  \n\nThe owner stopped by at least twice to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying the food... that was a nice touch. We were also seated at the table closest to the fire pit... a bonus on the first chilly Valley night. Our waitress was also fabulous and very on the ball. \n\nIf there's room for improvement, it would be with the hostess and the food runners. We waited quite awhile for a table, despite making reservations. (Although, it might've been because they were trying to get us onto the patio. If that's the case, they should just say so... so we're not wondering if we were forgotten about.) Also... the food runners gave us the wrong plates at first. They returned quickly after realizing the mistake... disappeared around the corner for a second, only to come right back out and set the SAME plates at the neighboring table. Those guests didn't notice, but we were a little surprised that would happen.\n\nStill, we'd go back. The restaurant hasn't been open long and I'm guessing the kinks will be ironed out in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery good food and service. Loved this place. You will definitely pay for it though. Very expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing great food. A quaint location that's intimate and cozy. The dishes are a little pricey but, worth the splurge\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing!!! My boyfriend decided to take me here for dinner on New Years Eve. He had been here with his family before but it was my first time. We sat outside under white tents that had heaters, which were actually very warm and nice to sit outside. The patio is so romantic, all tables are candle lit and the fireplace is beautifully decorated too. Our server came to our table with a sparkler and a complimentary bottle of Perrier Jouet...... WHAT I SAID ....never have I heard of such a thing, and I use to be a server back in my younger days:) . The owners had decided to give every table a bottle in celebration of being here and open!!! I still can not get over this I have told everyone how awesome that was. Nice touch!! Food was fantastic as well we shared a warm shrimp dish to start. I had a filet which came out perfect and was served with roasted corn and shishito peppers which are  my new favorite thing. I can't wait to return.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisited The House Brasserie for lunch. What an insanely charming restaurant, both inside and out. It reminded me of many European establishments I frequented while living there.  I ordered an Arizona arugula, crispy shallot, roast strawberry, Mission Figs and radish salad. My guest had the arugula, Italian farro, avocado, Bellwether Farms Crescenza, hazelnuts and salumi salad. The service was friendly, our waitress well educated on the menu. The salads were delicious, perhaps a little smaller than I had expected. Although I was there for a work lunch, this is definitely the place for a romantic date, especially at night. As a vegetarian I was disappointed in the lack of choice; however the menu looks great for people who enjoy not being vegetarian. The parking lot for the restaurant is small with room for perhaps 6 cars; there is however ample complimentary street parking. \n\nThe good: atmosphere, food and service. The bad: limited vegetarian options.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this restaurant! The atmosphere is fantastic, I love the homey feel. The lighting is perfectly romantic with all the candles and string lights. The food is to die for, I loved the Creekstone Filet, it was so tender and delicate. For all my vegetarians out there, they can make the Lamb Bolognese without the lamb. The food was great but so was the service. Lupita made the night great.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scottsdale for business, we wrapped up,our trip at The House.  What a great choice.  We started with foie gras and the cheese apps. My first time with foie gras.  Had to try it, not bad not sure it's for me though.  I had the veal chop.  Other than being slightly overcooked, (asked for med rare, got pretty heavy med). Other than that it was still a pretty darn good veal chop.  Couple others had the scallops which were amazing.  Our other companion had the ribeye, also amazing.  The crab fried rice was fantastic!\n\nI will certainly eat here again when back in town.\n\nWell done!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent with the family (party of 8) for NYE dinner.   For appetizers we had the burrata, crispy chicken thigh, lobster gnocchi and foie gras.  The gnocchi was the standout dish.  Also had the tomato bisque (relatively spicy but we were not warned and one of the people who ordered could not eat it) followed by grouper, tomahawk pork chop, NY steak, scallops and lamb bolognese with roasted cauliflower, dungenes crab fried rice.  Had one of each dessert.  \nOf the dishes I tasted the fried rice was my favorite. Chop was fair but we've had much better.   The other dishes were not bad but nothing stood out.\nThe big disappointment was the service.  Seemed like one of the servers was in training and the timing of various dishes was off (in particular, 1 of the soups we ordered arrived before the appetizers and the other one after).  Many other little faux pas that one would (should) not expect from a restaurant of this claimed caliber.  Our bill was $600 before tip so I expected something a little better than what we received.  \nAm giving 3 stars because the meal wasn't a disaster and I don't know if I can do 2.5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here because they own another restaurant in old town named the Mission,  which is one of the best Mexican restaurant I ever went to, the food here does not even compare, great atmosphere but would never eat here again,\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a nice spot with a wonderful outdoor/patio area.\nWe ate outside and it was a wonderful experience.\nThey have a very nice inside eating area too.\n\nGreat place for a date or special evening out.\n\nOur server was great and most food items were very good.\nTrie 8 different plates among the 3 of us and the only weak plate was the shrimp appetizer. Rarely order a steak, but the ribeye was the highlight of the meal.\n\nIt's a bit expensive, but a very nice restaurant.\nDefinitely need a reservation for the weekends.\nLooking forward to my next visit!\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 to be fair !!!\n\nOkay this place is hands down super trendy and romantic and just adorable inside ( I love all the mirrors). We had two mishaps without food being undercooked...they fixed both without giving us any grief and were very nice about the whole situation. Our service was great overall and they definitely made up for the food situation. \n\nWe tried quite a few things- the kale salad is flippen fantastic. I'm not a huge meat eater so i was happy with the kale salad and brie potatoes we got also. My dear bf is the meat lover out of us and he was disappointed a little with the pork he got but said he would like to go back and try again so it was not alllll the bad.\n\nThe desserts were sinful and delicious and paired well with some shots of peppermint schnapps :)\n\nI want my star rating to go up so we will give it another go around in the near future...there is definite potential to be found at The House Brasserie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our favorite restaurant in town right now!  The food is amazing, atmosphere unique, and the waitstaff is always super attentive, friendly, and knowledgable.  I can say we have experience some delays in getting food out from the kitchen, however the waitstaff has always communicated whatever issues in a timely fashion, and even brought us house-made cinnamon whiskey as a thank you for understanding.  I have had almost every small plate offered and they are all amazing.  Some favorites include the Poutine, Biscuit and Brisket, and the Arizona Ricotta.  We also always get the Popcorn Grits - to DIE for.  The drinks are truly handcrafted concoctions and the wine list is expansive and complete.\n\nThe setup of the restaurant is really wonderful.  There is plenty of inside seating with the focal point being a vintage mirrored bar that just screams \"sit here, order a drink\".  There is also patio seating and some very sexy seating around the fire place.  Additionally they have area for private events.\n\nThe bathrooms are super cute and located in a separate small house on the side of the restaurant.  Quirky and fun.\n\nWe have also had good luck with finding street parking but they offer a valet for $5.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch  a cute quaint little restaurant. I love the history of \"the house\" too. Way more seating and space than I thought there would be. Service was fantastic and food was very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was in town for Spring Training with my boyfriend so we are unfamiliar with the area and going off of pure Yelp reviews without some friend recommendations made us nervous. We finally zoned in on The House Brasserie because of its variety of food beyond just steak like many other nice restaurants in the area.\n\nThe food did not disappoint and prices/portions were totally reasonable. I'm from the SF Bay Area where there is no good shortage of food but I would say THB is on par with all the nice restaurants in SF.\n\nWe started off with cocktails - Green Lantern for me (gin, lime, honey dew, and other flavors) and a Roiboos whiskey drink for the bf. Both were great, I think the green lantern is one of my favorite gin cocktails I've tried thus far. \n\nApps- Thick-cut bacon and Foie Gras. FG was paired as a charcuterie plate with almonds, mustard, pickles, daikon radishes, and some other pairings and seared to perfection and nicely seasoned. Thick-cut bacon was tasty but had the texture of pork belly instead of bacon.\n\nMain Dishes- Ribeye for the bf and Duck Bolognese for me. Both were awesome dishes and we agreed they were 5-star worthy. Neither dish was overcooked or over-seasoned. We also ordered mushrooms and basil+brie fingerling potatoes as sides. \n\nDessert- Because I let them know it was my boyfriend's birthday, they took care of dessert and brought out a deconstructed vanilla bean goat cheese cheesecake with reduced strawberries, coconut crust crumble, mint, honey lavender. I don't usually like cheesecake but I have to say this is the best cheesecake and one of the best desserts I've ever had. They also brought out two glasses of complimentary champagne which was a nice touch.\n\nOverall- Service was above and beyond my expectations and the food was delicious. Total bill was just under $150 before tax, and that's including 2 cocktails and a generous amount of food! There is outdoor and indoor seating available, but choose outdoor seating if you want a quieter romantic setting. They have heat lamps and extra blankets in case it's cold out.\n\nThank you House Brasserie for making my boyfriend's birthday dinner experience and our sole fine-dining experience in Scottsdale a memorable one!\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided on The House for our first wedding anniversary based on a recommendation. Fantastic all around - food was amazing. We started with the Licorice Pork Belly which is the best pork belly I have ever had. For the entree, I chose the scallops and they were really, really good. However, my husband had the ribeye. He let me sample it. It was probably one of the best steaks I have tried and although the scallops were great - I regrettably wished I had got the ribeye. As for drinks, out of this world cocktails. Their Manhattan is my new obsession. The House also let's you have their reserve wines by the glass which is an awesome option. Service was impeccable and personable. \n\nWe've since returned, getting our favorite items (the ribeye all to myself finally!) and each trip is just as fantastic as the first. This is our newest much loved spot!!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery classy!! Loved the food, loved the ambience, loved our blonde-haired waitress... But what the hell was up with the intoxicated hostess? This girl was on one last night! She was WASTED! She was falling all over the place, slurring her words, oh and the poor \"trainee\" she had... She was so apologetic after seating us. This intoxicated hostess couldn't even remember after 5 minutes while waiting for our table what our parties name was and if we wanted to eat inside or outside. Girl, we just spoke to you 5 minutes before, get it together. Poor thing could barely keep her balance. Whatever she was on, it made for a very interesting start to our evening!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat venue- interesting and delightful food, quality wine list and top notch service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale, their gnocchi & chicken meatballs, lobster gnocchi, baked robiola cheese, Cold creekstone steak tartare and smoked burrata are some of the best starters of any place I know. My favorite dish is probably the Atlantic Halibut, but the Creekstone Filet is always a hit, as is the Lamb Bolognese. Too much flavor!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for an overly pretentious  dining experience, then this is the restaurant for you.  Now mind you, the food is ok, but only ok.  Overpriced fare and small portion sizes are their soup du jour.  Decently flavored, but not worth the money or the wait.  Unless you are trying to impress a date by spending a few hundred dollars for a couple rounds of drinks and some mediocre food that comes complete with an absentee server, then you could do much better elsewhere.  The Valley has so many wonderful restaurants that I won't be surprised when this one closes, nor will I be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelightful food in a magical setting.  I suggest going at night when the lights and candles are flickering.  Eat outside.  The food is fantastic.  The only thing we did not like was the shiitake mushrooms.  They were \"too\" smokey.  Worth the money.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it is not destined to be a positive experience and this is a case of big disappointment.\nWhen you order in advance for a group and sample the menu and what you get is totally different from what you expected, there is something really wrong. Not to mention the small portions and the huge quantities of bread to get you full and the total indifference from the staff - I CAN ONLY SAY THIS THIS PLACE SUCKS AND WE WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN....\nIt is a nice venue, but a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\n\n\n\n\nLovely little cottage turned into a restaurant, with a cute outdoor patio cooled by aircon/fan.  We just wanted some quick apps and a glass of wine in the afternoon while shopping so we sat at the bar.  Turns out their primi menu (apps) is very limited unless you are there for dinner.  we had a couple cheese selections and the salami plate with wine.  the one soft cheese with truffle oil and leeks was pretty nasty (smoked burratta).  but the other cheese was really tasty (goats milk with plum jam, and we had plenty of bread. the salumi plate was good, not off the charts.  Overall, I felt it was pretty expensive.  Probably better experience to come for dinner when the full menu is available. Seems like it would be lovely and romantic with the lights on the patio.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, I wanted to love this place.  And it's not that it's bad, but they are missing the mark on the dishes I tried, albeit in easily fixable ways.  My first course was the smoked burrata.  LOVE the idea, not their result.  The burrata was very lightly smoked, as it should be, you don't want to overpower this delicate and luscious cheese.  I get that.  But a little adjustment is needed.  The MJ bread they served it with was white on white, tasteless and textureless.  You could hardly tell if it had seen a broiler or grill, it honestly looked and tasted like long rods of wonder bread, and the very little grilling or toasting the bread received just made it seem stale.   I love starches of all persuasions, beyond reason actually, but I left this bread on the plate after the first bite.  The cheese was simply served with a bit of vinaigrette, a bit of green onion, the bread, and nothing more.  I get keeping it simple and letting the cheese be the star, but it seriously needed something.  Perhaps a drizzle of a lightly smoked tomato coulis, a smear of parsley or basil pesto, or a little gremolata of finely diced preserved lemon with parsley and garlic, something to complete the idea, please!  And consider serving it with medium to large house-made olive oil fried croutons.  That would make a huge difference.\n\nThe duck confit bahn mi also fell below the possibility the dish offers.  There is a restaurant in the Seattle area that serves a version which qualifies for my short list for \"last meal on earth\", so my bar for such a sandwich is admittedly high.  But The House could get there, or close anyway, with just a bit of tweaking.  First off, replace the MJ soft bread with a section of lovely french baguette (does MJ make one?), as should be used on a really good bahn mi.  And consider replacing the cilantro mint pesto with a sauce that would have a more complementary flavor profile, maybe a hoisin aioli, maybe a fruit based slightly smoky, not too assertive BBQ sauce (rhubarb?).  To my mind, it would be greatly improved with a sauce that was slightly sweet, and with just enough of a balancing tang to cut through the rich fat, like one of the choices I mentioned, or a myriad of other options.  I would also add some caramelized shallots or onions to the duck.  And please, get rid of the mushy centered crinkle cut fries.  Seriously?  How about a little arugula salad with fried shallots and oven roasted tomatoes, or small round discs of a waxy potato (yellow finn or red bliss) cooked in duck fat, caramelized around the edges, or something else simple but satisfying.  Just something else, please.  The same frite they serve at Zinc Bistro would be a huge improvement, but just a little fatter would be even better, so you get more potato to balance the richness of the sandwich.\n\nBottom line, I will likely give it another try, see how it goes with different choices.  But my gut reaction is that a visit from a menu consultant with an impeccable palate is needed to turn this into a place I'll regularly want to visit.   \n\nAs an aside, I know I'll probably get slammed for dissing the MJ breads used here.  Yes, his breads are very popular locally.  And he does make some good breads, just not these two maybe.  But why oh why is there no truly great and complete bakery here in the Valley?  Essence in Tempe makes good baguettes, but doesn't sell them, darn, and doesn't make any other breads, only pastry, darn again.  There are a couple of restaurants and markets that make their own very good bread that they sell, or will sell if you ask.  Andreoli's and Christopher's come to mind, but each one only offers one or two types.  There is no single bakery I've yet found that has great baguettes, and loaves or rolls of campagnia, walnut, olive, ciabbata, pugliese, or assorted other rustic style breads.  Give me that, add some great pastries, and I'd be in heaven.  If anyone can steer me toward the great place I'm missing, I would be forever grateful!  Otherwise, guess I have to make my own starters, get a new pizza stone for the oven, and go back to baking my own.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was here for lunch and ordered the burrata because they told me is was buffalo milk. It's not. It's not even burrata. It's regular mozzarella, and they're charging $10 for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper cute atmosphere - large covered patio with heat lamps and great mood lighting.\n\nThe night started out mediocre. We had been sitting at our table for what felt like a long while when some one finally asked if we had been helped. Once they had realized the start to our night was not impressive, they more than made up for it. Our server, Michael, was great and suggested some very yummy options. Before we even got our appetizer he brought out a very light and delicious cheese pastry. We ordered the brisket to start - very good!\n\nThroughout our meal not only was Michael very attentive, but the manager, Watson, had been out a few times to check on us. It always makes you feel good when a manager gives some undivided attention.\n\nDinner was very delicious - I would recommend the filet. It was cooked perfectly - exactly how we had asked. To top off the awesome meal, both Michael and the manager came back out with a little sample of a dessert cookie and an after dinner liquor. We will definitely be back for future vacations - maybe even once more before we leave to head back home.\n\nThank you Michael and Watson for the great service and great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nMother's Day brunch in the patio was excellent.  The buffet choices, entree, and mimosas were delicious.  The service very attentive.  Cool vibes here.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I could, I'd give 4.5 stars.  We celebrated our anniversary here this past weekend.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is extremely charming and in cooler temperatures, the patio is probably a wonderful place to enjoy a meal.  \n\nDo not miss the craft cocktails.  They are interesting, unique, and tasty.  \n\nWe shared the brisket on a biscuit and the crab fondue.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The fondue was tasty as well but it did tasty unfortunately fishy.  \n\nThe filet was perfectly prepared and the brie and basil fingerling potatoes were delicious.  My husband's lamb was enjoyable but he was disappointed to find that the kitchen had substituted peas for fava beans.  He let the waiter know and they were kind enough to buy us dessert.  \n\nOur waiter was charming, friendly and appropriately attentive.  \n\nI will definitely return.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was our first time trying this restaurant and will definitely be our last . I am not sure if we have ever had such mediocre food . The menu looked enticing but the pork was overcooked on some pieces raw on others . Do not get me started on the sides .. Worlds smallest portion of bland tasteless macaroni and a crab fried rice that lacked any crab , flavor or dignity . This meal made me reconsider why I enjoy eating at all . There are many great local restaurants in the same price range with much bigger portions and for the love of god flavor !! I suggest mastros city hall , cafe monarch and cowboy ciao . This is not a house I would ever like to step foot in again .\n\n\n\n\n\nA friend and I dined at \"The House,\" for the first time today.  It was our annual Holiday luncheon and I was disappointed.  I am familiar with the other two restaurants, in the mix (Zinc Bistro and The Mission) and enjoy both, very much.  I was expecting the same caliber of food and service in the newest addition.  That didn't happen.\n\nFirst of all, their on-line menu and \"actual\" menu are different.  The on-line version listed entrees, in the Lunch section.  Not so, in real life - sandwiches and salads are it.  I had already decided on the Hangar Steak, so was disappointed when I had to settle for a turkey sandwich.  Not my idea of a gala lunch.  The sandwich was okay and that's the best you could say for it.\n\nThe service staff actually argued, with me, about the on-line menu listings (which I checked when I got home - yes, entrees are listed, as I write) and so did a manager type, who checked our table, at the very end.  This is just not the caliber of service that I personally know that Brian expects of his staff.\n\nOn the plus side, the Apple Shandy cocktail was delish; ditto the Irish coffee.  So the outing wasn't a complete bust but it came very close and for $90+, for two, for lunch - yeah, I am disappointed and would not go back again.  At least not for lunch.  Because I know of the caliber of the other two restaurants, I'd be willing to give it a go, for dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, to THB's credit I will say that the place was very busy the night I went (3/14/2014) and the ambiance was amazing. I chose this restaurant solely on the great Yelp reviews, so maybe my particular experience was just an unlucky one. That said...I won't be coming back.\n\nThe evening started off kind of shaky. Service was very slow to greet, and we felt like we'd been handed off back and forth between waitstaff from the outset of the meal. Waitress was definitely spread thin, and we felt rushed to put in our full order from the get-go. Personally, I like to eat my appetizers before ordering main dishes, but it seemed like this was not an option. So after waiting about 15 mins after getting our drinks, we were finally able to order. The app was great, we had the Baked St. Andre Cheese. AMAZING but we ran out of bread quickly. We ordered more...but it never came...waited for it but the cheese was getting cold, so we just ate the cheese and cancelled our order. Strike ONE.\n\nWe soon received our main dishes, the filet and the scallop entrees respectively. Scallops were great, 10/10. The steak, which we ordered medium rare, was uncooked...not undercooked, but practically BLUE in the middle. We sent it back immediately and got some cheese puffs, the night's amuse bouche, to hold us over. When we got the steak back after a good amount of time, it still wasn't cooked properly, but we were tired of waiting at this point and just decided to deal with it. STRIKE TWO.\n\nFinally, dessert comes and it is a birthday dessert, which was a deconstructed goat cheese cake. I know this is an experimental restaurant, but this was a failed experiment for sure. However, since it was a free dish, and of course everyone's taste is different, I wasn't too upset. \n\nWhat did bother me, though, was when a waitress grabbed our UNFINISHED bottle of wine off the table before we could get a word in, and immediately threw it in the trash. We were definitely planning on finishing it or at least taking the corked bottle home. STRIKE THREE.\n\nThere was one more thing that bothered me. When I got the check, I saw that we were charged for the cheese puffs sent out by the kitchen when we sent back our undercooked steak. I brought this to the waitress' attention and she quickly removed it, but not before making a remark about how \"the first ones are free but additional ones are extra.\" When I explained that we didn't order them, she rudely interrupted me to remind me that they were indeed removed from the check so it was a non-issue.\n\nPerhaps a one-off bad experience, but in this case; when it rains, it pours.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food and nice service. The patio is great, and there is not much inside dining.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for brunch and had the chimichurri skirt steak and it was really good. Place has a really cool atmosphere on the patio and good service. I had a lot of friends in town from LA and Vegas and they said they enjoyed the place as well, have to trust their opinion when it comes to food.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were a party of five here for Mother's Day dinner, a special occasion. Being avid Yelpers, my daughter chose the House Brasserie after reading the reviews. It has always helped us dining traveling all around the US. It is amazing invention! In a restaurant I look for ambience, food and cocktail/wine selection, and of course, professional  service, especially at these prices. I always think on Mother's Day or other special occasions, the establishment should make an extra effort. This could include fresh flowers on the table or a flower given to the women, and the host at least making a greeting.  A majority the time the women are making the dining decisions, their target market.\nThe setting is a good statement. It included a beautiful patio area with mood lighting, always a plus to dine outside in the spring in Scottsdale.\nThe host who had a warm greeting and a good smile, stated, \"it is a good thing you missed brunch! It was mobbed!\" Thank you for sharing, I do not want to hear this at the start of my dining experience. The host sets the mood. He showed us to a table of our choice outside.  The lighting was lovely and set a warm mood.\nHouse Brasserie, as the name suggests a French style.  The menu, the style and the service were anything but. The music was overly loud and sounded like a disco that I would visit after dinner to dance, not one to eat my leisurely supper to. I asked  them to turn it down as I could not hear the person next to me, and finally after a second request, halfway through the meal,  it was done. Dining is about sharing the experience with your friends at the table. In order to do this, you have to hear what your dining partners are saying.\nThe server was a show in and of himself. He couldn't decide if he was doing stand up at open mike and putting on a show for us, or he was a server. He was so full of himself,  we wondered what he was trying to do. At first comment, he made a personal comment about my appearance, had no knowledge of most of the menu items, and inserted himself into the personal conversation between two of my friends.  When pouring the sparkling water, he chose to serve the solo gentleman in our party first, a big faux pas, by any standard.  In fact he had to bypass the four women to do so and he made a point of going around the table to do so, this is a very uninformed server.\nNot to mention that the service was extremely slow. Once we got our food which took a long time, he was no where to be found.\nThe menu is all over the place.  They have foie gras, nice, this is French. Then they have chicken fried oysters. What is this, is this French? The swordfish at 28.00 is the same price as the beer brined chicken at 28.00. I have no idea why??? The filet mignon is 36.00 which seems OK but does not come with a thing. The 16 oz . rib eye is $50.!! This is excessive, we are not dining at a premiere steak house. The menu is as confused as is the service. But, there are different choices. There is mac and cheese, I guess something for everyone. If you didn't cook up your mac and cheese for your lunch, you get another chance to have it.\nThe cocktails were good and made well with a good selection, and they did not skimp on the alcohol. Two of us ordered the swordfish which had a nice crusty finish but was overly salted, noted by other diners and again there was a lot of empty space on the plate. The chicken was good but again very over priced for chicken, and finally the filet, prepared beautifully and cooked to perfection. But, the filet, again comes with nothing. The water man was excellent . The water glasses were always full and we did not have to hunt for him. The food runner was confused as to who ordered what, the burden should not be on the diner to inform him of who ordered what dish. Once we instructed him of where the orders were to be placed, he did have knowledge of the food. When our meal was almost concluded the server finally showed up to check on us. The restaurant was not crowded. Where was he??\nWe did not order a dessert from the limited dessert menu as the service was tedious. It was time to say good bye to House Brasserie. Maybe lunch will be better when they get a cohesive concept and service staff to assist their overall restaurant goals.\n\nIf you are expecting professional service at these prices, they have not met this goal yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a romantic, cozy neighborhood spot. On a beautiful evening I recommend reserving a seat on the patio. The cocktails are delicious proving the bartenders are well trained and reliable. My reco's include smoked burrata, diver scallops and the house mac & cheese. Cheers!\n\n\n\n\n\nBooked a table here as we had some out-of-towner friends (from Boston and Seattle) visiting for a few days. I had eaten there before and was REALLY impressed with the quality of the food, service and surroundings.\n\nThis place is really great. Its part of the group that also has Mission (Scottsdale and Kierland) and Zinc Bristro, and all of these are superb places to dine. Gorgeous layout and decorations, low mood lighting (almost too low, as I had trouble reading the menu (without my reading glasses!) but its just a small oversight.. (excuse the pun)..\n\nWe all had a variety of meals, but started with the Fois Gras, which was just out of this worldly good!! I posted a pic of the platter when I checked in but will hopefully show it in a group photoshoot of our meals..\n\nWe all selected several different meals so we could try each one (just a little taste anyway!!) - the chicken, lamb, filet.. I think the pictures speak for themselves - these were lovely meals and I would definitely consider another visit back very soon! Great thing is that its just around the corner from home!! Even better! Enjoy/godere/disfrutar/genieen/prendre plaisir\n\n\n\n\n\nTricked again.  (See my review of 1/2014)  I am the fool. But,NEVER, NEVER, NEVER AGAIN!  Several years ago, I reviewed this restaurant on Yelp and stated that I would never return due to the extremely poor service and the attitude of those who work there.  However, I had no choice but to make a reservation here for Valentines Day, since this was literally the only restaurant that had a reservation available before 9pm (in retrospect, it is obvious why they still had reservations available).  What a mistake!  Nothing has changed.  The server was very patronizing, inattentive and arrogant.... and actually tried correcting me 3 TIMES on the pronunciation of the word \"Haut\" on a bottle of wine (I know my French, know my wine, and know my pronunciations-she was wrong.  In case you read this madame, the \"t\" is not pronounced in French when a word ends in \"t\" so you might want to quit trying to put your customers down and embarrassing them). The time it took to get the starters, main course and desserts out was incredible.....and it was not the kitchen's fault, as a table of 4 next to us were seated after us  served before us (by a long shot) and left the establishment before we had dessert. And our waiter never stopped by to give us an update on why it was taking so long.  When I inquired, she said \"Oh, it's a very busy night\".  I get that...which is why they had a price fixed, limited selection menu last night so the kitchen could handle it.  Our waiter never came by and asked if we would like more water, there was not a set up of utensils or napkin on one side of the table (which the waiter should have noticed when she first came by), never stopped by to ask us if we were enjoying the meal and was just generally acting like a stuck up, spoiled brat child-snob.  This place is the absolute worst for service.  The food is very average, nothing special, but not outstanding, so I am okay with that, but  the interior of the place has seen better days, the chairs are wobbly, the wood pretty beat up on the table tops and it is pretty dirty inside.  Restrooms are outside, by a busy serving corner past the kitchen.  Honestly, I am shocked that anyone ever returns to this place, and shame on me for being such a moron for returning. Take a pass on this place, you will be glad you did.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were in Scottsdale for a week in January and looked forward to The House on a Friday night. Enjoyed their sister restaurants so felt confident our meal would be fantastic and had so many great Yelp reviews. \nSo disappointed from start to finish!  Either we ordered the wrong items or the regular chef was on vacation. \nAppetizers:\nWarm Shrimp Salad: corn was great but the shrimp had a gummy texture and inedible. \nSteak Tartar:  taste was fine but did not pair well with chunky French Fries. Waiter said it was American style and only French serve it with bread. \nDuck Confit Meatballs:  dry crumbly texture and  seasoning was way off! Waiter said they were taking this off the menu. \nArugula Salad was fine  \nRoasted Jidori Chicken: dry and the risotto was so heavy, could not eat. \nPork Country Ribs: huge serving but dry\nScallops were the best of the evening. \nWaiter felt so bad, he gave us an order of broccoli. Ended up charging us, but took it off after we noted it. \nAlso had drinks but declined dessert after the worst meal ever!  With so many restaurants in Scottsdale to choose, we just had a bad evening. Lots of diners eat outside in the front. We were seated inside and it was not designed with the feeling of an older House.   It was like eating under a tent.  I never complain, but this was a real expensive disappointment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for the first time last night and it was awesome :) we were seated outside which is so cute and quaint. Cannot wait to come back when the weather starts to cool down. My husband ordered the filet which he loved! I wasn't as hungry so I ordered the Mac and cheese and it was really good as well. The drinks were really good also..I got the gimlet and it was delicious. This restaurant has such a great feel and the staff was so friendly. Great overall experience and perfect date night :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place is beautifull inside and have a warm feeling to it. The patio had an intimate ambiance. I sat at the bar and had some of the shared plates like steak tartar and arugula salad. Portion size was small so definitely you have to order couple plates. When ordering from the menu make sure you ask what comes in it so you won't be surprise because items change more often. \nWell done overall and staff were very friendly and helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery disappointed. For $30s-$40's for a dinner entree, much better options around Scottsdale. Won't be going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving so many options for Christmas Eve dinner, we chose to go to the House, one of our favorite \"Go To\" date night spots.  My husband is a vegetarian, so there were many delicious side options for him.  I ordered the filet, which I have had in the past, and enjoyed very much.  Tonight, the filet preparation was just \"off\" to say the least.  It was tough and simply not a good cut of meat.  Our server was amazing, and she kindly returned it to the kitchen.  They sent out another filet, this time, well over cooked.  The manager, Vincent, came by to check on my meal, and I honestly let him know that my meal was \"OK\".  I felt awful that I couldn't honestly say it was up to the usual House standard, and Vincent insisted that they bring me another entree to make it right.  He suggested I try the swordfish, and it truly was amazing.  Vincent made our entire evening enjoyable and we were so happy with the service once again.  I understand that every restaurant can have an off night, and tonight, the entire staff at the House made our dining experience right...and we will definitely be back again.  Brunch is one of our favorites at the House!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst decision ever to change the brunch menu! Absolutely disappointing! No pork belly, no fried rice, and meat balls. Giant thumbs down on the menu change! The server is still uhh-mazing! Awesome vibe and awesome service!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first visit here was for the annual company holiday party and I'm jonesing to come back! The party was in December around 6pm at night - so when we arrived it was dark. The parking lot for The House Brasserie is actually pretty small, but luckily there is valet parking nearby or if you are really lucky, a spot on the street might be available. My husband and I valet parked then walked to the restaurant. Walking up you really get to take in the whole scene. The patio is lighted beautifully at night and feels very welcoming. (A little history:  The House actually used to be an older house converted into a restaurant, so the front \"yard\" is the patio, the \"driveway\" is the parking, and where a covered garage would be is the bathrooms.) \n\nWe were greeted by a hostess and we indicated we were here for the holiday party. She guided us to the back of the patio, where a large canopy was set up with three long tables and plenty of heaters. Everything looked really nice and one of our servers for the evening stopped by for drink orders. Since I looked up the venue before the party, I knew the House was known for its in-house craft cocktails and asked for a menu. She was happy to oblige and came back saying every cocktail is made by hand with fresh ingredients. After mulling it over, I decided on a blueberry and yoghurt liqueur cocktail. After the first sip, I was in heaven. I admit, I almost didn't order it because it had yoghurt liqueur but let me tell you, it made the drink creamy, refreshing, and decadent. I really enjoyed my drink and ordered a few more throughout the evening.\n\nWhen we finally sat down to start the multi-course meal, our waitress brought out the House Brisket and Biscuit with chili jam and white cheddar. The brisket was tender and juicy with a hint of spice from the jam. Next appetizer was the Jerk Chicken inside lettuce with cashews, banana and grapes. This was one of my favorite appetizers - it was both sweet and savory. I would definitely order this the next time I am back. Next on the list was the Brussel sprout salad. This had olives and parmesan cheese. This was good, but not my favorite. Finally, the actual entrees starting coming out. First was a delicate salmon atop parmesan white beans with artichokes, tomatoes and pistachios. The salmon was cooked to perfect - a little crunchy on the outside but flakey and moist on the inside. Definitely one of the best salmon dishes I've had.  Next, the Roasted Jidori Chicken with risotto was brought out. The chicken was extremely tender and moist but the risotto.... Oh, this was perfection. It was the perfect texture with mushrooms and oh so tasty. The final entre was the Creekstone Filet with roasted corn. The filet came out about medium and was extremely tender. At this point, I wasn't sure if I could eat any more but it was heavenly... so I did. For dessert, mini salted caramel shakes were served with fresh house baked cookies. \n\nOverall, the entire multi-course meal was amazing. Being able to try so many items off the menu was pure food heaven and prepped me for when I go back. I will definitely be ordering the jerk chicken appetizers and the salmon with a blueberry yoghurt cocktail. If you are ever in the area, definitely check it out. Even if you aren't, grab a date and make plans! This is one of Scottsdale's restaurants that should not be missed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready loved this place before tonight but after trying their smoked Manhattan cocktail - I'm putting it on my list of \"Safe spots to send your friends to and not worry about looking like a jackass\"..  As soon as my group walked into the bar we were greeted by the bartender (Kenny I think is his name). He made our Manhattan's to perfection and treated my douchebag friends with undeserving respect.  The food menu is also amazing, I have had it several times and it never disappoints.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely amazing! Our waitress set us up with a variety of recommendations. Everything was delicious, the roasted cauliflower and Baja grouper were my absolute favorites. This was a beautiful evening that stands out as one of my best restaurant experiences ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I went there Friday night and has an 8:30 reservation. Got sat right away. The dinner from the Brussels sprout salad through the Swordfish and the Beer Brined Chicken was about the best we have every had....THE CHICKEN ROCKS...the service was perfect and it has the best garden sitting in the city. We met the manager and he took the time to share the history of the house and the chef. Go try this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nNever got to the food. We (2) were seated next to a party of 8 when the place was 80% empty. It was so tight, we had to shift the chairs for the wait staff to get through. Asked the young hostess and she said she couldn't move us as the front garden was reserved for 3pm Valantine's Day folks. It was 12:50pm.  Meanwhile, the waiter was pantomiming the words \"No\" and making a slashing sign with his hand past his throat to the Hostess. Apparently, he didn't want her to move us.  All this while standing behind my wife, not realizing I saw it all. Some customer service training/reasonable accomodation response is highly in order. Good bye. Too bad, other trips there were very good experiences the past few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust WOW again. Came by on foot with my dog and decided to dine at The House for lunch. Again, the patio incredibly comfortable, my dog welcomed with water. My ice tea very good and refreshing, the arugula salad great. Service fantastic from newbie Nicole, and managers Debbie and Watson stopped by to see how everything was. On Debbie's recommendation I had the chicken parmesan sandwich. This is something I would have never considered on my own and it was Amazing. Thank you to The House!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful, welcoming ambiance with unique preparation & warm friendly staff!\n\nWe tried this spot for a girls date- we choose our spots on the criteria they must have cocktails or wine, good veggie options, and be someplace the husbands aren't excited about trying. \n\nWe arrive around 6pm and there are very few people though some at the small bar.  We are greeted by a dapper gentleman and then a girl asks if we've been helped.  We opt to inside despite a large party arriving soon.  Nice they gave us a heads-up because said party was super loud.\n\nWe start with a blueberry hill & gimlet cocktail with basil & raspberry.  Both delicious not-over sweet and balanced.  Unique enough to entice but not so unique you avoid it.  The chef sends a delicious cheesy pastry as an amuse bouche which is light salty and delicious.  \n\nThe food here all looks delicious but we were most excited for the sides and salads- no mains really enticing us as we don't prefer meat usually and the only veg entree is tofu.  There are still so many great things we struggle to decide.\n\nThe mj bread is a lightly grilled pretzel bread & almond pumpernickel of sorts. \n\nWe share both the Arizona arugula salad and simple salad which are light & refreshing.  We both prefer the arugula salad due to the delicious vinegarette and plentiful toppings.  \n\nWe also share the pesto potatoes which was the highlight of the food.  Yummy tender fingerlings with warm Brie & nutty pesto.\n\nWith dinner, my friend goes for a blueberry hill again and I try the acai tequila \"world\" drink which is my ultimate tangy margarita I've been searching for.  Delicious & refreshing.\n\nFor dessert we opt for the chocolate bundito which is a graham cracker cookie served alongside a little jar of chocolate goodness with homemade banana marshmallow.  This dessert has amazing gooey texture that you must feverishly lick your spoon to get every last drop.  We mentioned how we loved the cookies & our sweetheart sever says \"well next time well bring extra\".  \n\nSpeaking of service- the people here obviously take pride in their cuisine and love to create a great dining experience.  Our server Emmy was kind & good at listening to capture our requests with ease. \n\nNext time we will opt for the beautiful patio as it was a little warm out still.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter our third attempt for dinner at House Brasserie, the Hubs and I finally completed our mission for date night at the new spot this past Saturday.  We called the night before, and were fortunate enough to get their very last reservation for the night at the high-top table in the bar.  As our wonderful waitress informed us, we were sitting at the best table in the house and I can confidently say I agree.  Parking was a bit tricky, but once we walked in I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant itself is very romantic with great lighting and interesting decor, especially in the bar area.  Our waitress took the time to tell us about the amazing house that is now the restaurant, and it made me appreciate the experience that much more.\n\nAs far as the food/drinks go, this place isn't cheap by any means.  The prices are worth it though (for the most part).  I had the watermelon cooler, which was refreshing and interesting - I would probably try something else next time, but all in all it was good.  The best things we ate were the brisket and biscuit and the goat cheese cheesecake.  HOLY SMOKES!  Those two things were close your eyes and have a moment good - even three days later I am still thinking about them.  A must for sure.  The biggest miss we had was the shrimp with sweet corn.  Just didn't taste too great and it wasn't anything special like the brisket and cheesecake.  We shared the lamb pasta and duck confit meatballs.  I felt like these were pretty good, but didn't blow me away like the previously mentioned items.\n\nSo thankful we finally made it to House.  We love the Mission and are equally pleased with House.  The service was fab as was the food, so in my humble opinion this spot is a homerun!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a small Bistro with a patio in Old Town Scottsdale. The building is an older converted house so there are very few parking spaces so you have to park in the street. The interior is dark and sort of dark shabby chic with lots of candles and old mirrors. The menu is Modern American with international accents and prepared using French Techniques.\n\nI drove across town to try this restaurant for the restaurant week menu that was three courses with an amuse bouche for $45.00 a person. When I was seated I didn't receive a restaurant week menu and there was no mention of restaurant week from my server so I had to ask about it. I thought that seemed weird to me and afterwards the server quickly handed out restaurant week menus that differed slightly from what was posted online. It turned out to be an even better menu that what was posted.\n\nFor restaurant week they gave us two amuse bouches, a generous glass of wine and three great courses.\n\nThe first amuse bouche was so tasty I could have eaten a bowl of them. They were little scoops of yummy corn bread with pickled mushroom and a fresno chili. It was like a little taste of Thanksgiving.\n\nMy first course was the malted rice with mushroom dashi. It was just delicious! I never had anything like that before.\n\nMy main course was the Scottish Salmon. The fish tasted and was prepared just as well as the salmon I had at Bouchon's in Napa Valley. It was perfect. The cauliflower and dill topping complimented the fish without over powering it and those horseradish pickles on the side might have been the most interesting pickles I ever tasted. They were delicious and I wish I could buy a jar of them.\n\nFor dessert the roasted apple pain perdu with melted camembert and cider caramel was a perfect balance of savory and sweet. It also was light in texture and oh so buttery. It was just delicious.\n\nService was superb.\n\nIt was a great dinner and worth driving across town for.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice creative menu in a beautiful setting. Great cheese plate and more\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House sits on a quiet tucked away lot in Old Town. I know; Not what you would typically expect , but it's delightful and romantic in its beauty from the street. It's quiet so you don't know Old Town is bustling right there! \n\nWalking in thru The House, the rustic, yet fancy appeal is perfect for this fall evening and on to the patio we are guided with its white umbrellas and flickering small, white lights amongst woven vine'd fencing; this is exactly the setting I wanted for a night to celebrate my husband. \nWe were greeted with waters immediately and my purse was given a small nappie for my purse. Nice touch. We started with aperitifs : mine was the usual sparkling rose ; I am immediately impressed that the waitress suggested my daughter try a Housemade Lavender Lemonade , it was tasty and refreshing with a hint of lavender. My husband started with a Smoked Manhattan: Makers Mark; Carpano Antica; Cherry Cola Redux; Smoked Alder; & Black Walnut Bitters. Tasty! But strong! This is when the 'amuse bouche' of small cheese courgettes arrived. These small biscuity puffs are full of flavor and honestly , could fill you up! \nWe love foie gras. Here in Arizona we find the rich, french, tasty, good stuff hard to find! Here at The House, it's exceptional and excellent! Ours had a fruity relish that I can't quite recall, with toasted bread points and again.. ALL kinds of yum! \n\nOn to our entrees: My daughter and I both ordered the Creekstone Filet, which is housed upon Shishito Peppers; Roasted Corn ( although I can not have , and they had no issues removing ) and a Sherry Onion Demi. It came with amazing mashers too and this filet was all kinds of filling and perfectly flavored & prepared. My husband had the Baja Grouper; a ample serving of amazing white fish also cooked to perfection over Hedgehog Mushroom; Zucchini; Chorizo; a really unique Black Rice and Saffron Cream. We also all shared the Simple Salad; The Mac & Cheese ; and the Dungeness Crab Fried Rice. Rich! But worth a sampling! Needless to say, we came home, AS always with a ton of leftovers and our tastebuds happy! My daughter had to try Emily's Donuts which are served as 3 with 3 different sauces: Chocolate; Caramel and Apple were tonight's sauce. My husband was treated to a Chocolate Nut Torte. The House is a beautiful, swanky place that is perfect for date night; family night or even girls night ( there was a bachelorette party getting started here the night we dined! Fun! ) The wine list ; beer and mixology list is all on point and impressive. Even the bathrooms to the side of The House are worth a step in to ... they are some of the fanciest I've seen. Service was grand and we left happy and can't wait to try The Mission next and come back again.. my family simply hasn't stopped talking about The House a month later!\n\n\n\n\n\nCame for Sunday brunch, was blown away by the beautiful patio!! Duck chilechiles were awesome and half price bottles of wine is never a bad thing!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there with my roommate a few weeks ago and we loved it. Food and cocktails were fabulous! Definitely recommend the crab fried rice and the lobster gnocchi!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my top three restaurants in the valley. Creative and intensely flavorful food, killer atmosphere, knowledgeable/helpful and friendly staff. Food is a playful mix of French and modern American fusion. They also threw us a few surprises, like a delicious puff pastry amuse bouche and a shot of house-infused apple cinnamon bourbon at the end. Inside, the place almost looks like a French cottage, but with a few modern updates and a subtle trip-hop music selection, which is new school in a way that offsets the old-world decor in a fun way. Will absolutely be back with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here last Saturday night with another couple.  The ambience is nice, but so dark that we all needed to use our phones to read the menu.  Food was prepared well and artfully displayed.  Wine list was pricey, but a nice selection.  Service was terrible.  We couldn't get anyone to take our dessert and coffee order.  Was told our server was focused on a bigger party.  After 20 minutes, we needed to \"twist someone's arm\" to get us the check to leave.  It was not a really busy night since it was a couple days after Thanksgiving.  Definitely not worth the premium price.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo stars for service or lack thereof. Had a fantastic meal here without a wait person through 90% of the experience.\nDifficult to give a good review even though the food was outstanding.\nSat for a bit without any service ordered immediately. Found out after our meal that there were specials on the menu as overheard from another table who had wait service. Served s meal but no one ever checked to see if okay.\nHad to ask hostess for another drink or\nGo to bar ourselves as no one was ever coming to our table other than to drop off food.\nService did not equal prices \nFood was delicious\n\n\n\n\n\nIn town with friends, we wanted an early dinner and relaxed environment. The patio seating was delightful. The staff were very attentive and understanding as our group size dwindled when part of the group was delayed at the airport. We enjoyed tantalizing shared plates as starters - especially enjoying the lobster gnocchi and the bursts with bread and house made apple butter. Entrees were excellent as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was the absolute nuts. \n\nAmazing food, several attentive waiters for our table of 15 (which is a big deal because I usually feel like big parties are underserved), well priced wine. \n\nPotato appetizer was the highlight followed by the pork dish.  \n\nGreat place.  Highly recommend it when you want to spend a little something extra for a little something extra.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll drive 3 hours to have their cheesecake any day! Very cozy and quaint with a European flair. YUM!  Service is usually pretty sharp.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was referred to this establishment from Cowboy Caio as they didn't have their Buffalo Carpacioo. So I went to the house brasserie for their steak tartar which was a mistake.  It was a \"FAIL\" for anyone looking for a traditional steak tartar as it came with fries, a small pigeon? Yolk (overdone) which didn't add to the moisture of the dish which was more of a pate than a tartar.  Very disappointed!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcited to give the House another try since their opening. Our welcome consisted of not being offered the open \"champagne\" at the front door, because it was not busy enough to warrant a splash. However, there were no outside seating available, yet open tables were visible. \n\nThe appeal of the bar drew us in and we enjoyed a great glass of wine, beer and appetizer.   (Side note) we asked the sophisticated couple next to us their suggestion and all they could say was, food great and cold. Aware that the enjoyable coveted outside seating was not available we decided to order our entree at the bar. ( it is the \"House\" and dinners are made to be shared) we ordered the Tradori chicken.   Unfortunately, we were denied once again because they only a have certain amount of food for the restaurant and would not allow us to order entrees at the bar.  Needless to say we went to the other less pretentious \"House\" Eddies.  Bon appetite\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely delicious! LOVED the ambiance - my husband and I sat on the patio and it was perfect. The service was out of this world and the food... oh the food... if this place wasn't on the pricier side (and rightfully so) I would be here every night! My new favorite restaurant. I don't eat meat and was a little concerned about having something to eat - when I let the server know and asked for recommendations, he told me about a leek and potato ravioli special that was one of the best dishes I've ordered. My husband ordered another special, halibut with squash blossoms, and he loved it! We also had their cornbread and guacamole and a salad to start - both of which were insanely good. We can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been to this all around marvelous restaurant on numerous occasions and LOVE it! The ambiance exudes beauty, character and charm. Like every one of their stylish establishments, I walk in feeling like a dignitary, confident that anyone I bring will have an exceptional experience. \n\nMatt carter never fails to deliver the most delectable assortment of food choices catering to the palate of any level of sophistication. They offer a wide variety of small plates as well as family style entrees using the finest and freshest ingredients resulting in a staggering eruption of favors in every bite. My last visit i had the bound corn and leek, creamy tomato soup served with sourdough gruyere grilled cheese and fresh Oregon truffle slices And the sweet yet savory country pork ribeye, served with popcorn grits, apple glaze with braised fennel. I am convinced they add crack to every dish because it is ADDICTING!!\n\nIt doesn't stop there either. The bar does not fall behind to the slightest degree. Definitely try the Housemade root beer and the famous cinnamon whiskey fireball shots (they use their own secret ingredients) one of my favorites is the sazerac square- sazerac whiskey aperol and fresh grapefruit ( yummmmmmmy!) and an absolute must have is the Irish coffee made with a hand picked house espresso, Jameson whiskey, topped with a Madagascar vanilla whipped cream and Demerara sugar pieces, I am not a coffee drinker and had 4!\n\nThe best part of the restaurant is the fun and friendly staff. Brian and kevin definitely know how to have fun and will show you the time of your life!!!!! Needless to say if you haven't been by yet you need to stop in as of yesterday!!! They are open for lunch, brunch on the weekends and dinner 7 nights a week so what are you waiting for!!!!?????\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scottsdale for business, we wrapped up,our trip at The House.  What a great choice.  We started with foie gras and the cheese apps. My first time with foie gras.  Had to try it, not bad not sure it's for me though.  I had the veal chop.  Other than being slightly overcooked, (asked for med rare, got pretty heavy med). Other than that it was still a pretty darn good veal chop.  Couple others had the scallops which were amazing.  Our other companion had the ribeye, also amazing.  The crab fried rice was fantastic!\n\nI will certainly eat here again when back in town.\n\nWell done!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here twice and had two different experiences. \n\nThe first was five star. The waiter told us the history of the restaurant and the inspiration behind their food. He made great recommendations on food and wine pairings. The lobster gnocchi appetizer melts in your mouth, the gnocchi are like soft pillows and the sweet lobster balances perfectly with the truffle. \n\nThe second visit was on New Years Eve. While I will visit this restaurant again I will never be back on New Years Eve. We did have a party of 8 which I know can be difficult. The full menu was offered which was nice but it made the evening very slow. We were often forgotten about, waiting for food with empty drinks. Appetizers came out staggered with one completely forgotten. We waited an hour for appetizers and our dinner order had yet to be taken. After ordering dinner it took 75 minutes to arrive. At 45 minutes our waitress said it was just getting plated, at 60 minutes she came back and said the EXACT same thing. I mentioned she had said that before and she admitted she knew it was taking a long time and apologized. A bottle of wine was comped but overall the service was unacceptable. \n\nThe food was excellent when it arrived. The tartare had the perfect amount of acid, gnocchi was as great as I remembered, the fries were salty and crispy, lamb bolognese was tender, someone said their filet was one of the best ones they've had in awhile and the pork chops were  massive but looked delicious and raved about. \n\nWhile New Years was disappointing, I get it. If they were to offer a set menu I think the timing would have been better/easier for the kitchen and staff. I'll keep this place on the list for date nights and intimate dinners with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother impressive accomplishment from the team responsible for The Mission and Zinc Bistro.\n\nIn consistent form, House Brasserie is a unique and enjoyable dining experience.  The eclectic light fixtures and wallpaper establish a feel of elegance that is both comfortable and approachable.  The menu delivers creativity and variety with a number of small plates that are perfect for sharing. The cocktail list is fun balancing some familiar classics with a few innovative options as well.\n\nThe difference between good and great often lies in the details, and once again those are well attended to at House Brasserie.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy apologies for not writing this review earlier, but you can thank me now.  I have had the pleasure of dining at The House Brasserie on more than a handful of times during brunch, lunch and dinner.  When I find a new place that I obsess about, I find myself making up reasons to return and the holidays provided just the perfect excuse!\nThis is an old house that has been converted into a restaurant.  You will feel like you have been transported out of Arizona.  I am already thinking of throwing a baby / wedding shower on the beautiful patio.\n\nI will start with brunch, the brunch menu is limited at this point but the staff said Chef Carter plans to add more selections.  But heck, I do not need more selections. I dined with 2 friends and we started with the family style marscapone eggs.  These eggs were exceptionally tasty and fluffy and serve with warm baguette on the side.  The highlight tho was the crepe. This should come as no surprise since the chef said his first job in France was as a creperie.  The crepe was filled with marscapone with just the right amount of sweetness and topped with an assortment of fresh warm berries. I begged the manager to add this to there dessert menu so I could indulge more often.\n\nI have had the pleasure of dining at The House for lunch a couple of times, an absolutely charming place to enjoy and leisurely lunch on the patio.  Luckily I have dined with friends who do not mind sharing a bite of there meal.  I have been impressed with all of the items. So far I have tried the turkey, pastrami, chicken parm, shaved pork belly and the double burger. All of these sandwiches are served with outstanding crinkle fries.  The standout sandwich was the shaved pork belly BUT you really cannot go wrong with any of the selections from my experience. \n\nOn to dinner, where to begin...  I definitely recommend starting with one of the amazing homemade soups and salads.  I love the kale salad. Then you can go in either directions and try a bunch of share plates or order a entree. I have done them all but whatever I order I an sure to get the kale salad and popcorn bacon grits; simply divine. \n\nSee you again soon House Brasserie!! I love you\n\n\n\n\n\nNever disappointed!  Menu is unique and hard to pick just one dish to try.  A must do in Scottsdale.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decor was amazing and the service was fantastic. The food was absolutely immaculate. The lamb dish was to die for and the chicken was very succulent and had nice sauces. The wild sea bass was cooked to perfection! The appetizers and salads are also very tasty. It was a very good overall experience. I would defiantly like to go back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI should give 2 stars but I'm feeling generous. I really like the place and want to give it another chance.  This was the second time here after a great first time.  I think this was a Murphy's Law meal.  It happens once in a great while.  The ambience and service are fine.  No issue there.  My food was the problem. I ordered the scallops minus the creamed cabbage, I avoid most dairy.  I asked for the Brussels sprouts from their chicken dish instead.  They didn't want to substitute.  The bartender spoke with the kitchen and they agreed to go ahead and do it.  I get the dish and it is enveloped with creamed cabbage all over the scallops and no Brussels sprouts.  I tell the guy that delivered it and he takes it away.  I decide to just play it safe and order something else.  A side of lobster fried rice.  I told them to make it as is because I didn't want to special order anything and I'm ok with egg in fried rice.  It shows up with no egg, underdone, lobster cold in the middle, yuck.  It was basically mushy rice, some lobster, and coconut milk I think.  Bland and disgusting.  I had ordered a cab and my wife ordered a champagne cocktail.  When we finished one round we both said we wanted the same.  The bartender took that as we both want a champagne cocktail.  That would be a big fat No.  Anyways, I told her and she gave me the cab.  The bartender was sweet and was trying but things were just not going well.  I was hungry and frustrated so I just let it go and said fuck it.  It happens.  Loved the place the first time and will try it again but let's hope that Murphy's Law doesn't get involved next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHUNGRY! That is how our party of 7 felt after we had dinner at this restaurant.  The patio is lovely - but that is the only thing House Brasserie has going for it. The short ribs were dry, overcooked and full of fat.  The salmon and chicken were also very overcooked.  We were so disappointed!  We have been here before and things have certainly changed.  We definitely will NOT be returning.  Very expensive for a lot of   NOTHING!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe menu is super exciting. The music sexy.  This would be a 5 star review. The food is effing amazing. I need a moment with my lamb. \nThe service, well.....\n\n1. I didn't order wine, please remove my glasses\n2. Bubbly & a cocktails shouldn't take long. Did you go to France to get my bubbles? Are you growing the trees for the oranges?  Don't tell me that the bar got busy. The table sat after us got their drinks quickly. And they had wine & a cocktail. Hmmmm \n3. Don't try to give me bread plate to \"prepare me for possible slow kitchen\".  \n\nThankfully the excellent food was delivered promptly. Still service is lacking, except for the bus boy. He was prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was awful but the food was worst.  A number of dishes from the chef's tasting menu, which is $75 per person, were over-seasoned and unimpressive.  The potatoes and carrots in the turkey pot pie were undercooked in addition the turkey stew had way too much pepper which blew away my palate.  The following course was a white fish that was so salty that it was inedible.  Save your time, money, and palate by going to either the Citizen Public House or Tommy V's Urban Kitchen in downtown Scottsdale for a better meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a fantastic experience, I had a work group of 12 people scheduled for dinner on a Sunday night, got to the House, no reservation in there system, my admin in Chicago dropped the ball, I'll deal with that later, the staff at the restaurant gave a big \"it's not a problem give us a few minutes to set the table\" all is good. We order cocktails really good from beers, martinis and mules all excellent. Apps around the table fantastic. Salad and soups came out quickly, then we had a delay for entrees, the manager comes out and informs us that there POS system had crashed, not good! But the team recovered quickly steaks were \"perfect\" other entrees way above average. Also the patios on a nice October night is down right beautiful. I highly recommend the House Brasserie!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally cute little restaurant tucked away in downtown Scottsdale. Somewhat expensive but great unique dishes, beautiful outdoor seating and wonderful service. Nice wine list too.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were excited to come here.   Friends did say it was fantastic.   Our experience was different.   Food was average at best.  Wife got the grouper and didn't care for it.  I got the lobster gnocchi and it was a bit salty. I also ordered the tomahawk porkchop.  It was burnt to a char on the outside.  Smoked Manhattan was average.  I've had better drinks at other places.  The dessert menu was uninspiring.  We ended up going to hillstone for their sundae.  Service was average.  Our meal was $150, and at that price point there are a lot of better options such as any Hillstone restaurant, Virtu, Monarch Cafe, Elements and Olive & Ivy to name a few.  I wanted to like this place.  If you're debating on a place to go, House Brasserie would not be my first choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nFull review in the blog.  This place has potential, but thus far that potential is not fully realized.\n\nseven plates, four desserts...and a $1 'bread supplement'\n\n\"Shrimp and Grits,\" a savory and intense composition of sweet and snappy head-on shrimp atop creamy popcorn grits enlivened by charred onions and smoky pork glaze with a touch on honey.  Sweet and savory but perhaps a bit steep at $14 this was a dish where the ingredients and the execution came together beautifully.\n\n\"Arizona Ricotta, Sicilian Pistachio Toast, Roasted Radish\" at $8 arrived as a trio with only a single flaw - a dearth of salt to liven up the otherwise beautifully cooked radish.  A bit of a disappointment even despite the high quality of the tender taproot the dish certainly improved in moving on to the bread crisps as the ricotta was ever so slightly melted while the bread itself was herbal and crunchy but at the same time subtle.  With a bit more salt this one could be great.\n\nFor Duck Confit Meatballs, Foie Gras, White Bean, Tomato Agrodolce it would be hard to say exactly how/why such decadent ingredients did not live up to my expectations, particularly as the meatballs were tender and rife with flavor, but if I had to pin it on one thing I think it would be the expectations arising with the word \"Foie Gras\" and the $14 price tag as the sapor of the foie was largely lost to the tomatoes while the puree of white bean was okay, but mostly just filler.\n\nBerkshire Pork Belly, Kimchee, Udon Noodle, Fried Egg arrived with some joking at the table about the ubiquity of pork belly these days and as much as I cannot argue that said ingredient is delicious I just didn't find it well utilized here as the fattiness of the swine simply overwhelmed any semblance of kimchee while the noodles were soggy and limp.  Decent flavors though garnished by a rather inconsequential egg I had a few bites and that was enough.\n\n\"Maine Lobster Fried Rice, Mullet Egg, Aji Amarillo\" was actually a rather nice plate of risotto with a lot of umami and a touch of heat but \"fried rice\" it most certainly was not.  Nice enough, but certainly not a sharable plate, one of my tablemates summed it up perfectly when he commented that all this dish really did was make him want to go elsewhere and get a dish of \"kick ass\" fried rice - something he could have done at 1/3 the tab and had enough for lunch the next day.\n\nMoving last to a pair of sides, each $6 and far more generous than the rice, Grilled and Buttered Shiitake Mushrooms, Truffle Honey along with Grilled Broccoli Carbonara, Pancetta, Egg, Black Pepper arrived and where the first showed strongly in its simplicity the second fell flat once again due to a lack of salt - a lack so pronounced that frozen broccoli straight from the bag has more flavor thus making me wonder exactly what sort of pancetta was even present.\n\nButtermilk Blackberry Crumb Cake arrived as a dense butter cake with a downhome toothsomeness that I really enjoyed, but with ample notes of buttermilk dominating the sweetness of the berries I think this one could have benefitted from one of two things - a dollop of ice cream or a cup of coffee.  I'd definitely order this as a breakfast item anywhere.\n\nCaramel Apple Upside Down Cake, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio Ice Cream.  A long and linear presentation with the apple flavor a bit overwhelmed by the salty caramel but still potent and tart what truly made this plate shine was the ice cream - creamy, rich, and rife with nutty flavor...had we been dining earlier I'd have probably driven over to Sweet Republic for another round.\n\nUnder other circumstances Sacher Torte would have been the highlight of the meal and served with \"Toasted Almond Amaretto Mascarpone Mousse\" this one was a fine example.  Dense, intensely cocoa, and appropriately dry without suffering the Americanization of making it too birthday-cake in texture this was another dessert that would have gone great with coffee but the use of the mousse and bold apricot flavor kept everything balanced and bright.  It was awesome.\n\nIf there is one thing The House should keep doing from this point until the day they close their doors it should be keeping the Butterscotch Pudding on the menu.  A fan of all puddings - from rice to bread to budino - and having had a number of similar presentations elsewhere this version was simply outstanding - sweet and salty, dense and creamy, and bespeckled with chocolate and fruit adding both texture and flavor.  It goes on the short list for Phoenix's best desserts and will likely remain there for some time.\n\nOverall, The House is off to a decent start but still has a lot of room for growth in every department except perhaps dessert and dcor.  A lovely setting already with great service I think the focus should start with improved seasoning and working to nail the basics before experimenting with 'fusion' and once the kitchen is hitting on all cylinders perhaps improving the portion/price ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time we went here the service was amazing and the food was great. We sat outside by the fireplace which was very special and romantic. Tonight the food was once again fantastic but the waitress was so so at best. For this price I would expect professional, warm, passionate, and engaged servers. All the support staff was really great. We ordered the $6 coffee which is really good but the waitress would have left it until it was cold if we wouldn't have asked the bus boy to help us. \n\nAlso, if you sit inside be ready to talk over loud and odd music. Also be ready to share your conversation with the patrons on both sides because there is very little room. \n\nAll in all I would still recommend The House Brasserie but it has way more potential than it is delivering.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is fantastic, been there twice and going again today.  The brunch   selections are perfect, service  is amazing and the decor is beautiful.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many dinners at the house, last night was the disappointment.\n\n1.  Hostess called to confirm our reservation. We were told we would need to leave out table promptly at 8:45 to give our table to the next reservation. The restaurant was never at capacity with many empty tables throughout the evening.\n\n2. Whe we were sat there were no menues! The restaurant was half full and they don't have any menu's? Really?  We waited 15 minutes to get a menu.\n\n3.  The Crab rice was WAY oversalted! After bringing this to the managers attention, we were told it was to the chef's taste.  Minutes later the manager returned to the table and said the chef tasted the rice and it was oversalted when prepares by the sous chef, they pulled it from service.  Does the chef not taste his own food?\n\nI have frequently dined here, this last dinner may be just that.......the last.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisappointed. Been wanting to come here for a while and I wish it had been better. The place is very cute, small and romantic. We sat at the bar while waiting for our table. The bartender was lovely and the specialty cocktails were super tasty. I had the Manhattan which was delicious. We sat and ordered promptly. It took about 25-30 minutes for us to get our food. The food we received was our entrees. However we had ordered an appetizer which just never showed up. Our server apologized and asked if we wanted it then, with our entrees in front of us. We declined. My SO's steak was cooked very well. I had the pork chop which was ok. The broccolini side was tasty, but the egg was slightly over poached and the yolk was not very runny. We had a dessert cocktail which was very good. We were also served complimentary limoncello. However when our server returned with the check I glanced down and then looked up and she had bussed my limoncello of which I had only had one sip. For some reason it really irked me to be served something complimentary and then have it removed before I had the chance to even enjoy it. Definitely left me with a bad taste. There are definitely some positives to the place but I'm not itching to go back. Oddly enough, if I did go back, I think it'd just be to go to the bar!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is awesome hands down the best place to go to in old town for anything great food they make me look good I'm a cab driver when I recommend this place to people they call me thanks that place was great we love it\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most charming restaurants I've ever been too with a powerhouse, creative menu!  We sat outside under a giant canopied tree with standing lamps, candles, a warm breeze right at sunset.  Beyond the cozy setting, the food was simply delicious. I enjoyed the lamb bolognese which was perfect for spring. That paired with Stag Leap Petit Syrah was just perfection. I will be back when I return to Scottsdale next month!\n\n\n\n\n\nHands down one of the most consistent yet unique, romantic dining spots in Greater Phoenix. Many visits, never disappointed, and more than once service WAY beyond expectations .  Literally an impromptu tasting when it was an otherwise slow summer night, and another night the pressed clean shirt straight from the GM, when I blew it with my red wine covering my white shirt, was beyond belief. My fault and yet they somehow still made it an amazing experience without embarrassing me one iota. That's class. That's service. And it's innovative 5-star food on top of that!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow having tried all 3 restaurants owned by Broken Plate Concepts, The Mission, Zinc Bistro, and then finally The House Brasserie. The House Brasserie loses. Maybe it was an off night, but with those prices you shouldn't have an off night. Dinner for 2 at 6:15 on a Saturday night on one of the coldest windiest nights in Arizona, we were seated next to the patio door that was being used regularly with huge gust of cold air blowing on us, not to mention the table next to us. The restaurant accommodated us and moved us quickly. Luckily it was not full, because we would of left if there was no other table. Our server Katie was excellent. She first announced all the item menus that were not on the menu that evening, The Baked Robiola, The Clam Chowder and the Main Lobster Bisque. Really?, On a Saturday night at 6:15 you run out of all those items, which I personally was looking forward to trying the Lobster Bisque, bad kitchen planning and management.\n\nWe ordered cocktails, a Cosmo and The Smoked Manhattan, both excellent. Appetizers were Virginia Ham (corn bread, jalapeno peanuts, bourbon, maple) and the Cold Creekstone Steak Tartare (roasted pepper, romesco, frites). The Steak Tartare was very good. The Ham was very OK, too little meat, too much Corn Bread. For Entrees we ordered The Veal Chop (bernaise, charred cucumber), The Spice Cured Duck Leg Confit (smoked pasilla cherry glaze, cornbread \"stuffing,\" foie gras, caper, brussels sprouts, pearl onion) and Spicy Broccoli Raab (san marzano tomato, calabrian chili, black garlic). All 3 dishes were missing the target. The Veal, though beautiful looking and perfectly done was tough and should melt in your mouth for $50. The Duck, the flavor was there but again the duck was tough, not tender as a confit should be, and the brick of cornbread served no purpose. The Broccoli Raab tasted OK, though not spicy at all and was soaking in the sauce. Again an off night. I don't know what's amiss after dropping $200+ on a meal for 2.\n\nAtmosphere and decor we loved, service excellent, food missed the mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything was great. I will be back. I would recommend this location to anyone that wants to eat great food. So glad I found this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelish! Went for valentines. Loved the atmosphere, great date night spot. The service was great but the food was even better. My boyfriend got the filet he said it's better than what he has gotten at Mastros and Ruths Chris. Also the Mac and cheese is amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a very short list of restaurants that we will bring foodie friends visiting from out of town for a special dinner. After our second meal there, House Brasserie is definitely in the rotation (the others, in case you're curious, are Crudo, Roka Akor and Virtu).\n\nThe setting is intimate and the lighting is great. it's not so loud you can't have a conversation, but not so quiet that it lacks energy.\n\nThe service is truly top notch. On both occasions out waiter was Tommy. He was attentive, helpful, professional and pleasant. He made great recommendations yet never intrusive. Food came at the right times and temperatures.\n\nOn this occasion we dined with a group and tried just about everything on his suggestion. The cheese and meat boards he brought were fantastic appetizers. The scallops were the star entree. The pasta with lamb ragu was also outstanding. As sides the grits, broccoli and gratin potatoes were all done perfectly. Only problem is that we had no room for dessert!\n\nOne of the true 5 star spots in Phoenix. Highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother overpriced and overrated  restaurant in the Valley.  Had an arugula salad that appeared mixed with other lettuce - was overly dressed, to the point of have soggy veggies.  Followed by the halibut which had a strangely metallic taste to it - definitely pass on this.  Not worth the splurge.Lackluster in my book, perhaps more of a 1 1/2 star place.\n\nThe ambiance is quaint, the service good - the waitresses wore matching dresses, but with a lower than necessary neckline, revealing more than necessary.  Easy parking.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the Creekstone fillet with the brussels. As I like my steaks cooked Pittsburgh with a cold rare center, it's not easy for most restaurants to make me happy, but the chef did an excellent job. The waitress was friendly and the overall noise was not overwhelming .I would definitely go back.\n\np.s. Definitely try the bread and butter appetizer. I don't know how they could do such a good job of making great bread.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for dinner Saturday night. Sat on the patio. The atmosphere was definitely high end and romantic. We had the kale salad, duck confit meatballs and the seared scallops. And for dessert, the caramel upside down apple pie. It was all delicious. I will definitely go again and look forward to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner was amazing! Although, a very compacted place the food was phenomenal. Server was consistent. The decor is really modern and my favorite  would be the velvet wall in the break room.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrunch started off well. The restaurant was incredibly cute with the feeling of walking into a cozy cottage decorated with flowers. Seemed like a great place for a bridal shower or girl's brunch. However, things quickly went downhill from there. \n\nThis establishment is operated by the same owners as The Mission which we went to the night before and all thought it was fantastic. Therefore, I'd like to assume that our experience was a one-off disappointment, however, I don't think any of us will be back to Phoenix for a while (all east-coasters) to actually prove that. \n\nThe restaurant was 90% empty when we arrived for our 1PM reservation. However, it still took them 15 minutes to bring us water and ask for our orders. We had to wait an additional 10 minutes for our drinks to appear. We had mentioned to them that we had a time constraint so please rush our food and drinks, however, it didn't seem that was taken into consideration. I would understand if the restaurant was crowded but it was majorly empty. When the food finally did come out, they forgot my meal and had to go back and search for it. \n\nWe were given a full menu to look over and were not told that only the brunch menu (on the last page) would be served. There is NOTHING worse than getting a menu, picking something you think sounds delicious, having your mind set on it, and then being told it is not available. If they are only intending on serving their brunch menu, generally restaurants only hand out their brunch menu during brunch. At the VERY least, we could have been told to disregard the 5 other pages of menu options prior to being seated. \n\nThe food was average and the pricing was also average for the area (but not for the service). We would have probably been a better eating experience if the service was at a higher level. We were all looking forward to a great Scottsdale brunch experience and left feeling very disappointed and, quite frankly, annoyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me clarify, we didn't actually eat. We went here on our way to a show... . We didn't have reservations admittedly, but let the wait staff at the door know that we were on our way to a show and just needed to know if we could  be sat in time. Rather than giving an answer they kept saying they were waiting on menus. They clearly didn't want to serve us, they indicated that we could eat in the bar but then didn't provide any service there.\nI walked away feeling like the staff were very elitist and the experience put a damper on our night out.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfect!  Great food, great ambiance, great drinks. My only complaint is that people seem to be catching on and it is getting busy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing atmosphere! They have a great patio in the fall it will be great. Just had a lovely Birthday dinner there. Chef Carter hits another one out of the part. I usually have the Ribeye, but opted for the pork chop. You need a to go box. They have redone the goat cheese cheesecake, birthday boy not a fan of goatcheese wants to go back just for that. And I would be remissed if I didn't mention the Brisket and Biscuit! \n\nI will be back for sure!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy fiance and I came here for Valentine's Day Dinner and it couldn't have been better.\n\nWe had a great table on the beautiful patio.\n\nService was outstanding.  Attentive, kind, and fun.  \n\nThe food was incredible.  We ordered appetizers, sides, and entrees, and all of it was delicious.\n\nBe prepared to spend around $150 for a table of 2.  If you can handle that, you'll be very happy you chose to come to The House Brasserie.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways walke past this place and finally decide to try it. Unique location which I liked. Wait staff was friendly and accommodating. Good drinks and old fashion was very good. The bake brie was very good and I am not a brie person we also had the chicken and gnocchi starter and that was very tasty. The Bolognese and swordfish for dine were tasty and flavorful. Portions were good, as they were just enough ( hate walking/ rolling out of a resturant because I ate to much). the drip coffee at the end was great. Would recommend to eat here\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of the best places that we have found in Scottsdale! The service was top notch and the food was impeccable! The drinks were very well made and their specialty cocktails did not disappoint. The food was fantastic! We split the daily special and loved it. The GM came over to our table to personally welcome us and our server was great. Will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere and wine list. Our server lacked basic product knowledge which I expect from a high-end restaurant. The food was fine, not spectacular, not worth the prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most amazing restaurant! The food and the ambiance is impeccable. The restaurant is stunningly beautiful. The farrow salad was so good.  My fianc raved about the brisket on a brisket he said the creamy cheese on top is heavenly.  Can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI adore this place. Food is always consistently great and the bar manager is always a great source of new whiskey suggestions. The outside patio area is cute and the inside is nice and cozy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs good as it gets.  Elegant..lovely..romantic.  Wonderful knowledgeable staff, awesome chefs..one most delicious culinary adventures ever had.  I highly recommend this when you are in Scottsdale.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, the atmosphere of this place is phenomenal. Sitting in the outdoor garden/patio makes you feel removed from all of Arizona and into a rustic countryside inn. I was excited for a great experience as I walked up to my friends who had already been seated. Unfortunately, the food took FOREVER to come out. We finally ate after twiddling our thumbs and repetitive requests about what's going on in the kitchen. Granted, we were a large party but the restaurant was not busy at all on the weekday dinner service. The food was nicely plated but I don't think the taste warranted the wait and price.  Too bad because this would be a perfect date night if the food were actually good. My lamb ragout was passable. I liked the little crostini better than the actual pasta dish.  My friend did say the ribeye was cooked very well and the halibut special got a nod. Manager did come over to apologize and tried to make things right for us which was appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and we loved it! Have been meaning to reserve here for a few years now but was not able to. Got a great romantic setting by the fireplace. The server asked us to wait at the bar while they cleared it up and it was well worth it. The food was delicious and the service was great. Very attentive staff. We are definitely coming back for other occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe absolutely love this place. Matt Carter uses the freshest ingredients around. They change the menu depending on the season and what is available. If you are a foodie get your butt in here.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll around excellent dining experience made for a perfect date night!\nFrom the friendly valet across the street to the attentive waitstaff and the friendly host, all were just terrific.\nThe food was excellent. The chef masterfully combined an eclectic array of ingredients to create flavor masterpieces. I personally loved that the chef was daring to push the spice limit... I enjoyed my Creekstone filet. finally something with flavor and heat. Not another safe, bland and boring steak dish!\nAwesome job!\n\n\n\n\n\nWas so cute! A hidden gem :) In an old house lies this restaurant covered by a huge beautiful pine tree. We had the house brisket and biscuit on a food tour last night. Sat outside under the tree. Started with a glass of prosecco. Kind of reminded me of restaurants in Napa, local fresh food. Laid back atmosphere like a summer day on the back porch. 4 stars because we didn't try everything and well...After looking at the menu it is a bit expensive. Definitely will be back for a romantic date night though!! They need a happy hour to be a bit more affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome patio, ambiance and service. Chef Carter and Brian are fantastic. Will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is amazing, the patio is even better. Anniversary brunch by the fire and even allowed us to bring our large dog.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis the most romantic place for foodies in Scottsdale. The service is five stars; the folks who work there love this place. Our server, Tommy McMahon, was amazing. Every recommendation was perfect. The goat cheese is the best I've ever had and the jam and bread really brings out the flavor.  Don't miss the smoked burrata; it is truly an interesting and delicious twist. Black kale salad is phenomenal. My husband had the rib eye and was in love. It came with a roasted garlic spread we could not get enough of. Each dish is thoughtful and done with creativity and care. If you love food this is a place you should not miss, it has everything, the ambience, service and culinary excitement!\n\n\n\n\n\nOh Holy Deliciousness!  This charming little place has made it to my favorites list with just one visit! The atmosphere is lively and comfortable as well as romantic and a little elegant. Think candlelit dining room and bar, chandeliers, and comfy chairs. There is a nice outdoor dining patio as well. We had dinner at the bar which we enjoyed even better than if we had a table in the dining room. The customer service from the minute you walk in the door was phenomenal! The bartenders were very knowledgeable in their trade as well as the restaurant's menu items. Keith was a master at directing us on the house specialties for drinks as well as food.  For the meal itself, we decided to do several of the small plates rather than two entrees. \n\nOur meal: \nBuratta with truffle oil - delishly rich\nPork Belly with Kimchi and udon noodle - the combination of flavors was amazing\nShort Ribs on a biscuit - (yes, we had pork belly and biscuits in the same sitting - don't judge!) this dish was devine\nApple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream - my husband says this is the best dessert he's had in a while\n\nI can't wait to go back for some of the items I didn't get to....we'll opt for the bar again, it was so much more fun!\n\n\n\n\n\nJust give it a try. Anything I say will not do it justice. A perfect special occasion go to. This place will be on top for a very long time.\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently only been open for 10 weeks and we have been to The Mission a number of times.  Wanted to go somewhere new tonight so looked on Yelp.  This is a sister restaurant to The Mission.  What a great experience.  Didn't have a reservation so bellied up to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks while we waited for the kale salad, lobster role, and filet with corn and balsamic reduction.  All fantastic.  Wouldn't have changed a thing.  The caramel upside down apple cake with pistachio ice cream.  Wow, awesome in general but the ice cream was unreal.  Good food, good drinks, good bartender, and good times.  Will be back and I would recommend that anyone check it out.\n\n\n\n\n\nif this is the place i recall.. the sangria was way over priced for what it was.   wayyyyyyyy to much ice in it. and the waitress and waiter kept bringing more cups of ice to us.   then one tried to pour some in a cup of ice they brought us and i said ummm no thank you its watered down enough.. then they looked at me like i was crazy and questioned me again why i didnt want it poured in the ice.   was not worth the price whatsoever.  plus there was broken pieces of glass on our table that we kept showing the waitress.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food, service and crafted cocktails! The snapper and skirt steak were impeccable!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nUsed to live in Scottsdale for years...back on spring break with friends.  Heard this was special.  It was off the charts with great covered quiet patio seating, excellent wines, amazing small plates.....black kale salad so good we ordered it again before entrees...scallops just right. Filet done to perfection. Definitely leave the kids home....even teens.  One of best dining experiences I have had.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh my goodness, so freaking good!  When we arrived the waitress told us all about the building and the restaurant.  We had a rather large group (10) and they were great with serving us.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely go there again and again!\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest restaurant disappointment of the year. I've had this place bookmarked for over a year and after coup de tarte closed its door, my husband and I have been searching for a new French favorite. When our anniversary came around I jumped at the chance to try this place out. \n\nThe restaurant is right smack downtown old town Scottsdale so I shouldn't have been shocked that parking didn't exist; we had to pay for valet across the street for the privilege of spending hundreds on dinner. Not a huge deal, but valet closed at 8pm and \"if you're staying longer, come get your keys before we close up\". Who closes valet at 8pm? My husband had to leave in the middle of dinner to get our keys. I know this isn't necessarily the restaurants fault, but they really should find a way to offer their clientele free valet (with a generous tip of course).\n\nThe restaurant as a whole is pretty charming but the patio had a huge tarp covering any sky view. \n\nThere was a HUGE party next to us and I was afraid that service and food speed was going to be rough. It wasn't. The servers are top notch. The wine menu was definitely overpriced; there was literally a $100 glass of wine. Wowza. That aside the wine and cocktails were probably the best part of the experience.\n\nFor dinner we ordered the pork chop, duck ragu and crab fried rice. My husband seemed to like the pork but it had such a bizarre seasoning or sauce that just didn't work. The duck Ragu was good for a few bites. After that it just became a soggy pile of pasta with mushy \"duck\". I ate about a fourth of the plate and gave up. Such a disappointment. The crab fried rice was really delicious and we both ate that first, over our entrees. Nice heat but I didn't find an bits of actually crab?!\n\nHonestly I feel this place is very overrated and hyped because it's cozy and the location is prime. Skip this and go to cafe monarch instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbience 4 stars\nService 4 stars\nFood 3 stars\n\nThe staff recommended the lamb bolognese but I didn't think it was all that special. What I truly enjoyed was the kale salad!   Next time I'll try the Mission, but will only return to House for patio seating and drinks. Thank you to our server who wrote down a couple of lounges for us to visit post dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing next weekend, made reservation for outside! Cant wait to try it. Will update my review once I go!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the most amazing brunch on Mothers Day.  The lady who wrote a book about her experience has way too much time on her hands.  The wait staff was excellent. The scrambled eggs with prosciutto and blue berry banana French toast was to die for. Unlimited mimosa and the beautiful bottle of chianti as a gift was a plus.  The goat cheese cake put us over the top. Can't wait to return. It's my new favorite neighborhood restaurant - and we have a lot of them in Old Town. The ambiance was just as fun as the food. See you back soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nA very nice find slightly off the beaten path in old town Scottsdale.  In a town overrun by big name steakhouses or wanna be trendsetters, this is an effective demonstration of vintage cuisine.  \n\nSure, I had the ribeye, but our party of 16 sampled most of what is on the menu.  The foie gras app is excellent (tough to mess that up, I know).  \n\nNext time, I promise to order an entree that is more French!\n\n\n\n\n\n11/14/12\n\nWhat a romantic spot!\n\nA friend and I decided we'd meet for dinner here (neither of us have ever been), and we elected to be seated outdoors.  Thank goodness it wasn't too chilly out, as I soon detected a repulsive sulfuric scent and were told by either manager Sal, or our server Todd, that the heat lamp was the likely source of the fumes and that he would turn it down to mitigate the repugnant odor.  Nice!  The setting outside was very pretty (lighted trees, window sills, and fences), but it quickly turned very dark, and not even the lone votive candle on our table could cast enough light for me to see my friend's face, much less read the print on the menu.  Thankfully, Todd brought us a couple of mini-flashlights to use.  \n\nWe started off by ordering the House brisket and biscuit http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=LkEx56NcRC4E9Xwo5W3qbQ#LkEx56NcRC4E9Xwo5W3qbQ, the Crab fondue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=t2WMfle_zu9MCgk-FTWP3g#t2WMfle_zu9MCgk-FTWP3g, the Arizona arugula salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=rMk1Ocoa7ddSbwltgPMXlA#rMk1Ocoa7ddSbwltgPMXlA, a Gone A-Rye cocktail for him, and a glass of Conn Creek cab sauv for me.  For entrees, he chose the Roasted Jidori Chicken (I said we could compare this dish to FnB's at a later date) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=679m8eFoykKTLfDrede3GA#679m8eFoykKTLfDrede3GA, while I was enticed by one of tonight's dinner specials, the Day scallop entree http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=v9AQf7SwNC7fbdbXGYTBNw#v9AQf7SwNC7fbdbXGYTBNw.  He chose another glass of Gone A-Rye, while I opted for a light and buttery Lioco chardonnay.\n\nHouse brisket and biscuit: Came with a brush of chili jam on the side, but didn't need it.  My favorite of all three apps, and I think it was his, as well.  I chose the biggest piece of the three, since he was going to get the other two!  \n\nI really liked the viscosity and the chunkiness of the fondue, which came with a lot of crab.   However, it was a little too sweet for me, so the saltiness of the accompanying toast was appreciated.  We didn't finish this one, even though I gave it my best shot.  \n\nThe salad was lovely- I enjoyed the crispness of the grilled slices of peach, which presented a gorgeous color and glaze!  The dressing was a little too acidic for me, but my friend thought it was just right.  I really liked the triple cream crostini that came alongside the salad, for it helped to cut the sourness of the salad's dressing.\n\nIf I weren't already too full with the apps and salad, I may have enjoyed the scallop entree a little more; However, the dish did arrive with a strong seafood odor, one more akin to say a shrimp dish, rather than the lighter scent of day scallops.  I found the bites too sweet, and a little too rich.  I enjoyed the salty and crisped bacon bits and the texture and flavor of the spaetzle, but came to find out a little too late that it had a mustard base, so I'm assuming it was taken off my friend's bill.  I do know that we were offered a complimentary dessert, but we were already too full, so I elected for the caffeine in coffee, which helps to lessen food allergy symptoms.  My first time trying Chemex, and the coffee was delicious!\n\nHope to return soon!\n\np.s.  He absolutely LOVED the roasted Jidori chicken.  It came with mushrooms that sounded divine.  Too bad I couldn't try any of it.  :(  I was able to sample the second Gone A-Rye cocktail (I wanted to try a \"spicier\" version of the first) and found it a little too bitter to enjoy.  I did, however, really like the heat.  Perhaps I could talk the bartender into making a spicy mango mojito for me to try in the future?\n\np.p.s.  The House is so adorable, even down to the \"outhouses,\" but I doubt these will be appreciated when winter comes.  I'm picturing heat lamps taking up more space in the already crowded walkways.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House has a beautiful patio with a great atmosphere, perfect for date nights! The food was very delicious and rich. Our server Anne was very helpful and easy going. The only thing that was unexpected was that our food was ''auctioned off'' and with the price of the food at this restaurant, that shouldn't be happening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't do shitty food, and we don't do sober\" - Par, our waiter. Perfect. \n\nI only really got a little taste of this place but it is definitely enough to get me to come back for a full experience. I arrived seeking a group of friends who already had a reservation. We were a large group for the place but all of our servers and waiters were amazing. Especially Par; he was funny, encouraging, accommodating, and entertaining. \n\nThere were plenty of appetizers ordered for the table. A few of the ones I got to sample were the very savory chicken oysters, and the smoky mac and cheese. I know there were more but they were all delicious! I also had the Midnight Gaucho cocktail which was tasty and strong!\n\nThis was the first stop of many that night and it really started the night off right! I will definitely be back to try more of their delicious food and drinks. The ambiance was also something I really liked - classy and classic.\n\n\n\n\n\nCould have been great but not. Took 25 minutes to get the first incorrect cocktail and another 10 to get the second and then a manager to get the correct very simple gimlet to the table. Bibb salad was excellent. Cod was rubbery over cocked and not tasteful.  Service was subpar and unapologetic . Won't be coming back anytime soon\n\n\n\n\n\nGod I love this place! Old school cocktails, beautifully prepared and tasty food and the perfect Old Town Scottsdale Location. Eat at the bar and watch the masters of mixology at work. You're seriously going to think you're in San Francisco when you dine at this gem!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place!!\nAbsolutely Amazing appetizers & ambience! Service is great & staff is friendly!\nOne thing is entrees are not as incredible as appetizers\nTotally recommend this place\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving been warned about what to expect in Old Town Scottsdale, was completely taken aback to find The House, more Southern Charm and less Jersey Shore for sure! \n\nPlumpjack wine and fine whiskeys? But of course. Daily foie gras specials? NBD. Velvet wallpaper and candles everywhere? Duh.\n\nHaving visited SUR and PUMP recently in LA (both Vanderpump establishments), they should pay The House a visit for some tips on decorating and customer service. The House is more than a facade, they actually care about the customers - every customer, not just the \"famous\" ones. \n\nOn Monday evening, the foie special was a gluttonous dessert dish of Brioche French toast, maple brown sugar butter and a generous piece of fatty duck liver on top. Each bite melted in my mouth. Very well executed.\n\nThe ambiance, the wine, the food make this brasserie tops on my list in Scottsdale. Upscale, but not pretentious. 5-stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nSat outside with another couple and had a great dinner! Little pricey, but the quality of food was good. I love to share plates and this place is great for that!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe took some friends who have not been here. Great food as usual with superb service. Very professional and friendly. The hostesses could use a little class in manners.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting concept from the creators of Zinc and the Mission. I love the Mission and probably rate it my top 5 AZ spots. So, flying into Phoenix to meet 2 colleagues, I'm trying to clean up my gmail account when I find a \"ribbon cutting\" email from The House Brasserie. I'd planned a dinner at Maestro's Ocean Club and cancelled via my GoGo wireless account and re-booked the House, simply based on ownership. (No offense meant to Maestro's---but, I live in So Cal and can go there anytime.)\n\nI read the menu and had my eye set on the Paella. WARNING: The website wasn't current and therefore no paella.\n\nWe opted to try small plates v entrees and perhaps we were steered incorrectly. My favorites were the peel and eat shrimp and the lobster fried rice. I was not impressed with the lobster roll, Berkshire pork belly on kimchee, or the kale salad. (No better kale salad exists than Chelsea's kitchen because they properly massage and cut up the kale.) We also tried the duck confit. It seemed many of the dishes were \"overdone\". I don't mean overcooked, more like too rick with too many sauces and tastes which took away from the actual entree v adding to it\n\nThe positives: We had wonderful service and the ambiance in awesome offering seating inside or outside. It happened to be unseasonably cold, so we opted for inside. \n\nI'll probably go back, especially if the fare is lighter as winter comes and goes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely awesome!! Best meal I've had in a very very long time! Service was incredible, food was ridiculous, even the regular customers were excited to help w reccomendations. Fantastic date night or solo, will be back very soon!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously AMAZING. first off, 5 stars for the service she was so sweet and had wonderful reccomendations pertaining to the menu and drinks. She also gave us the history of the building which was really cool and was just all around one of the best servers ive ever had. \n\nThe food also gets 5 stars. The flavors are unique and complex. You feel as if the chef is in that kitchen cooking every dish to impress you. The pork cake (?) Had the perfect amount of crunch and savory flavor paired with a bitter arugula blend for a contrasting flavor pairing. The buretta was soft and creamy and their pomegranate jam is so delish!!! \n\nThe atmosphere makes you feel as if you are on vacation at a little cafe in france. Its really something else. Cant wait to return for dinner on the patio. An extra kudo for finding out that amazing server we had?? It was her first day out of training. That blew me away!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally upscale food. If you're not interested in trying something new and different then I don't suggest it. However, I really do love the food. I like how its unique and different. The place itself I absolutely love. Sitting outside in the courtyard is the way to go. It's been a while since I've been there but I will most definitely be going back soon enough!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a great dinner in their very nice outdoor patio/garden.  Food was good and our server Richie was fantastic; had great suggestions for food and drinks and elevated the whole experience.  Definitely will be coming back and requesting Richie's section!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been several times and it's one of my favorite spots.  Brunch is amazing.   Wonderful place to have a romantic dinner the patio is cozy ... the entire place is cozy.  I love unique dinning and amazing food. This place top of my list!\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to the house tonight to celebrate my birthday with my girlfriend and our experience was incredible! Our server, Tommy, had great recommendations and really knew about the the menu and even picked out the perfect birthday dessert! The duck confit meatballs, scallops, and brisket were amazing! Jimmy, the manager, came by frequently to make sure everything was going well and after dinner we stopped by the bar for an after dinner drink and Billy created some great cocktails for us! We couldn't have had a better night!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis AZ native found dining outside on a Friday evening in late January fabulous for the ambiance on the patio. Our party of five were seated very comfortably at a round table, with extra elbow room, but not too huge we'd have to shout to be heard. Prices are high, as you would expect in this part of town.  But the food, good sized portions on main meal but skimpy on appetizer and dessert, was outstanding in every category, from the 3 appetizers, red snapper, pork chop, and 3 desserts we shared.  Must try the lavender ice cream...  This is a great place to take someone on a first date, or even a romantic celebration for two. There was another large group just a few feet from us celebrating a birthday and having an awesome time. The noise was not a factor because of the layout of the place. Tim, our waiter, was attentive, recommended selections that we weren't disappointed with in the least and we loved that he played back with our sense of humor. Only negative: one bathroom stall, ladies, and no room to wait except outside the door. Not a big deal for most folks. Otherwise, highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas in the area and saw the great reviews so i had to check it out. Let me just say....awesome place.\n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, the food was delicious, and the decor and feel of the resturant was fantastic. I was a bit nervous that it would be to classy for my casually dressed family, but they had no problem and treated us like royalty.\n\nHighly recommend.  Im excited to try put there sister establishments soon. \n\nKeep doing what your doing!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place to take a date. Sit outside. Not pretentious or overpriced.  It's top notch..highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time diner with the best experience. I was visiting friends in Paradise Valley and the last day we were there we came here for brunch. The outdoor ambiance was posh but still very cozy. I was blown away by the food and bottomless mimosas ; our server made them just the way I like them...lots of champagne and a splash of Orange juice. However, the thing that stood out the most to me was in the beginning when my friend finally joined us and she sat down at the table, placing her purse on the ground next to her and the server came by, with out even asking, and placed a napkin out to set her purse on top of it.\n\nLove this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nCute restaurant with friendly staff. We had drinks and tasty apps but thought it was a pricey experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nChocolate wrapped in velvet rolled up in a Sinatra song. Warm. Soft. Smooth. That's how I felt when I got here. That's how I felt while I ate. That's how I felt after I left. \n\nThe House is home. A place where friends gather. But not to play charades and romp in the rec room. No, this is where they gather for cocktails, where they gather for supper club and ya, maybe even whisper a few secrets about the neighbors.\n\nRemodeled from what I was told is the second-oldest house in Scottsdale, no corners were cut or expense spared in honoring the old home but completely repurposing it to be a restaurant. The massive tree in the back, the inviting patio in the front. The bar. The bathrooms. It's all meticulously planned and well-executed. That patio? Yes. That. Eat your meal there. \n\nAnd what's a house without a good meal coming out of the kitchen. The food was sublime. We dined family style, and that's the way to do it. Just order up a bunch of things and share with friends. Amongst the highlights--the crab legs, the kale salad, and pretty much anything sweet.\n\nIt's hard to describe the food. It can't be placed in one category, so don't try to pigeon hole it. It's a direct message from the chef. He's exploring and inviting you along. Certainly it will continue to be refined, but the bursts of genius were enough for me to see that this place has legs.\n\nCharming but swanky, sexy but simple and down to earth. Bravo.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just wasn't feeling it here.  Maybe I've been spoiled by all of the great restaurants in New Orleans lately.  I'm not sure, but The House Brasserie was a disappointment.  It wasn't bad.  It was better than average.  It just didn't meet the expectation build up.\n\n- The service was good, although if the female server touched me one more time, my wife (on Valentine's Day no less) was going to throw down.\n\n- The space was amazing.  Very cool.  Urban gothic.\n\n- Waiting in the parking lot kind of sucked.\n\n- The charcuterie was a la carte, which bummed me out.  I wanted a traditional charcuterie board with the chef selecting what and how much we receive based on our party size.  The salumi was ok.  The smoked burrata was bad (and I love burrata).  The goat cheese was amazing.\n\n- The chef's prepared seared foie gras was good, but the preparation didn't bring out the best in it.  I'm not sure large slices of corn go with fatty duck liver.\n\n- For my main, I got the veal chop.  Medium rare.  It was overcooked at well.  Not a shred of pink or tenderness.  The crust that wasn't burnt was good, but seriously, dry veal is terrible.\n\n- My wife had the short ribs and mashed potatoes.  It was excellent.  Tender and flavorful.\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic Bar...great ambiance....awesome drinks... Cordial staff.  I tried their cinnamon infused whiskey and their beers and they are fantastic. They have duval on tap!\nI didn't have any food but heard good things about it. \nThe ambiance is incredibly inviting and cozy. They have a nice fireplace in the back patio.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to brunch had the apple pancake was very good.  Wife had the scrambled eggs ( 6 yes 6) were fine. There were no meat choices for sides.  Cost $96 including tip for 4 people, NO BOOZE.  I noticed that some of the wine prices on a per bottle basis were as high as $455++, but high end brands.  I saw some by the glass Chardonnay for $19, $66 per bottle.  I want to try it for dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbiance is great! Group of 9, some came early for a cocktail at the bar. Cheerful and attentive service there. When all arrived we were seated at a long table near the back. This is when things went south. Service was disorganized. Friend waited 30 minutes for a glass of wine while another was served 2 drinks in that time. Wine list is limited, overweighted with Chardonnay, and they didn't have wines that were on their list. Food was overall good. I agree with another reviewer to stick to the simpler items. My faves were the Mac and cheese, brisket and biscuit, fingerling potatoes.. and I'm a protein lover. Seared tuna was lost in the busy dish. Smoked burratta was bland. Brussel sprout Caesar salad was good. Blue berry hill cocktail was very good. Sounds weird but try it. Overall food quality was very good as expected, but table service was surprisingly disappointing and the main reason for the 3 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nTook my girlfriend here and was not disappointed. Staff showed an immense amount service. Establishment has an exceptional atmosphere and is even better under the night sky. I ordered the lamb bolognese and a kale salad. Both dishes were very good and hopefully on some other special occasion I will return.\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 birthday reservation on a weekday, we get there at 7:15 and the hostess asks us to wait. Really?  As I walked to the restroom, there were plenty of open tables.  They must be preparing for a nice bday surprise was my guess ... Nope. When we were seated our server asks if we were celebrating a special occasion. Why the need to ask when that was noted in the online reservation? Pointless!!\n\nThe food was all really salty, I should've sent it back but hubby didn't seem to mind as he finished everything after I took a few bites.  They did bring me a birthday pudding which was nice but it still doesn't change the fact the food was subpar.  Disappointing since French is my favorite cuisine. Guess any place would have a hard time standing up against Bouchon in Beverly Hills, CA. \n\nLoved the ambiance, romantic with a touch of rustic. Our server was friendly but hard to track down at times, and left us waiting a while for the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe arrived to the quaint little street just past Old Town and it was immediately charming, lined with attractive businesses and lit by the glow of twinkling lights strung across the lane, with the retro-awesomeness of Valley Ho looming at the end of the street. The parking scenario is not pleasant -there was a  vacant,ghetto-ish valet stand propped haphazardly out into the street. We did a quick driveby just in case regular parking became evident elsewhere, but eventually gave up and returned to valet. It was difficult to tell where we needed to pull up, and then we waited a significant amount of time before finally being greeted by the valet. The valet himself was curt and unfriendly, and when we returned at the end of the night we once again had to wait an interminable amount of time before we were finally able to get our car. Anyway, we meandered past the lovely garden to the hostess stand, where we were greeted and advised that there would be a wait for a patio table. We're not typically picky about where we sit, so we suggested we'd sit inside if they had tables ready? They did, so we did. \n\nAfter being seated on a banquette at a 4-top table in close proximity to other diners, our server swung by to say hello. It was pretty obvious from the outset that our server was new - she just didn't quite have the polish that the setting (and prices) set the stage for. She gave us a very short explanation of the restaurant (second oldest house in Scottsdale) and took drink orders. We picked up a little bit more information from the server taking care of the table beside ours, who animatedly launched into a detailed description of some of the history and the concept of the restaurant. It sounded interesting!\n\nOur appetizers came out very quickly : I had just quietly commented to my husband that it made me sad that nice restaurants which are at least slightly French-influenced don't send amuse bouches anymore when ta-da! Out came an Amuse Bouche from the Chef: Cheese Puffs that were delicious. It was very nice and obviously I had to eat my words :) BUT it was weird that they came out after we had recieved and started on our appetizer - it was the first of some strange pacing issues during our visit. amuse bouche = yummy. Now, back to the appetizers! The House Brisket was generally tasty, although the temperature was cold (how is that possible? We had just ordered and it came out so quickly!) and they were difficult to eat - the portions weren't single bites, but they were tough to cut into and divide into smaller bites as everything just sortof pulled apart. The meatballs: When I think duck confit, I think juicy, fatty and flavor packed deliciousness. These were a bit dry, and the sauce was very thin and difficult to sop up to offset the dryness. They tasted okay but were generally a bit disappointing. \n\nEntrees: My Filet was alright - it was cooked to temperature (medium) properly and the accompanying sauce had nice flavor. The corn on the plate seemed like a bit of a throwaway; I always enjoy sweet corn in summer dishes, but this seemed to just be a filler. My husband's braised pork was amazing - the accompanying apple and grits were just perfect and it was one of my favorite parts of the meal. The Basil and Brie Smashed Potatoes were also a let down - the potatoes themselves were very basic fingerling potatoes with little to no flavor, and they were just smashed a little (I was expecting something a bit more mashed or perhaps crispy) Admittedly, Brie is not my favorite and so I avoided that element of the dish, so perhaps I was missing out on the most important flavor component..\n\nMy dessert was delightful - a pear (or apple? I'm pretty sure it was pear) upside down cake that was just so tasty. I'd go back just for that. My husband's chocolate banana budino was okay, but not super exciting. There didn't seem to be any banana to speak of, so it was basically a quality chocolate pudding. \n\nI had mentioned pacing, our food came out so incredibly quickly, we were actually in and out of the restaurant with three courses in an hour and 15 minutes. I feel a little strange complaining about getting our food quickly, but it just seemed rushed, first with the amuse bouche and appetizers at the same time, and then followed by the rest of the courses hitting us so quickly one after the other. It is the sort of meal you want to linger over, but I felt a bit pushed to finish by the way that it was paced.\n\nThe atmosphere was a combination of nice and not-so-nice. They've done a wonderful job of transitioning the house into a beautifully furnished restaurant. . I didn't love the closeness to the other diners, especially the bachelorette parties in front of and beside us that got rowdier as the night wore on (general screechiness and shot-taking does not make for a romantic evening) The club-like music was out of character for the otherwise upscale and serious setting. \n\nIt was weird, maybe we'll try again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was my second time-- \nOk first- the ambiance warm but there super cool vibe here. First time I ate inside with business colleagues. Second New Year's Eve on the patio.\nThe patio with the lights and heaters made for an amazing NYE.  We started with the steak tartare .. OMG amazing with a romesco sauce and traditional but served with Crinkle cut French fries with a Harissa infused ketchup.  That spice was enough to elevate these fries to another level!\nAsk for extra toast points when you order.\nWe also started with the baked Robiola -a burst of flavor with the crispy artichoke and pistachio! Robiola is like an Italian Brie- not as strong though.\n\nDinner was the small plate of gnocchi with lobster in a broth scented with truffle oil- giant pieces of Maine lobster. Amazing. \nThe special was the rack of lamb.  A large 4 bone rack that melted in your mouth!!! It should be a regular item on the menu. \n\nAn amazing place with great food, ambiance and service. It won't disappoint!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant is very charming. My boyfriend visited with some friends on a prior occasion and decided to take me here for dinner the other night, and I was happy he did! \nHe ordered brisket and I had grilled salmon; both were delicious. This restaurant is a gem--I'm looking forward to dining on their beautiful patio when the weather warms up.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the location and ambiance. Can't say the chef and I share the same taste for spices. Lots of Harissa and an un-identifiable spice on everything from the filet, the steak tartare and simple salad dressing that I didn't love. \n\nI had the scallops that may have been a tad over-done because they were pretty rubbery. \n\nSkipped dessert but had great service and a wonderful night overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nSweetie and I went for her birthday. Two words. Just go. It's just so different from any other place in Scottsdale. \nMake sure you get a table on the patio as it's like dining in a secret garden. Everything we had was really terrific. Frankly I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. If you can take some time to have a before dinner drink by the fireplace. It's not outrageously expensive if you don't dip into the wine too heavily. Service is super professional and attentive without being snobbish.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharming place, extensive wine list including wines offered by the bottle can also be requested by the glass ( so many good choices !!). I enjoyed the red snapper for dinner and roasted cauliflower. The service was excellent. All staff including the manager were attentive, friendly and social. The restaurant appeared to be short staffed so there were a few minor glitches but overall a delicious and extremely enjoyable dining experience. I would absolutely return!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen wanting to check this place out for sometime, so my roomate and I stopped in for their Sunday brunch. Now I see why the reviews are so good! I had the arugula salad, my friend had an omelette, and we shared the burrata. Sooo good and I cant wait to come back for dinner. The only complaint I had was that our server was a bit pretentious,  but otherwise we really enjoyed the House Brasserie!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is terrific. Same owners as The Mission and Zinc Bistro, so of course you will find terrific ambiance, great and friendly service, and top-notch food, drinks, and wines. You will also likely be greeted by one of the owners personally at some point, and treated like an honored guest. Meanwhile, the hostesses and wait staff will take great care of you.\n\nAs for The House itself, it has a story and a life of its own: it is one of the oldest houses in Scottsdale, and the large pine tree that shades the side dining patio was a Christmas tree planted by a little girl who lived there in like 1940. The integrity and charm of all this  rich history has been thoughtfully retained -- elevated, even -- while the parlor and dining room inside have been artfully transformed into a Parisienne-type setting, like Les Deux Magots, or some other place Hemingway would have hung out in the 1920s.\n\nIt's like a fine Paris brasserie, without any of the snoot, built on a foundation of Scottsdale history and hospitality. Highly recommended!! \n\nIn a town with a lot of top-notch options, this will surely be one of my regular stops!!\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic food and fantastic atmosphere. Took a friend here for their last meal in Old Town and couldn't be happier\n\n\n\n\n\nHad dinner here last night (3 small plates & a salad). I had the duck meatballs, the ham hock dish, brisket biscuit, and butter lettuce salad. It was a great building and the ambiance was really nice. I found all the dishes, except the ham hock dish, to be very under-seasoned. I don't think there was any salt in or on my food. The salad was nothing remarkable - I got excited when I thought there was bacon on it, but later found it was dried beet. While I can see myself returning here for drinks, I doubt that I will go back for a meal (unless I am trying to impress someone with how much I can spend on a meal). On a positive note, the service was pretty good. \n\nAs I was sitting there trying to read the menu, I was surprised that anyone ordered anything at night on the patio. There are next-to no lights outside. I had to use my iPhone to get enough light to read the menu. I even saw waiters using flash lights to show people the items on the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here once when they first opened up and liked it. The hubby and I decided to come here for a romantic date night and we where happy we did. Everything we ordered was fantastic, delicious, and fresh.\nWe first had the lobster gnocchi...WOW!! Big, chunky fresh pieces of lobster mixed in with their home made gnocchi. \nSecond, we had the foie gras. This is the best Foie Gras I have tasted so far. The serving was only 1oz, but worth every succulent bite. I was not a fan of the sauce they added on the side. I like the Foie Gras flavors to shine through.\nLastly, we ordered the Filet with Brabb. Yumm Yumm Yumm!!\nI cannot wait to come back and try more of their delicious plates on the menu.\n\nThank you!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand new. Stumbled into it Excellent execution on all plates. Roasted halibut, roasted broccoli soup, nice choices for charcuterie plate and interesting texture for shrimp and grits. Highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here last night for my fianc's birthday. The steak tartare appetizer and Brussel sprouts we started with, they were both delicious and light starters. I had the salmon and he had the pork chop. Both very good and cooked perfectly. Wish it was cooler to sit outside because it looked so pretty. Finished with a fantastic bday dessert with raspberries, panna cotta and home made toffee. Only complaint was the primarita drink we wasn't too good.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here for dinner with a work colleague while in town for the week.\nPros:\n1. Reservations were easy on open table. \n2. Ambiance was nice. This would be a good place for dates. Temperatures was perfect outside. \n3. Food was pretty good. I ordered the chicken and coworker ordered some veggie pasta. Portions were also a good size. Not skimpy like you would expect. \n4. Decent wine collection. \n\nCould be improved:\n1. Reservations were at 715 and we arrived at 645. So we checked in early , asked to get seated if there was a table and waited at the bar. 40 mins go by and finally we are seated. Now normally this wouldn't bother me the slightest bit but the restaurant was 50% full. Not sure why they made us wait for so long? \n2. I don't know if this is a thing in Arizona but why can they not combine the bar tab with the meal tab? Ok if it's a bar bar I can understand. People gotta get their tips but this is a nice place. Was just weird how we had to pay the bill twice. \n\nOverall good experience though. Would definitely come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing food, atmosphere and staff!!! A wonderful experience and I will be back every time I visit the Scottsdale area!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a magical place to enjoy my very first dinner in Scottsdale! Fellas, if you're looking for a place to DAZZLE your lady, look no further than The House!\n\nI came into town for a work retreat and was completely taken aback by the tranquil beauty of the property and outdoor patio. We were seated outside and enjoyed a beautiful meal under the stars. Months later my head is still spinning from course after course after course which stuffed us til we were barely able to walk!\n\nThe owner came by and told us that The House is one of the oldest homes in Old Town and I loved all the wonderful stories he told us about the property. Be sure to take a walk around the property and you'll see that the renovations have blended together the historic charm of the property with contemporary accents.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner here.  This restaurant made my night so special and memorable.  Not only was the food amazing (SERIOUSLY AMAZING), the staff was beyond attentive, helpful, and funny!  I can't speak highly enough about this place... although I might be a little biased since I had such an amazing night here with my boyfriend.\n\n\n\n\n\nOld fashioned and manhattan were both delicious and boozy.  Sat at the bar. Ambience both inside and outside were fantastic.  Trees around you and lots of hanging lights.  Inside reminded me of back east 1950s; very elegant and classic.  Service was fantastic as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never heard of this place before and found it on Google Maps. I thought it looked interesting based on previous reviews.\n\nAMBIENCE: The interior was quaint and cozy with excellent subdued lighting, mirrors, candles, etc. and the exterior had some great tables, too. However, we were seated at a table right in front of the kitchen pick up window which had an extremely bright light pointed directly into my eyes. I didn't mind having to wait for a table and at that time, a bunch of other tables opened up minutes after we were seated. I would have preferred a smaller table with at least a candle and would have waited a few more minutes for it.\n\nSERVICE: Our server was very friendly and sweet. I just thought it was odd that she suggested that we order everything at once because big parties would be arriving soon and she didn't want us to wait too long. Huh? And we weren't always asked if we were finished when plates were cleared so it was laughable that we were asked if we wanted more bread only to have 2 small ovals of pretzel bread brought to the table after our plates were gone. While we did order everything at once, we were asked if we were ready for the next round. Ok, what happened to tell me everything you want now so the kitchen won't be overloaded?\n\nFOOD: Our first impression was that we were taken aback by the strange flavor combinations and loose interpretations. The White Bean Gruyere Fondue was more like a shmear with hardly any detectable cheese and yes, it was melted but don't except a pot of melted cheese, which is really what a fondue is vs. what it means. Semantics. The Duck Confit Meatballs were tangy, a little dry, but kind of lost their flavor by being overpowered by the Agridolce. The Dr. Pepper Ham Hock Poutine was definitely NOT a poutine. I guess the Canadian chef wasn't working that night because ours didn't have any cheese curds. Oh, and the potatoes were like Ore-Ida crinkle cut fries. The star was the Foie Gras: perfectly cooked and seasoned. I'm glad we only had appetizers to try out this place as the entrees are really expensive. I got a look at the sea scallops coming out of the kitchen: 3 for $28, methinks not. I can get 2 dozen from Whole Foods for the same price.\n\nWhile not 5-star, I prefer the more rustic and more reasonably-priced French food of Petite Maison, also in Scottsdale.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food, ambiance and service. Oh and don't forget the cocktails. Really enjoyed the beef brisket biscuit and the jerk chicken. Kale salad was tasty too. My only complaint is on the cheese plate, the piece of cheese + bread was pricey for the amount you receive. Our waitress was wonderful and I'm sorry I don't remember her name. She gave great suggestions and spaced our food delivery out wonderfully. Will go back soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI hosted a bridal shower brunch for my friend here and it was a wonderful experience.  The staff made the entire event incredibly easy to plan and they went out of their way to make it a special day for my friend.  Everyone loved the food and the atmosphere and the prices were very reasonable for what you got.  Thanks again!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for my BF's birthday, and everything from the ambiance to the service to the food was nothing short of amazing. We had the smoked manhattans with the crispy chicken thighs (amazing also) and they are so good. The twist of the smoke with the cherry coke was delicious and unexpected. We loved them. We then switched to wine, which the waiter recommended a bottle and it was awesome (again!). My bf had the lamb and they were cooked so well, so tender and juicy. I had the Halibut, so good! the veggies on the plate and the mushrooms were so well done. We then ended with complimentary dessert which was unreal- Whipped Ricotta and Poppy seed with sweet berry compote. YUM! Just go here - everything is so well done, you can't be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo my girlfriend and I decided to go out for girls night and check out this new spot for dinner. We had no idea what to expect as we had never seen the place before, but we knew it had to be good if it was anything like the mission. Well it was so much more than that! It was the cutest little place set in an old historic house with a charming candelight patio and the hugest tree I had ever seen sprawling over the place! \n\nWe were greated and told a bit about the menu and drinks after we were sat outside in front of the lovely old fireplace. I chose the watermelon cooler and my friend went with a margarita of some kind. OMG those drinks were to die for!!! the watermelon cooler was so so good and I could have drank that all night! We then decided to share a few things for small plates. We ordered the brisket biscut which just melted in your mouth and was packed with flavor! We then had the crab dip which was absolutely delicious and creamy and the bread was toasted to perfection. Then our absolute favorite was the duck confit meatballs. These were thee best meatballs ever! Crispy on the outside soft on the inside and there was a serious explosion of flavors that I cannot even describe!\n\nIt was so good we went for brunch the next day and let me tell you that was amazing as well. Do yourself a favor and treat your palate at the House Brasserie!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally Good Food! Plain a simple. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Great service, great specials.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service and menu. We were especially drawn to the atmosphere and history behind the house. If you haven't been yet it's highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways great service and delicious food! The bartenders here are TRUE mixologists!\n\nHeather and Tommy are both incredible servers, knowledgable of the cocktail, wine and food menus. They will never hesitate to acquiesce any request, and they are sincerely two of the funniest servers that I have ever met. I enjoy every time I come to The House and they take care of me!\n\nFYI- Steak tartare, foie gras, and scallops are incredible.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame to dinner here based on the yelp reviews. Where do I start? The short rib entre had one rib. One. The extra rare filet was cooked medium. The food in general was mediocre at best. The best part of the meal was the coffee. Oh and the men's restroom floor was so slippery that all the members of the party that went to the restroom almost fell. For one hundred dollars per head I expect much much better.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver rated beyond belief!!\nThe restaurant setting is unique in its cozy ambiance, but you pay $250 for two to eat good food not the ambiance. Our 30th anniversary, as a visitor to Phoenix, was not something to be stamped out in our culinary diary as \"outstanding\". The staff has been trained to \"sell\" the \"Goods\", but the Goods' are not there to be sold. Upon our arrival, we were given the privilege of being seated in the patio area, provided we vacated the table in \"one hour forty minutes\"!! Our server was very accommodating, well informed and courteous, but the kitchen did not take any notice of his recommendations and most of our food had to be returned for revision. The menu is structured around the fancy names, extravagant ingredients and presentation, but the quality and the \"yummy factor\" is just not there to match the intentions. My wife's orders had to be modified due to her numerous allegories, so in the spirit of fairness, I will only comment on my choices which were presented exactly as described on the menu. The lobster appetizer starter, with a fancy name ($18) turned out to be a few pieces of tasteless lobster meat in some kind of equally tasteless sauce buried in an unimpressive French Bread and accompanied with soggy and limp French Fries. The main course, the stake ($38+) was a lump of un-seasoned meat on a pile of fiery hot chilies and corn (out of a can), with a failed attempt to camouflage the tasteless meat. The reprieve came at the end of the meal. The desert and espresso was well presented and very tasty. \nIf you are seeking bragging rights for a night out, this is your place. On the other hand if you are after good food, look for an establishment serving a true gourmet product.\nFred Fardoost\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways a stress eliminator going to The House.  I've been to The House a couple times now, for dinner and brunch.  It's now my favorite restaurant in Old Town.  One just feels taken care of there.  The ambiance is comfortable and classicly elegant, every one of the staff act like they just genuinely want you to enjoy your time there.  The menu isn't intimidating but is still elegant and fun at the same time, and the food and wine are all excellent.  \n\nWe still haven't tried the patio, but I'm looking forward to that as soon as the weather allows.\n\nIt is fairly expensive for dinner, but their brunch is a great value.  Brunch entrees are roughly $15 a plate, they have $15 bottomless mimosas and HALF OFF all bottles of wine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place really hit the spot! My girlfriend and I yelped it and were not disappointed by the 4.5 star review. \n\nWe tried 4 appetizers. The Udon noodle and Biscuit brisket w white cheddar were tops. Food was outstanding. \n\nThe service, decor, ambiance, and quality were all top notch. The best part of all? The drink menu. Try em all!\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Brasserie, you're such a flirt. You weren't even modest about it, you flaunted that sensuality before I reached for the door, tarted up in your tinkling necklace of lights and gown of vine. I have to admit, I was smitten. For a dame of such established pedigree (I hear you're the second eldest home in all of Scottsdale), you're Rita Hayworth, Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly wrapped in kale and orecchiette: divine.\n\nYou titillated me with your silken, endlessly long crab legs, lime buttered above the heel. I wanted to peel and eat your spicy shrimp, but that would've been a little too adventurous for a first date, so I... chowed down. Immediately I cooled my fiery palate with your amazing kale salad, something we both agreed was both delectable and smart from a dietary perspective. But oh, how our sensibilities were fast to wane as you prepared cocktail after fabulous cocktail...\n\nYour Chateau Briand, oh my! Delectable. Lobster Friend Rice: it's an Asian fusion love affair! Broccoli Carbonarra: you have me at your doorstep. Marinated Jidori Chicken: I'm swimming in your silk sheets. So get it over with already, Brasserie. Take me.\n\nYou did. I feel like such a floozy. Your crumb cake and sacher torte made me your slave. I'm done. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I feel used.\n\nAnd I WANT MORE.\n\nDon't get me started on your wallpaper...\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent. Had brunch here today with friends, the house turkey sandwich is great. 4 people, 1 bottle of champagne and orange juice for $70, great deal. And the hugh tent over the patio is nice, covers about 50 people. Will be back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter trying to get a table at \"The Misson\" it was suggested we try \"The House,\" their sister restaurant several blocks away. Wow! What an incredible waste of $200!  The only saving grace was the company of great friends that we hadn't seen in four years.  The atmosphere and service was excellent, which is why I feel it deserves at least one star.  The food? After all the rave reviews I'm thinking maybe the executive chef had the evening off.......\n\nFor starters we shared:\nBerkshire Pork Belly\nDuck Confit Meatballs w/ Foie Gras\nBone Marrow \nWe could have skipped all of these!\n\nDinner:\nLamb Bolognese, ok, but tasted no mint, lemon or marscapone\nSeared Diver Scallops, of which there were three \nRoasted Jidori Chicken, so dry it turned to sawdust in your mouth - yuk!\nBerkshire Pork Ribs, the only thing that was plentiful and tasty (never mind one side of the rib was undercooked!)\n\nAll the fancy buzz words used to describe the dishes on the menu I think were there to impress as almost everything was truly one-dimensional and underwhelming!  The loud overhead, hip-hop music was so inappropriate - you would think in a cozy, romantic, intimate environment the selection would be a little more subdued.\n\nNever again!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an awesome gem right in Old Town!  It is located in an hold house.  The inside is very elegant.  I've eaten here twice. Once for brunch and once for dinner.  For brunch I had an outstanding homemade crepe.  For dinner,   I ate the brisket and biscuit and it was A+!   One of my new fav places!  The also have a large patio seating area!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning! Had the foie grass dish. Worst ever. Do not order this. Asked to have it redone and they brought the same platter. Do not order. This is junk.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped by House Brasserie for dinner during my sister's bachelorette in Scottsdale. The restaurant decor is absolutely beautiful. The staff is friendly and the service was great. Everything on the menu looked great - we asked our waiter for advice on what to order - and he raved about absolutely everything. We ended up trying: the brussel sprouts, the chicken meatballs and gnocchi, the lamb bolognese, the tomahawk pork chop, the skirt steak, and the filet. The food was delicious - well seasoned and flavored. Would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in the Scottsdale area!\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding!  Wonderful food, cocktails, and service!  My husband and I frequently dine and enjoy trying local places and we are so pleased that we came here.  The server was great and when we were seated he was honest and told us we could order cocktails and relax a little so the kitchen could catch up!  We went for a relaxing evening and that definitely started it - he offered great input for various items on the menu based on what we said we like.  The food was top notch - fresh scallops cooked to perfection, and the chicken gidori was delicious.  We shared an upside down cake with pistachio ice-cream, yummy.  All courses were great and the price was very reasonable for the food we received.  The ambiance was cozy and sophisticated.  We highly recommend trying this - we will go back !\n\n\n\n\n\nRenovated and transformed into a restaurant on par with many fine Manhattan eateries, this second oldest house in Scottsdale joins the ranks of CIBO and Arcadia Farm with its warm, inviting ambiance.\nYou're simply taken-in by its intimate decor.\n\nThe staff was cheerful, friendly and highly attentive.\nThe food, superb.\n\nMashed potatoes so silky smooth, you'll wonder how this is even possible as you make the quick comparison to the slop you eat each year at your Aunt Mary's Thanksgiving Dinner table.\n\nPopcorn Grits. \nThis side will make you lose interest in your entree as you feverishly scour the table for a large serving spoon rivaling the size of your mouth fully outstretched.\nI ate this dish so quickly, it was like David Copperfield was in the house!\n\nImported from a mill in Tennessee, the grits are reduced into a risotto-like texture along with kernel corn, crushed popcorn, and a cheese you'll probably never find on the grocer's shelf. These grits are so wonderfully delicious, after the first bite you won't care what's on the dessert menu as you fill up on this heavenly creation.\n\nBetween the mashed potatoes and the grits, I'd eaten more carbs in one sitting than I do in a month.\n\nThe ribeye is served with marrow butter atop its caramelized, dark brown goodness.\nBoth the flavor and the smell will captivate you as you're quickly reminded why it is you're so fond of a good steak. SImply delightful.\nThe House knows its beef.\n\nVisiting The House was a treat I won't soon forget, but sadly, and I think I'm right on this one, the next time I attempt to dine here, they'll have a wait list as long as those fine Manhattan eateries you can never get into.\n\nPS:\nThe large pine tree in the rear yard was actually the family's Christmas tree circa 1943. I looked for carvings, but was informed the family consisted of four daughters so it's highly unlikely any of them had ever received an 'Old Timer' pocket knife from dad on their birthday or Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter trying to get a reservation for a month or so we finally got one!!  6 of us sat outside and celebrated my mom's birthday. The atmosphere was excellent. The hostess was delightful. The bartender was very nice. Our waiter was nice, but a bit over the top. He used several of his \"lines\" on all the tables around us. The chef sent out a little complimentary appetizer that was to die for. We ordered the chicken meatballs, brisket, steak, chicken, pork chop, potatoes and more. Every single dish was delish but sadly, not hot enough. We were all slightly disappointed that the food was not hotter.  We had to ask for dessert menus (after waiting awhile) and the desserts were not nearly as good as the dinner. Stick with appetizers, forget about dessert!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here twice and had great experiences both times. My sister in laws took me here for my bday earlier this year and we had a great girls night here. Fun dishes and drinks in a cozy atmosphere and of course close to old town so plenty of bars nearby for after dinner. Second time came here just sat at the bar for drinks and they had a good selection and the bar tender was able to make some speciality drinks for us\n\n\n\n\n\nI was really looking forward to my lunch date with The House, after all I love the Mission.  However, our meals really lacked WOW factor-- for the prices it should be impressive.  In a group of six no one ooooed or awwwed over the meal and one had to be sent back.   We had the lemon curd cake but the blackberries were to seedy and affected the overall texture of the cake. The apple upside down cake was better but not amazing.  Our service was average and then they ran the wrong amount on the credit cards so it took a bit of fixing on the tab. Not sure, if I will do a dinner date at these prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nCool feelings about this spot the food smells great! Turns out the chicken dish my wife had was so good it made me order another! Very tasty dish.....\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to \"The House\" when they first opened. We walked from my girlfriend's house~ (what joy to be so close!) We sat on the beautiful patio. Our server Luis was amazing, attentive and professional.  We shared everything. We started with the burrata which Luis split for us at the table with a history of how it is made. We then shared a steak that was also cut and split by our server. Delicious.The owner came by to ask how everything was, a very nice touch. I found myself with nothing to do on Christmas Eve. I stopped by The House. I \"checked in\" on Facebook. On recommendation I had the newly added tomato soup. Amazing, great presentation and with beautiful roasted corn to add texture. Two friends showed up! With their well-behaved dog so we moved to the patio- there I had the duck confit sandwich and the manager Sal came by an recommended a glass of the the Bell Glos (sp?) which knocked my socks off. We were also treated to a sample of the house-made cinnamon whiskey, which was excellent. My friends had to leave, I moved back to the bar for the cinnamon cake (marvelous) and coffee. I felt  guilty that the coffee is so labor intensive but SO worth it, and the staff wasn't too busy- this was the best cup of coffee I've ever had . Everything was so wonderful and I cannot wait to go back again! I think what chef Matt Carter does best is created \"cravable\" foods- thing you can't stop thinking about and want to go back for. He does it well.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh my gosh!!!!! I love this place! I came to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and was blown away with this gem! A house transformed into a romantic escape! I am obsessed with this place! I have always wanted to come here! \n\nThe service was very fast, friendly, and 'on point'! Our wine was perfectly paired and all the suggested plates we tried and loved! \nBesides the celebration of my boyfriends birthday he ended up proposing!!!! Even a better moment! The night kept getting better! \nI'm so happy he proposed here as it is now my new favorite place to go! Our night couldn't have been more perfect! Many thanks to the wonderful staff!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried this restaurant a couple of weeks ago with two friends. When we made reservations, we were asked if there were any dietary considerations and we replied that one of us was a vegetarian. \"No problem\" we were told and the dietary concern was brought up by staff when we arrived, so they clearly had documented it.\n\nNow for the pros:\n\nit is a lovely, warm space and the service was wonderful. At the risk of sounding like an old fart (I'm in my 40s), some well known restaurants in the area hire very young staff and do not train them in service. Any one can take an order and carry dishes to the table. Not everyone understands that this isn't where good service ends. Our waiter was amiable, available and clearly knew the menu well.\n\nThe food was ambitious but approachable. The portions are small, but ya know what? Most US restaurants serve way too much food. The smaller portions make it easier to try several things and not leave feeling like the proverbial stuffed turkey.\n\nThe cons: pretty much the choices for vegetarians. I have eaten with this vegetarian friend at many many local restaurants. A good chef will be creative and that doesn't mean serving you a pasta primavera or risotto. They will create something. My friend prefers to eat lighter on the carbs and is honestly happy with a selection of side dishes. You won't believe what she was served as her entree: a VERY small plate of kale and brocolli. That's it. When the check arrived, she was billed $6 which is the price for the side dishes. Did anyone possibly think that even a small woman might not find that a saucer sized plate enough to eat for dinner? We actually went to Taco Bell on the way home (a running joke amongst us, despite being foodies, we appreciate the lure of late night Taco Bell). Frankly I was aghast and seriously thought something else would be coming out. I suspect that either the Chef was not in attendance and the decision about what to serve her was left to the line cooks, or the Chef simply cannot think outside of the box or pigeonholes all vegetarians into the \"stir fried carrots/brocolli/zucc\" or pasta primavera category. Really, there are more creative options out there.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant is amazing! Perfect for happy hour, dinner, dessert and coffee, or really any reason to go out. We sat outside on the patio and even though still chilly, the atmosphere and the service made us quickly forget it. The menu is unforgettable - crab fondue, brisket biscuits, popcorn grits, scallops, lamb bolognese, and of course the apple upsidedown cake with pistachio ice cream! Definitely going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely the number 1 restaurant in Scottsdale for variety, flavor, service and ambiance!  We had the duck meatballs for appetizer, I had Scallops and my date ordered the Lamb.  All prepared with wonderful flavor!  Dessert we had the pineapple/caramel/pasticcio upside cake~~amazing! Their coffee is prepared table side in an aerated glass flask, fresh ground.  A real treat to experience.   We sat outside by the big fire place under the HUGE Pine tree, music was low an easy listening.  Our server, Ann, was a delight!  EVERY employee conducted themselves in a happy, professional manner & all sharped dressed in black.  Congratulations to Brian, owner, for another 1st class restaurant!\n\n\n\n\n\nJust had dinner here tonite.  We also had dinner there 10 days ago.  Maybe we should have thought twice and went to another place but the ambience is so nice and on a gorgeous nite here....why not.  I know why not.  We had the mall plate of meatballs and gnocchi....mediocre at best.  I don't know what seasoning they used in the sauce, but my Italian relatives would be modified.  I had the pork belly and it was good, a bit dried out, but it's what they put with it, that was a total turn off.  Cabbage was not good and they had some fronds of the fennel, with hardly any fennel, and some mini mystery vegetable.  There was no taste to any of the veggies.  Husband had the duck both times and enjoyed it.  The fist was the choice of our friends.  They enjoyed it, but didn't like the lentil under the fish.  The prices might be a bit high for very small portions.  The thought of Brussel sprout salad sounded enticing but the taste wasn't exciting....lacked any definition of flavor or seasoning.  Quite boring! The restaurant is OK, but not a rush-to-go-back type of place!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first impression of the House Brasserie was a disappointment. My boyfriend had made reservations several weeks in advance as a surprise Valentine's day gift to me. The reservations were confirmed  for 8:45 via Opentable. Then a voicemail was received confirming the same time but we would need to be out of the restaurant by 10:30 as the table was needed for another reservation. At 5:50, a text was received confirming 5:45 reservation time. My boyfriend called the restaurant ask about the mixup only to be told in a condescending voice that they would TRY to accommodate the 8:45 time slot. My upset boyfriend was left with the impression that the restaurant was trying to coerce him into canceling his reservation so someone else could take our place instead. This is just poor form for a restaurant that is supposed to be such a fabulous place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was our second visit....it might be our last.   Our first experience was excellent and we planned on taking our family here for Christmas after raving about it.  \n\nThe second visit was mediocre.   Service was spotty -- possibly because we were having an early dinner?   Timing for our food was problematic and the overall meals were under seasoned and just not anything special.   \n\nWhat is so frustrating is that our first experience was so good and now...I don't know what.  It certainly didn't feel like it was worth the $400 for the 5 of us.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, I went on Saturday night, tried to sit at the bar, but the seats were so tight there was no way one could be comfortable.  On top of it, the bartender spent about 5+ minutes chatting with someone who came up AFTER I sat down, completely ignored me.  I got up and walked out.  Too bad as it came recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\ni was looking for a comfortable yet delicious place to take the boyfriend for his birthday and the friend recommended the house. i'm soooo glad that we came here! not only is it ridiculously charming and romantic, this place can seriously serve up some delicious dishes!\n\nfor starters we had the berkshire pork belly with kimchee/udon noodles/fried egg as well as the steak tartare with fries dusted with a spice rub and avocado mousse. the pork belly was super tender and juicy with a bit of sweetness which perfectly offset the vinegar tinge of the kimchee. i loved the udon and i'm a sucker for a fried egg on top of anything so i was in heaven. the steak tartare was prepared perfectly with a great citrus taste that worked with the avocado mousse. the fries kicked ass. i mean, c'mon, who doesn't love fries?\n\nthe waiter was extremely attentive and had a whole host of great recommendations when it came to the entrees and drinks. we ordered the seared diver scallops and the pork country rib. let me warn you, the portion on the pork country rib is HUGE. i wasn't even able to finish half of it and took it home (which made a badass breakfast in the morning). the seared diver scallops were buttery and melted in your mouth. \n\nwe topped off dinner with the apple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream. holy crap that was freaking great! the perfect end to a perfect meal.\n\nthank you, the house brasserie, for making my boyfriend's dinner fantastic and extremely enjoyable. we will definitely be back for dinner and will have to check out brunch on your dog friendly patio :).\n\n\n\n\n\nSame owners as The Mission, same brilliantly executed overall customer experience.\n\nYou have a good chance of meeting the GM or owner while here. Waitresses are super attentive and wear fun, matching dresses. \n\nYou'll notice every dish is planned to nail more than one flavor experience. Something rich accompanied by something that cuts through it, which I TOTALLY appreciate: house braised brisket w/ white cheddar, then chili jam to cut thru... rich pork belly/ udon noodles, then housemade kimchi to cut thru... etc.\n\nTypically don't like French food, but I imagine this is the best place for it. Super inventive, cutting-edge menu. Loved the duck bahn mi with housemade kimchi. Black kale salad with pepitas (same pepitas I noticed from The Mission's OUTSTANDING tableside guac) and peppercorn dressing was perfect for brunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lamb ragu pasta will ruin any pasta I ever order. The meatballs with fois gras was amazing. Overall, our whole meal was perfect. \nThe service was also the best I have ever had.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hitting up The Mission (and loving it) and being told about this sister restaurant, we decided to check it out on our last night in Scottsdale. It was delicious, the service was excellent and I definitely recommend it although I do like The Mission better.\n\nThe star dish of the night was the halibut. Amazing. Hubby ordered it and I was kicking myself for not getting it too. It had the perfect balance of textures and flavors. The halibut was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy sear on the outside. Underneath was a blend of all sorts of things - clams, beans, greens, and the plate was drizzled with balsamic syrup (or something similar) and topped with fried capers. All the flavors really worked together - little bit of sweet, salty, briny, vinegary. It was the best dish we ordered. The duck confit meatballs with fois gras I ordered were good but the fois gras flavor got lost in the sweet and sour sauce. And I wish there was more white bean pure underneath because it was so delicious. I also got the date and arugula salad with Gorgonzola. It was ok, but nothing special. The duck confit buns were delicious and spicy. Too spicy for my 5 year old and I wish our server had told us that there would be a spicy sauce on it otherwise we wouldn't have ordered it for him. He couldn't finish them, so hubby and I did. Our server made up for it by comping us a dessert which was very thoughtful. We ordered our son a side of krinkle fries which were excellent. We also ordered the homemade sweet butter and bread. The butter was divine, it just melted in your mouth and tasted so good spread on the variety of breads offered. My favorite bread was the olive and walnut. Hubby also ordered a side of potatoes with melted Brie and pesto. He loved it, I thought it was just ok. Not my flavor profile and the potatoes were soft, not crisp.\n\nDesserts were just ok. There were only 3 to choose from: chocolate bandino with homemade marshmallow and salted peanuts, buttermilk blueberry crumb cake, and an apple almond cake with pistachio ice cream. We ended up ordering 2 chocolate bandino's, and 1 apple almond cake. The chocolate bandino (basically a thick chocolate pudding) was way too sweet. And the marshmallow put the sweetness over the top. I needed a salted peanut in every bite to balance how sweet it was but you only got maybe 5 peanuts. My son didn't like it at all (and it's chocolate!). The apple almond cake was on the house (prob because of the duck confit buns that were too spicy for my son) and I thought it was just ok as well. There was just nothing special about it that stood out. I thought it was overly sweet as well. The desserts we ordered had no balance of flavors. Everything was just sweet, sweet and more sweet. I should have ordered the buttermilk blueberry crumb cake! Maybe that would have been more promising.\n\nThere were many other items on the menu that I wanted to try. I definitely recommend this place. The quality of ingredients were superb and there were a variety of items on the menu to order. Our server was excellent overall. He chatted with us, was very attentive and gave us his recommendations. \n\nIf you are ever in Scottsdale, check out The Mission first, then come here for a more upscale french influenced meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the cocktails, to the appetizers, to the main course!  This place will make you feel at home (no pun intended) and make you want to come back.  Service is phenomenal and the price is totally in range.  Bartenders keep it lively so feel free to go in for just drinks too.  The recipes they come up with are simply awesome!  Will be back again soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know when you order wrong and you're super jealous of what the other person orders?  That's me with this place.  I am super jealous of my other person's kale and salmon salad.  Dang it!  I'm totally going back and getting it.\n\nI personally got the pork medallion salad with arugula and it was delicious.  Perhaps I should've checked to see that the pork served was deep fried and changed my mind, but honestly the salad was delicious.\n\nNow we were not there during happy hour and you *pay* for your drinks otherwise. ;)  But the sangria was outstanding nonetheless.  \n\nThe patio is adorable, chic, quaint, romantic, cozy.. all those words. ;)  It's not super pretentious however.  \n\nI'm eager to return, get that damn salad and go during happy hour so I don't end up with a $50 lunch (35 of that was booze, baby)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant simply rocks. I've been there three times for dinner and each time I'm wowed all over again.\n\nService each time has been exceptional, with food so perfectly done that I couldn't imagine any improvements to be made.\n\nI recommend the pork, the lamb bolognese, and of course the chicken. \n\nThe only negative thing I can say is one that I can't say for sure, and that is what happens when the weather gets hot out! The outdoor space is inviting, and simply delightful, but they haven't been open in the heat of the summer. I hope they come up with something because I can't imagine not going there all year long!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place blew me away. I'm a huge fan of The Mission and didn't anticipate that the food would be as good as it is. The staff was excellent. Try the house made whiskey. It tastes nothing like whiskey and is amazing! Brian and Matt have done it again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beginning was rough. Bad time of day to find parking. Had a reservation for inside but our table wasn't ready and had to sit outside. Don't get me wrong it was a super nice night to be sitting outside and they have a great patio but our chairs were wet from the downpour. If I were a witch, I'd have melted. \nWant to get hammered? Order a mai Thai. Super strong. \nGreat wine menu. \nStarted with the foie gras. It was a nice change of pace from where we started. So delectable. And great presentation. \nThe duck with handmade pasta was good for a classic dish but it didn't wow me. My partners veal chop on the other hand was wowable and well seasoned. His Mac and cheese was packed with flavor and had a nice crispy top. \nThe blueberry Mochi was a superb finisher. Their ice cream comes from sweet republic which sold me immediately.\nOur server Chelsea was awesome. Gave good recommendations and told us the history of the neighborhood cat Kane. Any place that feeds a stray is an immediate favorite.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe happened to park out front of the restaurant on our first ever trip to Scottsdale and it had been open only two weeks.  We went in because the chalkboard out front had listed some of our favorite Oregon  cheeses on it.  We were extremely impressed they had lobster rolls (random, and thank  you) we ordered the pastrami sand. very tender, very flavorful, a cheese plate, the lobster fried rice, the chicken parm. sand. but the stand out for me was the fries with the pork hock and gruyere, i wasn't expecting much, but the flavor was just excellent.  We'll be back when we get back to Scottsdale -  the drinks, they needed just a little more life - little more flavor, but they get a pass, the food gets the 5 stars all day\n\n\n\n\n\nWonderful meal!  Very friendly, approachable and knowledgeable staff made our night even more enjoyable.  We started at the bar with a cocktail and the charcuterie sampler before moving into the dining room for our dinner.  Both salads we had were very tasty (the Brussel Sprout Salad edged out the Black Kale Salad in my opinion) as well as all three meals we ordered (Lamb Ragout, Diver Scallops and Filet).  While I didn't have the Irish Coffee, the people I were with raved about it.  \n\nCompared to Zinc Bistro, their sister restaurant, The House Brasserie was considerably better!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a large party This past weekend there and they totally took advantage of us . We told the waiter we wanted to share some things and do a tasting type of menu ... He proceeded to bring at least one Appetizer and one entree for every guest - $2k later we walked out of there with sticker shock- some of the dishes like the chicken and duck entrees were good, the steak was overcooked and not close to the value of the price they were Charging - none of the 16 in our party will be back\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this little neighborhood joint. The bartenders are expert mixologists, and the chef is always creating awesome presentations. The patio and side garden are wonderful in the cooler months. Note: make a reservation...it is difficult to get a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday dinner seating as a walk up. Also, this is a place for epicureans. If you are not adventurous, this may not be the right place for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nEaten here twice and exquisite each time.  I did not originally intend to order the hamburger for lunch but it was the best I have ever eaten.  Earlier had fish for dinner.   Each instance a superb meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hubby and I decided to try this place for date night.  We are relatively new to town and hit a home run with this restaurant.  When making a reservation online I requested a booth and mentioned that I was pregnant.  We were seated as requested and our server bent over backwards to make sure he was aware of any and all food restrictions I had.  The food was all delicious.  We had the st. Andre cheese (my favorite) and the brisket and biscuits as well as the rib eye.  My hubby indulged in a glass of red and just for fun we split the chocolate dessert.  It was a deconstructed s'more and was melt in your mouth yummy.  The service was spectacular, we were checked on often and never wanted for anything.  The food was worth the price and the ambience was wonderful.  Overall a fantastic date night and we can't wait to return (and try the executive chefs other restaurants).\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife took me to The House Brasserie for my birthday dinner.  We told them we wanted a \"Chef's Choice\" experience - this means we'll eat whatever they send out.\n\nOur server was awesome and very helpful.  She helped guide us through the entire evening with wine pairings and wow, did she do a great job.  The chef, Matt Hobbs, also came out a few times to see how everything was going.\n\nThe food was amazing - I love that they're not stuck in any particular genre; instead the flavors included traditional, Asian, BBQ . . . \n\nAnyway, I highly suggest THB, especially if you're adventurous to let someone else choose the plates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe house is cool first off - a 1939 Sears kit house.  Probably cost $800 back then, still here! Has a huge Ponderosa Pine planted in 1944. History & ambiance matters and this place has it. Started with foie gras - Very good! Crispy artichoke, mostly cheese but very good. Asparagus worth it! Roasted cauliflower the best. Waited a long time between food items, shared selections not very large. Good for maybe two skinny people. Still a nice experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my first Yelp review.  The House Brasserie was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time.  I had a group of 15 people for a birthday party this past Saturday night.  I called for a reservation a month ago and reached one of the owners- Brian.  He was extremely helpful.  The food was very good and excellently prepared.  I could go on and on, but by reading the menu you can see how inventive some of the dishes are.  In addition to the great food (and drinks) the service was fantastic.  Many times in a larger group either the food or the service fall short and sometimes both.  This was not the case at all- everyone enjoyed their meal and the service and I am excited to return again.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat an incredibly gorgeous place to spend an evening:  sitting outside on the patio, surrounded by twinkling lights, underneath a massive redwood tree.  The ambiance could not have been better (full moon didn't hurt), but add in the stellar service and the incredible food and this might be my favorite new \"nice place\" to dine.  This is not an inexpensive place to eat, but worth every penny.  In particular, I recommend the steak tartare appetizer, the scallop entree, and the side of basil and brie smashed potatoes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe enjoyed our dinner.  It was exceptional.  Remember you are paying for exquisite dining, not big portions.  (if that is your intent go to Claim Jumper :( )\n\nI've seen several comments on the service.  I would like to note something extraordinary happened.  We were introduced to our server who was going to be right back when another one of her tables broke a glass of wine and she had to attend to them.  Within a matter of minutes another server took over for her and we were not left waiting while the first waitress assisted the other patrons with resetting their table.  Personally I see a lot of merit and selflessness in this which is indicative of an establishment that focuses on the needs of the customer.  So whatever other negative comments there may be on service I'd like to counter that ours was a positive experience.  Thank you Ashley, you were a great server.\n\nThe dining experience and quality were as expected for a high end establishment so we were not let down and very satisfied.  We had the scallops, fillet, mac & cheese, Dungeness crab fried rice and (for fun) the crinkle cut fries.  Everything was great but the crab fried rice was mildly spicier than expected and we wished there was more of a crab taste and an indication of crab pieces.\n\nThe ambiance was wonderful both inside and outside.\n\nThe bar - THIS is what a bar should look like.  I want to go back just to sit and have a drink at the bar it was so classy.\n\nAlso, they are experimenting with fixed courses and wine pairing which are limited to a few number of people each night.  The table we saw that opted for this dinner looked like they were having lots of fun and the manager and chef came out and engaged with the table often.  I suggest you splurge for this at the extra cost and enjoy it yourself. \n\nWe will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn rec from a friend went to HB for Sunday brunch. The food was fantastic and though it was noon it was not crazy loud, a pet peeve of mine re brunch. The rose sangria was great and the steak chilaquiles had the perfect amount of heat to let you know we are in PHX. The bahn mi is a stroke of genius; I have never had with egg before, defined an improvement. I only wish they were open for lunch so I could enjoy this every day. The salmon salad plate was a scrumptious combination of beet pickle egg, onion and a chive creme fresh with crispy crust bread. The corn crepes were totally not what I expected...much better! Great way to end the meal. Great plates to share and the waitstaff top notch. Will be back fer sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe dined @ House Brasserie this weekend for the second time. We love the atmosphere and when it gets a bit cooler here in AZ, the outdoor seating will be a wonderful place to enjoy a meal.\nWe ordered 4 appetizers to share:  Steak Tartare was delicious; Foie Gras was pretty good; House Brisket and Biscuits was fine but nothing special and the Duck Meatballs were terrible - dry and odd flavor. \nOur entrees were delicious - Scallops and Halibut - both presentations were beautiful and the fish was cooked perfectly - very moist. Ordered 2 desserts - Chocolate Budino which was good and Apple Upside Down Cake which was good but the delicate flavor of the cake was a bit overpowered by the strong flavor of the Pistachio ice cream, which was delicious. \nWine list is very small BTW. They offer @ 4  \"inexpensive\" ($70) bottles and the rest are over $100.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love trying new restaurants, and was so happy that my husband chose this gem to celebrate my birthday last evening. We were greeted immediately and sat in a beautiful corner booth. The ambiance is romantic, and I can't wait for the weather to cool off so I can sit outside next time.  The place is upscale, but you can dress in jeans and some heals and still fit in fine. I have no other words except sensational! If food sex is a thing, then House Brasserie is my new boyfriend. My server made me feel special and immediately offered me champaign for my birthday when he asked what we were celebrating. I opted for a martini, as it was a long day! My ONLY feedback is to get some martini glasses, as they served it in a margarita glass. But the drink was just the right amount of dirty!  We started with 2 small plates: Smoked Burrata and Frois Gras....If the meal ended there I would have still been happy. For the main we ordered the Jidori Chicken and the Filet, and shared. As sides we got fries and the lobster rice. You could cut the fillet with a fork, seriously my husband did it without using his knife.  But the chicken stole the show. It had an incredible flavor that couldn't be topped. The flavors of every dish we tried burst in our mouths. I could not have had a better meal at any other restaurant. I was actually mad at my husband for making me wait till 8:30 for dinner because we couldn't get a reservation earlier, but if I had to go back at 3 am to taste this wonderful food again, I would do it!  I closed the evening with a great glass of Rose' and a complimentary Creme Brule' which happens to be my favorite dessert. The simple details like the sliced strawberries on my desert were the freshest I have ever tasted. Find a way to dine here, you will not regret it! Thank you House Brasserie for a wonderful evening! We will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved this place - from the excellent service by our waitress, Ashley, to the great food - an all-around great experience.  Ashley was knowledgeable about the wine and menu items and gave us samples so we could decide between two we were considering.  We will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur second visit to The House was just as delightful as our first!  The service at this restaurant is better than we have ever experienced - it's just amazing.  Warm, friendly, knowledgeable but not bothersome or overbearing.  \nOur choices on this visit did not disappoint and included Baked St. Andre Cheese for starter followed by the Arizona Arugula, Shallot, and Strawberry Salad.  Our entree was a special on this night - a Rib-eye on Udon noodles with Saffron and a side of Dungeness Crab Fried Rice.    We would order each one again, but we so enjoy trying the new offerings at The House!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here, brought another couple and the food was good but was overshadowed by poor service from our waiter, who seemed not care about anything. Our waiter showed no enthusiasm when we were seated and didn't mention any specials but told us what they were out of. Three of us had chicken which was good, one had the ribeye which came with what I thought  was a baked potatoes but came with a potato in a small dish which was about 65 percent blue cheese and 35 percent actual potato, I did not like it and when the waiter came around I politely mentioned it and he said, ok and walked away, he made no attempt to offer me something's else or redo the side dish. Later the manager was making the rounds, at this time we were finished with our dinner and she offered to get me another side, which she did about 15 minutes later which was about 30 minutes after we finished our dinner. The dinner was $45 for the steak which was fair at best. \n\nWe ordered coffee and some deserts and the coffee came late and the waiter mumbled something about the coffee maker, my guest wanted a refill on the coffee and the waiter was no where to be found.  \n\nGiven our first and only experience here taking some clients out for dinner I would say it greatly disappointed us all. It isn't inexpensive, the food was fair and the service was a 3 out of 10.\n\nAdditionally make a reservation earlier in the week became complicated on their end and they called us three times to change things and told us we would get champagne for being so patient with them in trying to book a reservation, we of course did not get champagne, nor did they likely remember they even told us that. One of the calls they made TO us to change the time after they called US they put us on hold.\n\nBased on the other reviews perhaps we just had a lot of bad luck?\n\n\n\n\n\nYummy! Loved the bartender. Loved the food (chef trained at French Laundry). Great ambiance. If your looking for history this is your spot house built in '37.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House is just how it sounds. It is amazing that Matt Carter(Zinc Bistro and Mission) continues to evolve. So comforting and service was amazinng, especially considering it has only been open a few weeks. King crab and smoked gouda fondue! Roasted Halibut! and the Lamb Bolognese was suprisinglyreally good, the lemon marscopone and mint worked fantastically! Patio is amazing weather permitting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis might be my new favorite restaurant...it's made the top 10 list. The past two Fridays, I've been here for dinner and everything is amazing. The second you walk up, you can just tell this is going to be a great dinner spot. The patio is just about the cutest thing ever - it's like you're transported outside of the Valley into this magical little courtyard with twinkle lights everywhere (what girl doesn't love twinkle lights?)\n\nThe only cocktail I've had there is the Watermelon Cooler (I'll add the pic). It's a refreshing gin cocktail equipped with fresh watermelon juice and effen cumcumber vodka - everything I love in a cup. The food is amazing. Both times I went, my girlfriends and I shared everything. Some of the highlights are the Burrata with leeks, the berkshire pork belly with udon noodles, and the Duck Confit meatballs. We also tried the lobster fried rice, crab legs, Pork Ribs, and Halibut. Everything is good but my favorite is the pork belly with udon noodles. It's just so GD good. \n\nThey've only been open about a month so they warn you that they're working out the kinks in service and what not. It doesn't matter. They could make me wait a year and I'd still sit there and sipon my cocktail among good friends to wait for their amazing food. \n\nHats off to you House Brasserie. I'll be back soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet ANOTHER amazing evening at House Brasserie. We've been here for our anniversary, my birthday, and now Christmas Eve. The food is creative and always delicious. The service is superb, and the ambience is romantic and most comfortable. Needless to say, we'll be celebrating many more events here.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfect for a romantic evening out.  We went here for Valentine's Day and were very happy with the food/wine we ordered. The only thing that was disappointing is that they were out of our first wine choice, but everything else was really good. I'd recommend this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexible with reservation and the place was packed.  Good atmosphere and diverse crowd.   Menu is amazing with great options for \"small plates\"/appetizers.  Main courses were also like looking at multiple different nice restaurants. Incredible range that makes me want to go back tommorrow. Reasonably priced food for the quality that's served.   Attentive staff, including the hostess that had the most drinks in the entire place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has a very cool vibe to it.  We decided to sit outside but the inside is darling.  The bar is also nice front and center as you walk in the door.  Waitress was ok.  She sort of disappeared right before we were ready to order.  Other then that the service was decent.  We started with a melted cheese similar to Brie it was good but the portion was very small.  We also shared a small roasted peach salad with arugula which was fine.  Two of the diners had the Halibut.  Again very good mix of flavors but very small portions.  The other diner had the lamb bolognese.  Another small portion.  We had two deserts a chocolate cake and a butterscotch pudding.  Hadn't had butterscotch pudding in years and it was good and rich like it should be.  I was with all women and I barely felt full when I left.  I think my husband would have left hungry had he been there.  I would be willing to give this another try for sure.  On a side note, I always leave Zinc Bistro hungry too.\n\n\n\n\n\nI recently hosted a baby shower here for my sister. The service was phenomenal. Brian, the GM was very accommodating. He put together a fabulous menu and saw to it that we had everything we needed. I love the ambiance at The House; the food and service put it over the top. Worth every penny.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo here sit down.  Tell the server if u have any allergies and what protein u don't eat and then let them plan ur dinner!  And wine pairings with. Best experience.  The server brought out food that I would never have ordered before and everything was phenomenal!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had high expectations and was left with a bitter taste in my mouth.  For my appetizer the fried chicken oysters tasted like flour and were over cooked.  They actually left a very bitter aftertaste.  The short rib was tough and I was not impressed with the olive and pickled yellow tomato combo.  The smoke mushrooms had a great smokiness but with a sweet sauce that was not to my liking.  The cauliflower side was okay, but I have had better.  My wife had the filet.  It was flavorless and not seasoned.  The pepper and corn that comes with it is just okay.  The dining experience itself is okay and the staff was good.  However the food did not live up to what I expect. I hope next time when I try different items it will be different.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW! Thanks to Lindsey F, I feel like I'm becoming a PHX/Scottsdale culinary aficionado in no time! I live in Tucson and heading to Phoenix doesn't always feel like a \"getaway\" type of visit until now. I'm officially in the \"know\" of some remarkable spots and The House Brasserie is one of them. From its unique story, to incredible makeover to the quaint and romantic outdoor patio lined with twinkle lights to the fabulous bathrooms and of course the divine cuisine this place is nothing short of a solid 5-stars. The House Brasserie had recently opened and they treated our group of about 12 people to seamless and delightful evening.\n\nI learned that night the that The House is actually \"home\" to the second old house in Scottsdale. The owners did an incredible two year remodel without compromising the original structure of this historical home. It's worth a visit even for a tour of the place. But, really the food and drinks are just as incredible.\n\nWe sat down for dinner out on the patio. Even with a group of 12, it felt intimate. We dined family style and it was more food than I could dream of! Chef came out to greet us and share a little background about his menu. I'm thankful that he did! Although the menu appears to be heavily influenced by European cuisine, there's no real category for this place and that's with intent. Chef cooks what he thinks will be delicious and his dishes draw from various global cuisines. \n\nMy experience with most family-style dinners is that the food runs out or by the time you eat it it's cold. That was not the case here! \nOur first course sampling was as follows:\n-Charcuterie Board with Saint Andre Cheese (my personal heaven!)\n-Wood Grilled Cab legs with Aji Mamrillo Butter. Fresh as can be. \n-House Brisket & Biscuit with a chili jam and white cheddar. \n-Kale Salad with Miso Peppercorn Dressing: I love me some Kale and I could eat this salad all day long!\n-Farro Salad with Arugula and Butternut squash. Hearty and flavorful\n-Peel & Eat Shrimp: worth the effort with a spicy kick\n-Duck Confit Meatballs- need I day more?\n\nBy this point we were all wow'd and the main course offerings kicked it up another notch. From the Berkshire Pork Ribs that were fall off the bone tender and juicy to the \nChateau Briand and Marinate Jidori Chicken. It was an incredible feast. But the sides were superstars too! Lobster fried rice and Broccoli Carbonara. I was smitten.\n\nSomehow we had room for dessert. I didn't. But I had to taste it. Missing out was not an option. Caramel Apple Upside Down Cake. Blackberry Crumb Cake. Perfection.\n\nThe House Brasserie is all about the culinary adventure. I loved everything about it. And don't miss out on their craft cocktails, as they also put as much effort into their freshly squeezed juices/mixes as they do in the kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't been, what are you waiting for?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter tonight my stomach Was full but my wallet was empty. Really enjoyed the food and had a grate times every thing is sooo good. Really worth it every  sent. Supper expensive like way to much for my wallet if my parents weren't there I would probably be stuck doing the dishes. Lol \n   Maybe that how they got so many young wasters and waitresses. Jk. \n  Fun looking food and drinks, dad had a neck of lam. Is was a pice of are how they layout  the food one the plate in a pattern. Mine was pulled duck and pasta.  It was just enough where you my be want more but don't get more. You be broke unless you really wanna eat some delicious chocolate pudding with peanuts and marshmallow.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is amazing Chef Matt Carter certainly knows what he is doing with his new concept. The menu is well-rounded and has a bit of European influence, with a touch of South American and Asian if that makes sense. Pretty much a little bit of everything. \n\nThe owners did an amazing job decorating what I came to find out was the second oldest home in Scottsdale. A truly beautiful dining experience. The bar is lively and fun, yet the patio is intimately different in a way that makes you feel like you aren't i the Scottsdale tourist district. \n\nWe were greeted with complimentary champagne upon arrival and enjoyed the most fabulous cocktails and shared plates at the bar before seating (the bar menu is ridiculous). Bartenders have tons of personality and you can see how much they pay attention to the details of their craft with the way they make their cocktails and one even showed us some of the many syrups and liquors they make in \"House\". \n\nWe then moved to one of the Cabana tables by the front of the restaurant (closest to Main St). It felt like we had our own private dining room in the middle of a candle lit garden setting. We continued with some very competitively priced reserved wines and even worked our way into their extensive beer list. Our server explained that the dining style of \"The House\" was to order a few of the larger Entree/Main Dishes along with several sides and shared plates to accompany them for the group to enjoy the meal in a family style environment while also giving everyone at the table the opportunity to both try and taste everything was the best way to go. Our server certainly gave us the right direction because every plate left empty and everyone loved everything. \n\nSeveral people ordered dessert which all looked amazing, but I saved myself for what our server said was \"The House Irish Coffee\". I have been to the Buena Vista in San Francisco where this drink was created, but their version was absolutely unreal. I am not sure exactly which person working at \"The House\" came up with the recipe for that cocktail but I need to shake their had because they truly revolutionized an amazing classic in their own special way. Perfect nightcap to an amazing evening with great friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for our anniversary dinner. We didn't have a reservation, but we must have gone at the right time as we were seated immediately. Reading some other reviews and tips, this sounds pretty freakn rare. \n\nEnded up getting the Aged Goats cheese plate, wild sea bass, duck bolognese, and brussel sprouts.\n\nThe aged goat cheese plate was really good. I am not a fan of blue cheese, but that whole element of the aged goat cheese was not overpowering. It was a perfect balance. Really enjoyed it, more than i thought i would (my wife prefers it thats why we ordered it). The sea bass itself was just okay, The skin could have been crispier, but the plate as a whole was delicious. There were so many elements on the plate, that when eaten together, it elevated the plate a lot. The kimchee they used on the plate was really tame for kimchee, but it had the perfect elements needed to enhance this sea bass. The duck was rich, I enjoyed it. I wish there was more duck in there, or larger chunks instead of shredded. It was my wife's plate, so the few bites I had I enjoyed, the creaminess of the marscapone, with the pasta really balanced out the richness of duck.\n\nBrussel sprouts were well cooked, but a little heavy handed on the salt, for our preference. \n\nThe service was great, and they brought us out some champagne and a deconstructed cheesecake, which was a great way to end the meal.\n\nWe'd come back and definitely try something different on the menu, not necessarily cause we were unhappy, but because everything sounded delicious (and some other dishes at the tables around us looked tasty)\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely love this new addition to Old Town Scottsdale!  Great, quaint patio, nice decor, great service and tasty food.  I tried the chicken parmesan sandwich and really liked it...great tomato sauce!  We shared two desserts and were pleased with them as well.  I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 since my friend tried to make a lunch reservation and they gave her a hard time about being too full.  I arrive and the place was more than half empty the entire time we were there...seems weird to me!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad an amazing dinner last night with New friends. Our server (AJ) was a great host and bartender (Kenny) kept the party rolllin from start to finish.  HB is a tiny jewel tucked into Oldtown.  Nice, simple touches to your dining experience most restaurants miss. A must while in Scottsdale for sure. Well done!\n\n\n\n\n\nNice ambience. Romantic place. Food was Meh. Crab fried rice was painfully salty. Halibut special was rather small and unevenly seasoned. One piece was very salty and the other piece was too salty. Manager asked if we were enjoying our meal but didn't care to remedy anything.. Duck confirm was nice. Salad was unimpressive. Too many great restaurants around to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnimpressive meal in an impressive setting.\n\nNarrowed down our \"special occasion\" dining choice to Cafe Monarch and House Brasserie, with House Brasserie winning the coin toss.\n\nFound the patio area to be very pleasant due in no small part to a perfect evening weather-wise without any need for the outdoor heaters.\n\nService was uniformly friendly and professional throughout the meal. Cocktails were expertly prepared.\n\nUnfortunately, the most important element in our dining experience, the food, was disappointing.\n\nPresentation was lackluster and in some cases the dishes tasted odd or were spoiled by distracting ingredients or were served luke-warm.\n\nIn the case of the smoked burrata appetizer, a lump of cow's milk cheese was placed alongside some toasted French bread slices, presentation one would expect at a much lower-end dining establishment. \n\nWhy not place individual slices of cheese on their own crostini and garnish? The dish struck us as being very lazy.\n\nThe Tomahawk Pork Chop was smothered in some type of hard seeds. Imagine trying to enjoy one's meal, while removing tiny ball-bearings from between your teeth. It completely ruined the enjoyment of the dish.\n\nThe Lamb Bolognese had a decidely sour taste, so overpowering that it was left half-eaten by the two individuals who had ordered it as their entrees.\n\nFinally, considering the cost, as well as the formal tone of House Brasserie's website, we were surprised at the number of families with toddlers as well as patrons who were comfortable dining in pajama bottoms and baseball caps.  \n\nIt was bad enough that we had suggested this restaurant to our friends. It would've been even more uncomfortable had this been one of our formal client dinners.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I have been a huge fan of The Mission, the sister restaurant to The House. We decided to spend our anniversary at The House. What a beautiful place! We told them of our special occasion and they sat us at the outdoor fireplace. Our service from the second we walked up to the property was fantastic! The drinks are delicious and so was the food! We had a shared plate, the brisket on a biscuit and we both had the filet for our main course. Everything was spot on! It's a casual atmosphere and very low key... The food is upscale and wonderfully prepared. Prices are reasonable too. Hidden gem. Great place! We look forward to dining here again!\n\n\n\n\n\nI kept reading how this was a nice place for dinner and the patio is where you should sit. While the patio is nice, it's nothing that I would rave about. It's just some tents and a few shrubbery with tables. \n\nThe important part, the food, it was amazing. My pork chop was probably the second best one I had in my life. The mac and cheese was amazing. The lobster gnoochi was really good. The charred broccolini was good. \n\nThe service, was terrible. I don't know if our server had too many tables or what, but it ruined the dinner for us. We were starving by the time we got there. We were seated promptly. The place was not at all crowded and didn't even have a wait at 7:30. The initial greeting took a bit. We ordered drinks and an appetizer soon as we were greeted which took a good 5 minutes. Our server was super friendly and gave his opinion on the drinks which was great. 10 minutes after ordering the drinks/appetizers we ordered our entrees. A good 15 minutes or so went by n total from ordering our drinks that we actually we got our drinks. The drinks were great. At this point a table of 3 sat down next to us.  Constantly we saw trays of food come out but never did our appetizer come out. After a good 25 minutes or so from ordering the entrees, our food came out first. We never saw our server since ordering. I asked the person about our appetizer when they delivered the food. About 5 minutes had gone by and our server came by, apologized about the appetizer not coming out and that it would be on its way out now. Okay...things happen. 10 minutes later our appetizer comes out. At this point we've already eaten most of our meal and our $20 appetizer now reaches the table. Our server never once came by to ask how our food was, how it turned out, offered us more drinks, even when the apology for the appetizer happened. We literally got no service from this point on except for the water guy. We counted 4x that we went to another table near us that we noticed. Again, never once anything in our direction. We were annoyed and wondering why we were being given the cold shoulder. He finally came by after I can't even tell you how long, but we had been done, drinks were drained more than half an hour ago, and we just wanted to be done with this place. He asked if he could clear our plates. We said yes. Honestly we hadn't finished half our food because we over ordered. I didn't notice at first, but he stacked the plates and wasted a good amount of food instead of asking if we'd like it to go. He showed us the dessert menu, but again, at this point we said no thanks and wanted our check. After waiting a good 5 minutes, I gave him another 5 minutes before he got our check before I was ready to go find it myself. Finally the check was delivered and we waited another 10 minutes for the whole process to take place. We were looking around, it had been two hours. Things had definitely slowed down. This is not what I expect for $150+ dinner. I expect better service and get better service at Chipotle. \n\nAgain, the food was amazing and maybe our server was having a bad night, under staffed etc. but I expect more for my money and not sure if I'd ever go back or recommend this place. It would've been far better if we hadn't watched him cater to the people near us repeatedly without even glancing in our direction. I would've preferred to go next door I said at the end of the night and gotten a pizza.\n\n\n\n\n\nA short distance from where we stayed (Hotel Valley Ho), this became our favorite place of choice for drinks.\nMaybe one of the best Bar Tenders ever - Billy make crazy craft cocktails and knows his wine. The entire staff is trained well, friendly and nice.\nOne MUST try - FOIE GRAS. Since we cannot eat this in Cali, we had it every day with the chef making different variations. YUMMI.\nI could write a long long review, but just go there and you will happy like we were.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing! I was there for a work dinner and the atmosphere, staff, and food were incredible! The owner was right outside and asked what we though as we left and it was definitely worth every penny!! Perfect date night spot also. Can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you for bringing such a charming restaurant to Old Town! I am giving The House a solid five stars and it's because they have the perfect ambiance and delicious food to accompany it. The ambiance is what really sets this restaurant apart from any other restaurant in Old Town. \n\nWhen I go out out to eat, I like to experience the complete package: experience + delicious cuisine. Many times, restaurants focus so much on their culinary creations that they forget about working on the environment. This is not the case for The House. The House is 'housed' within the second oldest house in Scottsdale. During my visit, I learned about the delightful woman who grew up in the house and how she loved her rose bushes. She was a member of one of the first families in Scottsdale and during one of the wars, she would deliver fallen soldier notices and then lend a helping hand to the families while they went through their time of loss. The history alone of this house defines the charm.\n\nHidden in a quiet street that's often missed (luckily) by the bar/club scene, The House is like a place you wish you could call home. Twinkle lights light up the spacious patio and large and luscious trees surround the perimeter. The interior of the house is just as charming as the exterior. At night, the intimate indoor glows with romantic candlelight while the warmth from the wood fired oven heats up the environment. It's the perfect environment for a date night or if you're looking for a nice setting for out of town guests, etc. \n\nNow that I've gushed about the environment, I will move on to the food. The food here is nothing less than spectacular, but I am not surprised because this is Matt Carter's brain child and he also runs The Mission down the street. I came here with a group of 15 and they did an excellent job serving us a variety of delicious food. The menu allowed us to sample the following:\n\nWood Grilled Crab Legs with Aji Amarillo Lime Butter - this is buttery goodness at it's best. The crab is fresh, completely buttered and delicious. \n\nHouse Brisket & Biscuit - this is a nice option for a hearty appetizer. The brisket is tender and well seasoned. \n\nPeel and Eat Shrimp - spicy alert! This dish as a serious kick and if you can handle the spice, this is definitely worth ordering. \n\nKale Sale with Miso Peppercorn Dressing - I'm not a huge fan of kale, but I will say that for kale, they did a good job flavoring it and making it eatable for even the non-kale eaters. \n\nItalian Farro Salad \nDuck Confit Meatballs - I had no idea I was eating duck! However, it's tasty and just the right size to pop in your mouth. \n\nBerkshire Pork Country Ribs - the meat falls off the bones out of tenderness and it's seasoned with a spice that has a kick. \n\nChateau Briand, Marinated Jidori Chicken, Lobster Friend Rice , Broccoli Carbonarra -- all these dishes were good. None of them stood out in my mind, but they were still incredibly tasty. \n\nCaramel Apple Upside Down Cake & Crumb Cake & Sacher Torte - pure sugary bliss!! \n\nI've already written a lengthy review, but before I say goodbye, I will also mention their hand crafted cocktails. They are superb! The drinks are made with freshly squeezed fruit, etc. They are a must if you enjoy craft cocktails!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all customer service was great!\nThe starters and side dishes delicious \nAnd the Umami Rib eye was sooo good and it melts in your mouth !\n\n\n\n\n\nGo here for the ambiance. Seriously. If you are looking for a date night, this is it. \n\nThe food is great, the staff are very knowledgeable, and me and my dining partner felt satisfied by the food and beverage, along with the staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place. Went there for an important date and we had a lot of fun. The wait staff was a lot more fun and personable than I've experienced at restaurants of this caliber. Everything was just perfect - we will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust had to add this. We came back for Valentine's Day and had another fabulous experience - from the amazing food to the incredible staff!  Worth every penny!  Our waiter, Tommy, was awesome.  Other restaurants should learn how to train their staff by observing this place.  Hands down, our favorite place in Scottsdsle.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a charming place. I have been meaning to go to The House for a long time and finally made my way there this weekend. I wish I had not waited so long- The food and the service were fantastic. Our server Megan was very knowledgeable and you could tell that she was passionate about her place of work. Something I truly appreciate in a hospitality professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncredibly unique place to eat in AZ. The food is unbelievable, the service is great, and the ambiance has to be one of the best in the entire state. Outside seating recommended. There is nothing like it. Great music and vibe as well. In my opinion, this is one of the best places to wine and dine, especially for dates and anniversaries. Dinner menu recommended over lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to House Brasserie Friday night for a friend's birthday and loved it. The atmosphere is warm, the perfect kind of dim, absolutely charming. We had really nice drinks and the bartender was very accommodating about my requests to change the French 75 - and it was delish.  We had smoked burrata and the Barolo salumi, both were delicious.  Two of us shared a salad, which was good, and I had the filet. I like well-done meat, which is often a problem because it offends the kitchen - not here.  Thank you!!! Everyone lived their entrees (huge ribeye, scallops).  Didn't love the texture of the duck meatballs, but flavor was great. Dessert was yummy - especially the apple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream. That doesn't sound good, but it was amazing! He service was absolutely fantastic (thanks Tommy), too. I cannot wait to return - and sit on the gorgeous patio.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, I am high maintenance and very picky!!!!! Saying that, This place passed the test!!!! Everything about it was over the top!!! It is pricy but so worth it!  If you are about the price this is NOT your place.  Love this place!!!! Top notch all the way!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me start with the place.\n\nIt's a beautiful house with a nice bar, backyard and outside area right in Old Town Scottsdale. Five stars for that. As a curious fact, the restrooms are outside and are small. \n\nThe food was good but nothing memorable. Everything in the porkbelly dish was tasteful except the porkbelly, that's sad. The noodles and egg were a great mix but the meat lack flavor and it was undercoocked from my point of view.\n\nThe Dr. Pepper meat with cheese fries was pretty good.\n\nI had the filet and it was uneventful.\n\nAlthough I have to say that the goat cheese cake was delicious. I would go back just for that.\n\nCoffee was good too.\n\nThe service... well, the service was pretty bad. We learned about the special of the day because the table next to us was told (while we were already eating). To get refills was a journey. My friend asked for fresh napkins and she ended up helping herself. Oh well, good news is that there's plenty of room for improvement.\n\nCheers\n\n\n\n\n\nBy far, The most amazing dinning experience of my life!\nChef Carter and His amazing team, from Tommy as our server to Chef Himself created a flavorful story this evening....\nJust a simple girl, the love of her life Bill and our beautiful daughter Sydney had an experience that we will remember for a life time.\nThank You\nDiana\n\nHope to visit your world again soon.\n..\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the most friendly and knowledgable service I've had in a while! The food was all delicious. Rich and on the salty side but interesting and unique!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came across this gem as we were on our way to another restaurant in the area (which also got glowing reviews from the staff here so we will be going there next ).  The ambiance is amazing.  Very quaint and charming.  We did not have a reservation but they accommodated us.  Staff is five star top notch.  I ordered the green lantern cocktail and it was smooth and complex and everything that a cocktail should be.  The chef sent out a small horderve made of puff pastry and cheese that was delicious.  We ordered the lobster gnocchi appetizer, Cesar salad, scallops entree, and broccolini side.  Our food was brought out appropriately and timely for each course.  The food was well prepared , lots of flavor. We ordered the lemon bar for dessert.  Good flavor, but I think the crust was a little dense which made it difficult to cut.  The almond meringues served with the lemon bar were a nice offset to the tartness.  All in all, in all, we loved this spot.  Will definitely be returning!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to be drinking the cool aid if you like this place.  Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is charming and the staff is great (two things that are super important in dining).  But if you want a great meal and a fair price, this is not the place for you.  Portions were TINY in comparison to the PRICE.  Food was okay, nothing to write home about.  \n\nIt's funny, at the end of the night my wife and I said \"wow, the best thing we tasted were the french fries.\"  At any rate, after a $350 bill with tip NOT SUPER IMPRESSED.  I would not go back based on that.  If the food was AMAZEBALLS, then maybe, but it wasn't that.  \n\nWhen I got home I ate a Cliff bar so at least I had something to eat.  Place doesn't work for me, if you want to just blow cash and say you were there then fine.  For a great meal I would (and will be) looking somewhere else.  \n\nAgain, no disrespect to the staff, which were very attentive.\n\nHave fun, and Find Your Sizzle\n\nAttorney Steve, the Business and Real Estate Lawyer.\n\nhttp://www.attorneysteve.net\n\n\n\n\n\nI loved this restaurant. We had a reservation for 7 girls and were seated immediately on the patio upon arrival. The service was great and the atmosphere is very cozy. I got the lamb bolognese with a side of brussel sprouts and I couldn't believe how good it was! Great portion sizes and the flavor was amazing. I would definitely return to this restaurant the next time I visit Scottsdale!\n\n\n\n\n\nFood: Amazing. Best we've had in Phoenix.\nDrinks: Also great!! Best we've had in Phoenix.\nService: Couldn't have been better.\nAmbiance: So romantic! We had an early reservation (6:15) on a weeknight, so we were the first ones there, and got our pick of tables. Of course, I chose the table for two in front of the outdoor fireplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nDont necessarily agree with all these reviews. The house brasserie does have a nice patio but the food was not well thought out. Steak tartar was roughly cut and accompanied by some fries that tasted like they were purchased at costco in the frozen food section. My chicken was way over cooked and the desserts Had this generic flavor (processed). Overall this does not seem like a spot thats going to impress your guest with there culinary skill.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatio seating was beautiful. Menu looks delicious online, food was atrocious in person. I took two bites of the lobster gnocchi and that was it. The plate looked disgusting and tasted worse.  Two people in my group ordered the chicken entree, they said it was gross. Chicken was soggy, one piece was unsalted the other was pure salt.  The worst part about it, is how over priced it is. Complete waste of money, unfortunately we chose there to celebrate birthday, which by the way they do nothing for. (Not even wish you a happy birthday) so disappointed this was the place we chose when there are so many delicious and beautiful options for an occasion. The server did not help make the experience any better, just rude girl honestly.\n\n\n\n\n\nI recently had my wife's birthday party at The House.   We had 30 people dining with us.  The setting was beautiful.  I was worried the night might be a little chilly to dine outside as it was in the 40's, but the tents combined with heaters kept the temperature very comfortable.  We had the heaters running well below full blast as it was getting too warm. Sitting out on the patio with the fireplace going made the event feel even more festive.\nHow did it all go? First, the good:  Sonia, the events manager was very responsive and helpful.  She delivered exactly what was promised.  The food was very good.  I had skirt steak which was well seasoned and had delicious accoutrements.  My wife's swordfish was also excellent.  Cocktails were delicious and wine was fairly priced.  Next the better: the service.  It was just about perfect.  The servers were very friendly.  We were well attended with respect to drinks and orders and the food came out efficiently around the table.  I had a cake delivered earlier in the day which they kept and plated for a nominal fee.  The bad: I can't think of a thing.  The House really knocked it out of the park.  My wife had an amazing time.  I wouldn't hesitate to have an event there again in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was looking forward to trying the house. I'm a big fan of the Mission! \nThe atmosphere and deco get an easy 5 stars, such a cute little place. I wish it was cool enough to sit at the patio. But in August... we sat at the bar. \nThe service was friendly but sometimes over friendly...in an awkward way. But really the food was just okay, nothing special. we had the smoked burrata and the ricotta on a toast, both were okay. the presentation was very nice, flavors were good but nothing that makes you want to lick the bowl. For main course I had the fish and he had the chicken jidori. My flavors were good but for him , the dish was too small. For dessert we had the goat cheese cake, really good and very interesting combination of flavors. Overall good! but nothing that made me want to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove. This. Place. This restaurant is just simply perfect. I love the atmosphere (chic), ambiance (cozy), cuisine (modern American) and located off the main street which gives it a more low-key feel. It is a smaller restaurant with a great outdoor patio and amazing decor both inside and out. And don't forget about the oak tree, oldest one around.\n\nHouse brisket and biscuit was superb. It was rich but extremely flavorful. All of the cocktails are hand-pressed and exquisite. \n\nSave room for a cup of coffee and if you're going to do that you may as well have some dessert. Coffee is amazing (and dessert). I will be back to try more!\n\nAn extreme fan of Chef Matt Carter! You definitely will not be disappointed, the best combo of service and hospitality for all!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was excellent, as was the server but the service itself was slow.  A great place for a date or a small group when you are in no rush or when wrapping up wine tasting at Lawrence Dunham Vineyard around the corner.  I would recommend the scallops, the fillet and the fried rice.\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably my favorite part about eating here is the ambiance. We read that the patio is rated one of the most romantic spots in the area and decided to give it a try for date night. It isn't super romantic in my opinion, but the candles and overhead string lighting do make it a cozy outdoor experience. \n\nThe food was very good, my favorite item was definitely the smoked burrata which offered a delicious combination of savory soft burrata cheese with the light sweetness of the date gastrique. \n\nI was disappointed that although the menu lists a soup & salad section there was no soup available. The salads were okay, I preferred the \"Little Gem\" salad to the Arizona arugula which lacked flavor and substance. The Gem had delicious candied walnuts and crispy lettuce with enough dressing to make it taste great. \n\nThe chef brought out a couple of complimentary pastries with parmesan and truffle oil that was delicious. In fact, I liked it more than anything else we had. \n\nThe crispy chicken was good, not dried out like you find at most restaurants. I also recommend the Brussels sprouts, they are crispy and full of flavor.\n\nI had the Smokey Manhattan which was surprisingly tasty and refreshing. If you aren't in to sweet drinks then it isn't for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been to the House twice now and I'm more and more impressed after each visit. For starters, the atmosphere is perfect. The setting is very personal and intimate inside and their patio is equally inviting. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to food and drink selections and very courteous and attentive. On our first visit our bartender Kevin welcomed us and after finding out it was our first visit he took the time to suggest several food selections and drinks. \n\nThe food is some of the best I've sampled in the valley; every dish is off the beaten path and an unexpected joy to taste for the first time. Far to often new establishments play it safe and don't stray to far from the norm of southwestern cuisine but The House Brasserie's kitchen and chef do a remarkable job of introducing their patrons to a sampling of dishes that are both creative and amazing. My suggestion, try the Duck Confit Bahn Mi!\n\nIf you're looking for an excellent meal that outside the norm you've got to stop by The House Brasserie.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place for lunch, haven't had a bad meal. Small and personal but very big in taste and service.\n\n\n\n\n\nStop what you're doing!!!!!\n\nIf you are the type of person that only reads the 5 star reviews then you get what you deserve. Like we did on this one. Should have went more with the Google reviews which had it closer to 3 stars.\n\nNot sure what they are thinking here with all these flavors and weird dishes but they don't work!\n\nAdd chopped onions to the Mac and cheese? Why?\n\nHuge pieces of Lemon Peel on top of the Short Rib? Why??\n\nDeconstructed Lobster Bisque? Weird and no one seemed to be a fan.\n\nAt the end of the day you just have to ask yourself if you'd order any of the things you've ordered, again. The answer was a resounding NO.\n\nEven the mixed drinks were weird.\n\nNot to mention the prices. Just retarded\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't post negative reviews.   However when I find a gem I tell people.    Went to this restaurant owner's sister restaurant in Scottsdale, The Mission, and was disappointed to find a 2 hour wait.   The owner, Brian, noticed my irritated expression and approached me.   He referred us, a party of 5 to The House Brasserie.    Brian even called us a golf cart taxi.    \nBy any means this place is great.    Food, service and ambiance all reflect everyone passion for their brand.   It is obvious when employees believe in what they are selling.    The Chef, Ashley, even made an appearance at our table and sent us some items.    \nIn Scottsdale, eat at either restaurant and you won't be disappointed.   We went to the Mission the next night and were equally impressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has been my favorite restaurant for over a year now. First off, it's set in a perfect location, just to the East of Hotel Valley Ho; in the third oldest house in Scottsdale.  The ambience is something out of an F Scott Fitzgerald novel. The spacious front patio is set in a rose garden with beautiful lighting. The inside, with chandeliers and textured golden walls, is absolutely beautiful, and complete with a built in bar that I love to sit at and chat with the bartender. The House Brasserie delightfully ends up being a mix of historic quaintness with modern luxury.\n\nEverything I've ordered at House Brasserie I've loved. I usually let my friends/guests decide what to order and share family style because every option is too good-- I get overwhelmed choosing. The service is excellent and I love being surprised by extra appetizers 'compliments of the chef.' The handcrafted drinks are unique and delicious. If you are one of the rare people in this world who likes fernet, try the House Call! It's my favorite.\n\nI'm also always appreciative of nice/fancy bathrooms. I love how the bathrooms are in the converted shed/garage and incredibly well done.\n\nDon't pass this up if you are looking for an all-around excellent experience on your next culinary adventure!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you were ever having a dilemma of choosing to go here for food or drinks between cafe monarch, Fnb, or virtu, go with any of the other 3 rather than here. Food, if you are hungry, they are tolerable; drinks, you are better off going all the way to bitter twisted in downtown Phoenix. The location and ambiance are nice.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn our last night in AZ, after dining at Hillstone and Lon's at the Hermosa the previous two nights, we headed to Scottsdale to try The House Brasserie. Best decision ever. We were seated on the front patio that twinkles with lights under a white canopy. Our server Kendra was perfection: attentive but not overly so, knowledgeable, and kind. The chef sent out an amuse-bouche and we started with the baked robiola cheese. I had the lamb bolognese and we split the roasted cauliflower side. For dessert, the caramel popcorn chocolate brownie. Everything was amazing but the cauliflower was heavenly. I know it sounds crazy but it's true, I swear (and I'm dead sober). Everyone we interacted with was so kind and friendly. One of the best meals of my life. #winnerwinnerfrenchdinner\n\n\n\n\n\nDont necessarily agree with all these reviews. The house brasserie does have a nice patio but the food was not well thought out. Steak tartar was roughly cut and accompanied by some fries that tasted like they were purchased at costco in the frozen food section. My chicken was way over cooked and the desserts Had this generic flavor (processed). Overall this does not seem like a spot thats going to impress your guest with there culinary skill.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently visited Scottsdale and stumbled upon this jewel of a restaurant off the beaten path. It was so inviting from the street that we HAD to stop; little house under big beautiful trees, twinkling lights, outside patio with table lamps becconing us in. It was so warm at night that an outdoor table under the trees was perfect. The music was a nice, down-tempo house variety which set a great summer mood. We ordered food to share... brussel sprout salad, smashed fingerlings with basil and a pork dish. I have to say that with the same owners and chefs as the Mission, the food tends to be over thought a tad pretentious. The sides were simple and great but the main dish was all over the place in terms of it's flavor profile...in other words no cohesion.  The dining room and restroom are gorgeous and make for one really romantic night out and definitely worth a visit. I would recommend though, that one select the uncomplicated dishes because when they keep it simple, the food is fantastic.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery romantic, great patio, great food. The Whiskey River cocktail is amazing - I can't stop thinking about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visited the restaurant during Restauant Week and we're not given a menu for their Rest. Week options. When we asked our waiter, he said they were out of many items and he could pare items from the regular menu much better. He tried to push an expensive bottle of wine and when we requested another option, they were out of it or he wasn't happy with our choice because it was $30 less than the bottle he choose. My husband asked for fries with his dinner, which we were told they were out of- seriously how are you out of fries at 6:30 on a Saturday? So my husband choose another option - fingerling potatoes. We were almost finished with our meal, which was average, and guess what was delivered to the table next to ours, fries. When we asked our waiter if they suddenly got an order of fries, he had no response. Another waiter came over and explained that the only way you could get fries was with the steak tartare and that 'he wished he could control the kitchen'. We were so irritated that we left, leaving a 1/4 bottle of wine and went to another restaurant for a drink. They need to train their staff and order more supplies if this restaurant wants to stay in business. There are too many good restaurants in Scottsdale to deal with that.\n\n\n\n\n\nCool little spot in Old Town Scottsdale. It is in an old house. Interesting layout for the restaurant as well as the bar. I have been here a few times for drinks and appetizers as well as dinner. Last time I went I had the 10 oz filet and apps and all were delicious. Filet was Cooked perfectly a slight crisp on the outside and nice red pink interior. Drinks are strong bartender is on the ball. Wait staff is friendly and there to help with any questions on the menu. If you've never been I would suggest checking it out sometime soon. Definitely will be going back\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a writer below wrote  \"I will only comment on my choices which were presented exactly as described on the menu. The lobster appetizer starter, with a fancy name ($18) turned out to be a few pieces of tasteless lobster meat in some kind of equally tasteless sauce buried in an unimpressive French Bread and accompanied with soggy and limp French Fries\"  - am guessing frozen Orida..  And the keg wine at a sky high price.   2 \"lobster\" if you call it that and 4 glasses of wine  $94.00.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had an amazing dining experience. Very romantic setting, we had a table indoors. Perfect lighting, not too bright or too dark. We'd love to go back and try the patio out too. Our waitress did an amazing job, acknowledged our anniversary with champagne and dessert. She also gave us a little history of the building which we enjoyed. We both enjoyed our meals- scallops and salmon. Perfect place for a date night or intimate celebration dinner. Highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved it!!! Excellent entree's and wine menu! Had this on my 30th bday ..would def recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant is busy and came recommended. The decor was chandeliers, mirrors, old wallpaper... To look like an old home/cottage, but we get in and house music is blasting like its a night club. The hostess said it's because patio is busy so the music is to ensure patio is happy???? OK. Confusing. Then the menu.Very difficult to read because it was sooooo dark. Menu wasn't great, limited.  We put in an appetizer order to which the seemingly annoyed waitress said \"the kitchen likes the whole order at same time so they can time it...\" What?! Then we ask some questions about some entree descriptions and waitress again seemed  annoyed  as she told us she'd give us some time and walked away... No offer of help, no recommendations, nothing. The lobster bisque (which I live for!) Was so gross- bitter and tasted like a spoonful of burnt sherry. The amuse busch was flavorless and the chicken meatball over gnocchi was terrible. It was so bad and unpleasant we quickly canceled the firing of the steaks as we decided to leave - I've never done that before. The manager was very nice. Asked us to give the place another chance and charged $0.  Unfortunately he was the only good experience of The House.\n\n\n\n\n\nthis spot is sexy AF. took my date here and chilled at the bar with Kenny...solid dude, great old fashioned. \nfood was absolutely amazing. the filet and fried rice was delicious. our server was attentive and on her A game. \nthis place inspired my first yelp review. SOLID SPOT!\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing service and food. Definetly worth trying if you live or pass by Scotsdalle . \n\nWe were a party of. 6 and tried many different dishes. The ones that stood out were\nJidori chicken\nCarbonara broccoli \nSmoked burrata \nCrab fried rice\n\nHome made cocktails were delicious too.!\n\nBig thanks to Tommy out waiter who was amazing and so sweet. !\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been to House many times for dinner and drinks and it is outstanding to say the least. My wife and I wanted to have a small reception for our friends and family in a unique outdoor setting. House was the PERFECT place. I have been in the bar/restaurant business for over 15 years and this was the easiest planning I have ever done. Service was A+ and Chef Matt Carters food was OUTSTANDING. This is a perfect place to go for a romantic dinner, business lunch, Sat/Sun brunch, or hold a small reception/shower/reunion on their patio. What a great spot all around. If you haven't tried House you are really missing out.\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat a wonderful experience we had at this cozy dreamy restaurant. the food was great and staff were super friendly. definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting scottsdale just like us.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is excellent especially Sunday Brunch! I love the atmosphere it is totally cool. Scottsdale's oldest Christmas tree\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything about this experience was so spot-on. Every single person on staff was friendly, warm, and helpful. The food was perfection: creative, tasty, unpretentious. Both the indoor and outdoor seating is gorgeous and heavy on the ambiance (in a good way). \nWe started with the lamb&foie gras meatballs (oh, how far I've fallen from meatless diet) and the brisket + biscuit (I'm a sucker for a good rhyme). Both were incredible, and turned out to be a fair indication of what was to follow. Collectively, we ordered the streak, the lamb pasta, and the scallops. SCALLOPS FTW. Everything was beautiful and tasty, but the scallops really took it home. \nAs for drinks, don't leave here without trying their house made cinnamon whiskey. My parents loved it so much that they're still drunk as I type this. Additionally, I ordered a Pimms Mule and my mom had a Cosmo, both of which were expertly crafted and delicious. \nIf you're in Scottsdale and looking for an intimate setting with exquisite food, don't hesitate to make a reservation here (but seriously, make a reservation because this place is always poppin').\n\n\n\n\n\nLovely, rich food, adorable atmosphere, spotty service and prices that are about a third more than they should be.  If you're trying to wow a date, or just have drinks, this is a great place.  For dinner, for the money, you might be able to do better.\n\nI've been to two parties here, and it looks really impressive.  The atmosphere alone is worth the trip for a special date night.  \n\nI've tasted/ordered many of the dishes.  They were all delicious and well made, rich but not too heavy and in perfect portions.  However, the dishes are quite pricey, and, in my opinion, not quite remarkable enough to merit it.  I think there are plenty of fine restaurants that charge a little less and wow a little more.  \n\nThe service is, well, odd.  The hostesses and bar tenders seem nice.  However, I noticed that asking even simple questions sent the servers back to the kitchen to check - when I was a server, that was pretty rare, and they had almost the same menu many months apart, so constant changes weren't to blame.  The first time, the server was nice.  The second time, the lady was just bordering on rude, and bizzarely insistent that the salad I ordered contained no avocado (even though the menu expressly listed it).  In a place that charges so much, I would have expected polite, knowledgable staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nI can't speak more highly of The House Brasserie. My husband, toddler and I came here on Christmas Day for dinner and had an incredible evening. The service was brilliant we were completely taken care of without anyone hovering over us. The food was some of the best I have had in Arizona, and the atmosphere was unique and charming. \n\nA fantastic restaurant for couples or small groups who enjoy a beautiful dining experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast night we ate at The House with a group of 16.  Food was great and Tommy our waiter was top notch.  Highly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service and ambiance were excellent.  Our server was very knowledgeable and polite, understood to ask certain questions or inform us of parts of our meals (allergies, size, level of sweetness, etc).  However, I was surprised that the food was not very good.  I started with kale salad which was diced like a slaw, and very, very over dressed.  Im assuming that was to compensate for the kale being tough, but it was absolutely dripping in dressing.  I had the chicken, which came with mustard potatoes and I added Mac and cheese.  Same thing.  The potatoes were more or less a bowl of mustard.  I was surprised they served it.  The Mac and cheese likewise was all sauce, and was underbaked (the elbows were still crunchy).  The chicken itself was over cooked, but obviously fried in oil that wasn't hot enough.  This resulted in the crunchy delicious skin being on the plate next to the chicken breast instead of sticking to it.  Overall at obvious that the restaurant uses quality ingredients but seemed to suffer from poor execution.\n\n\n\n\n\nHands down the best place to have dinner in arizona. Lindsay as our server she was beyond!!!!! So knowledgable of food and wine. Made the night. The FOOD ! Was high quality fresh and delicious. We are visiting from la and it topped some of la restaurants we frequent! Loved it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI made reservations for this place a week before, and we sat outside with a party of 6. Now the food was good, I enjoyed everything however the outside area is so cute and nice but you can't see a thing! I had to ask the server for extra candles. \n\nYou know how people say you eat with your eyes first, well I would of enjoyed the entire experience if there were more lights! I mean at least so we can see our food.\n\nWatermelon cocktail was good, I also enjoyed the brisket biscuit small plate. The broccoli soup was good, I prefer more cream based but it was still good. The rest of the party enjoyed their meals!\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here for a nice date night with my man. This place definitely lived up to the Yelp expectations. I am truly happy Yelp tool me to this gem. Now onto reviewing.\n\nThe concept of the restaurant is what kind of food you would get if you went to the Chef's house. This restaurant is 1 of 3 sister restaurants in the Valley. (The Mission and Zinc Bistro are the other two if that gives a good baseline for expectations)\n\nThe ambiance is very homey and classic. The inside has baroque wallpaper and chandwliera, and there ia an amazing patio, bigger than the inside dining area. This restaurant keeps the classic feel aince it is the second oldest house in the old town area. \n\nNow onto food.... \nI got the Lamb. It is a pasta with shredded lamb and a juicey sauce and spinach.  It was great mught have ruined all other pasta for me.\nMy bf got the rib eye. Medium rare and cooked to perfection. The whipped garlic was amazing and the best of the three sauces that it came with. \nOn the side it brings some whipped pommes (fancy mashed potatoes for us common folk) they were great but if you are sharing.. I definitely recommend taking the pasta juice and adding it to the potatoes. Yum.\n\nFor dessert we got the Chocolate boudino which is a modern take on a smore. The cookies werent spectacular but the chocolate it self with nuts was great. \n\nDrinks get the express yourself. It has a nice kaluha kick. \nAll in all.. thoroughly impressed. And had a great night.\n\n\n\n\n\nScrambled eggs are fabulous!  Yes, scrambled eggs and no, you can't make these at home!! Topped with a very tasty Bloody Mary (homemade hot sauce) ,this brunch is amazing!!! Wait staff is knowledgable and very kind.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in here this evening right when they called last call, and Keith the bartender was nice enough to pour me a good red wine and even a complementary shot of flavored whiskey. The ambiance is simply seductive. Shades of Belle Epoch Paris, with chandelier lighting, and a great drink list...I will have to come back with a date and do dinner and the whole works.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros=ambiance and service \n\nCons=Kitchen ran out of 3 different things we tried ordering.  Way over priced. Micro portions. Food wasn't really that great\n\nAll in all save your money and try somewhere else. I won't be back\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel really terrible for the review that's about to happen here, however this was a not so awesome experience and for feedback's sake it needs to be done:\n\nLast night of restaurant week, I show up with 5 friends and 2 more on the way around 8:30.\nWe're seated immediately, which was nice, however we're seated at a table with a dirty cloth (looked almost like blood on the cloth but I'm assuming it was wine). While the 5 of us are sitting in our chairs, they change the table cloth out from underneath us awkwardly. \nOur first waitress of the night comes over, we ask for restaurant week menus and waters. The menus came eventually (5-10 minutes), however it took 25 maybe 30 minutes at least to get waters. \nWe order our first rounds of drinks, they arrive quickly enough. Nice little gruyre popovers arrive at the table - yummy.\nIn this period of time we receive a new waiter, he takes drink orders for the rest of our table, and our two other friends arrive.\nThis is where things start going downhill. Two remaining friends order wine, and we all place our food orders.\nMajority of the table orders Cavatelli - some of our dishes seemed undercooked while others (mine) were cold. Still no wine for our friends.\nSecond round of food comes out a bit later, everyone at the table ordered the skirt steak. I ordered mine rare, which is next to impossible to mess up, and it was delicious. The rest of the table also received rare steaks in spite of whatever temperature they were ordered at. Still no wine for our friends. One of our friends had to send her steak back to be re-cooked, because it was not up to par. Another friend commented on how portions seemed inconsistent across the table and how they were plated differently (she got sauce, I didn't, etc.) Our waiter was also visibly upset by how poorly our service was going, which is understandable but sort of uncomfortable to witness. \nWe had to request the wine several times, maybe 3-4, before they were served -- at least a half hour after they were ordered, maybe longer, and in the middle of our dinner service.  \n\nNow, in fairness, the waiter comped a round of drinks, apologized profusely, and served a complementary kahlua shot, however as mentioned I think it's important for upper management here to understand the extent to which things were falling apart. I hope you guys get your shit together(!!), The House is walking distance from where I live, and I'd hate to see you not exist due to experiences like this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything about this restaurant was absolutely fantastic! From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, every staff member was genuinely kind in their greeting and service. I forgot the name of our waiter (Sean maybe), but he was bald and he was probably the best waiter I have ever had in my entire life! He was beyond friendly, extremely professional, and his knowledge of the dishes along with his recommendations was by far the best display by a server that I have ever seen. He could have described any dish on the menu and he would have convinced me to order it. The water was always full, the plates were cleared at the perfect time, and the check was brought at the perfect time. The server told us all about new attractions in Scottsdale, he offered to give us a hint to help with our Escape the Room activity that followed dinner (we didn't take the hint though haha), and he even kept track of time for us to make sure we arrived at our engagement on time. \n\nAs for the food, we had a melon, champagne salad that he recommended to start. It was exceptional. We ordered one of the prime rib cabs that was on special (that he highly recommended) and the lamb dish. Both were amazing. The chef also gave us complimentary Mac and cheese, which was great and these complimentary breaded appetizers filled with cheese that were also very good. The fact that the chef and waiter did this on two occasions for us just shows how classy and exceptional this place is all around. \n\nWe sat outside. The ambiance and the patio was beautiful. The music was great and at the perfect volume. The weather was perfect. I will definitely be going back and I definitely will highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good date or w nice meal!", "useful": 1.2456140350877194, "cool": 0.6090225563909775, "funny": 0.45614035087719296, "date": "2015-09-11 06:49:45"}, "15": {"business_id": "-4g68Hwm892_KPUuW5g1_Q", "business_name": "Jimmy John's", "address": "840 E Southern", "attributes": "{'HasTV': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Alcohol': \"u'none'\", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'WiFi': \"'no'\", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': \"u'casual'\", 'Caters': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': \"u'average'\", 'Ambience': \"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}\", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': \"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}\"}", "categories": "None", "city": "Tempe", "hours": "{'Monday': '10:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '10:0-0:0', 'Friday': '10:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '10:0-22:0'}", "postal_code": "85282", "review_count": 42, "stars": 2.5, "state": "AZ", "review": "Fast service. Friendly people. It's an ok deal. Very close to my work so it's a matter of convenience. I always get the Vito. And tea.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome friends and I stopped in here just before checking into a nearby hotel. I have heard good things about the franchise and I have wanted to try it for some time. We were all leas than impressed. As has been said previously, Subway is better. Very limited sandwich options. Most of us got the roast beef. There was not much meat on the sandwich and, as a whole, it was very bland. The only upside was that our food was ready very quickly, probably due to the fact that all they had to do was put on mayonnaise and meat.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatching the staff bounce around behind the counter, my first thought was -  'ah yes, the classic franchise driven by caffeinated high school students (or college students? I have difficulty discerning now in my old age...)' - then I understood where all the energy was headed...\n\nLike a small sandwich making dynamo - your order is taken and then, bam-bam, a tasty sub shoots out.  I'm stuck on the Beach Club - solid combo of cucu, avo, sprouts, turkey, and mayo - the bread is good too...  \n\nThey are sharp, efficient, and they equally have enough consideration to say 'thanks for coming...' - that goes a long way...\n\nWelcome to the neighborhood JJ...\n\n\n\n\n\nI wish they had hot subs,but other than that,heaven sent,super fast delivery.except the mill location on weekends,duh.big sandwiches w bacon,stay gold yelp\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid sandwiches and fast service. Great to get in and out with a group. Go with the beach club, tasty.\n\n\n\n\n\nI actually never have been inside this stores location but, going off of the 40 deliveries I've received, they have a 95% success rate with  correctness of order and delivery time.. They also have cured many hangovers, so thank you for having the fastest most reliable delivery ever  I tip my hat to you, jimmy!\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was quick. I'm not even sure what is on my sandwich. All I did was order. Paid money. Got change. Filled my drink. Sandwich done! Out the door like a champ...\n\n\n\n\n\nHUGE shout out to Jimmy Johns for having me pay 14 bucks for a tuna sandwich and then forgetting to put the tuna on it. Well done.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fastest jimmy john's I've been too! Great customer service and always has good recommendations for me to try\n\n\n\n\n\nGot my sandwich in no time. The place was clean and empty so it was nice to eat in on a Sunday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nworst experience of my life. \n\nI first called to order a sandwich at 9:00. 45 minutes later I call and they lost my address and my phone number. When I went ahead and told them my address, they still got \"lost\" and the girl tried to call me. I never received any calls. \n\nThen the manager (Peter Kimball) called and he said that the employee couldn't find my address. This is even after I gave them directions to my apartment. He showed up 15 min later with a sandwich that had obviously been sitting out. I threw it away when I took the first bite. I hope they see this and take action. This was one of the worst experiences that I have had. They really need to get their act together. \n\nIn two days when the store manager is in, I will give him a call but tomorrow I'm going to call corporate. \n\nI should have read the reviews, this place sucks. Take your money elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nI always get the beach club and have great service plus it's always done in about 2 or 3 mins. I come here atleast once a week or more and haven't had one bad experience. \n\nI also love to buy yesterday's bread!\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious sandwich. Disappointing service. Very Disappointing experience.  The ticket was about $3 more than I mentally added up because of up added charges. Extra $ for the 7 grain bread, extra $ for cheese, extra because they charged both sandwiches for Avocado when it was only on one sandwich. There are too many other great restaurant choices for sandwiches. I don't like feeling tricked. Buy local ... Better ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnprofessional and rude staff. I was not greeted and then when I said \"hi can I ask you a question\" the young male at the counter said \"what\". After he handed me my order I said \"thank you\" and his reply was \"yeah\".\n\n\n\n\n\nI wish they had other bread options (they have wheat BREAD but it's like as delicious as the french bread).\n\nFast service... Definitey can grab n go if you're in a rush.\n\nMy favorite is the BLT sandwich!\n\n\n\n\n\n14 employees in the joint when I showed up at 11:30am- I imagine they had delivery drivers out as well. When my party of 4 walked in we were the only patrons, and we received the traditional raucous welcome. In true JJ's fashion, I was practically thrown my sandwich nanoseconds after being handed back my credit card. Went with the #9 this time- it's going to be very hard to try anything else there with how good this was. \n\nI head-faked toward the front door prior to using the men's room to see if I could trick them into a loud goodbye. It worked. I laughed, they didn't.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are awesome! They always deliver my food right away to me and it has always been correct. It's especially convenient to order online when I get super busy at work and don't have time to go out and get a meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nI actually never have been inside this stores location but, going off of the 40 deliveries I've received, they have a 95% success rate with  correctness of order and delivery time.. They also have cured many hangovers, so thank you for having the fastest most reliable delivery ever  I tip my hat to you, jimmy! ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been ordering delivery from this location since I moved to Tempe 3 years ago. Never once have I had a bad experience, or a rude encounter by staff. Everyone is always friendly and efficient and of course the unwhich is always on point!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery rude driver. It was late. He pulled up blaring music. Made a rude comment. Maybe he should be more professional or get out of customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\nI always order from jimmy Johns, easy quick and reasonably healthy. Today my sandwich was hard as a rock, I could probably hammer a nail into wood with the bread. Gave half to my dog and tossed the other half out. Called and asked for a remade sandwich. #1, manager wanted the original sandwich back? I told her half was in my dogs belly and half was in the trash. #2Guy brought me a new sandwich, still asked for the first sandwich, as if I would go through this trouble and be deceitful over a sandwich? #3 new sandwich was just as terrible as the first. Yes Jimmy Johns. I threw it out. No I won't bother asking for another one. Keep my money.\n\nNever ordering from this Jimmy Johns again.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnprofessional and more concerned about chatting with each other than taking my order.  (There were about 10 JJ's staff there when I arrived, four or more of them on the customer side of the counter.)  The cashier had a bandaged hand and was understandably slow at making change but his slow response to take my order does not follow the \"freaky fast\" plan.  While I was waiting for my order I stood by the window and looked around at messy tables, a soda machine that needed attention and a dirty floor.  With all of that staff standing around doesn't it make sense that somebody should be cleaning?!  The one bright spot was a female employee who really seemed genuinely concerned about getting my order made and to me in a timely fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Johns is so fast, and with all that extra time I get back, I like to take my gold over to the \"i buy gold\" place right next door.\n\nTerrible joke, sorry.\n\nI dunno it's decent food, and they got crushed ice. My favorite order is a turkey tom with mustard. Check it out. :D\n\n\n\n\n\nAn $8 sandwich loaded up with old browning lettuce. Yum. Yeah right.\n\n\n\n\n\nHey! Do you love bread?? You: Why yes I do!! Do you love really stale, tasteless bread? You: Love it! Wait, do you like eating plain, bland sandwiches and cold, soggy hardly cooked bacon with just a drop of mustard so that you can't even taste it and it just seems like you're eating a dry slab of meat and bread? You: Oh my gosh, YES! That's my favorite, pile that sh*t on! Ok last question, 2 really bad cafeteria quality sandwiches and the delivery driver will forget part of your order and have to come back, around $25.00 seem fair?? You: Totally! \n\nOk then, Jimmy John's has you covered!! \n\nOh. And by the way. If you ever deliver me food again and don't bring me NAPKINS, I will have your soul!!! \n\nI'm out. (Drops mic)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they get your order wrong and have to remake it, they WILL use the same bread.\n\nExample: sandwich contains mustard, so you ask them to remake it. They will simply use the same bread and scrape off the mustard. \n\nLuckily I'm not allergic to mustard, otherwise that would be a lawsuit waiting to happen. At least the bread was fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecided to go out of the way and go to this particular location. Was greeted with a rude \"what do you want?\" Every table was dirty. There was soda spilled on the floor and was already to the point that it was sticky. Overall worst Jimmy Johns experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrove there to pick up sandwiches for the office.  Got to the office and they got the order wrong.  Called to let them know and my secretary drove back over.  They acted like she was inconveniencing them, no \"We're sorry,\" let alone even an offer of a free bag of chips or a drink.  Disappointed.  Shows poor management, training, lack of true customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy John's is what a basic standard sandwich should taste like. It's better than subway and Quiznos but there are better places out there and the food is kind of bland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis location is NOT \"freaky fast\". I order from here when I am at work and it always takes about 30-40 min to get my one sandwich. The location by my home in Ahwatukee delivers in 10-15 minutes. 20 at the most. \n\nBut as always, the subs are delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nANY JJ location, Corporate or Franchise, that refuses my request for Hot Peppers , on the side, will .....\n\nsee me do an about-face, and watch MY BUNS walk out the door..\n\n\n\n\n\nMeh, Subway is better.  I'd rather go there and pick all the toppings I want, instead of being limited to the FEW toppings offered at Jimmy John's.  Plus, I always hear their ads advertising how fast they are, but when I went there last night my sandwich took a pretty long time to make!  At least 5 minutes.... definitely enough time for me to read that entire Dave Barry poster on the wall.\n\nI will say that I like their bread better than Subway bread, but it's not enough to compensate for the other deficiencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nTried it for the first time this week. My sub was tasty but just a roastbeef and cheese sub on a cursty roll. Can't figure out what all the rage over this chain is about. It's fast service which is great when you need food fast. But it's a little over priced sandwhich and fountain drink both. My lunch was $8.  The place is clean but not really inviting as 90% of the customers take it to go or eat at an outdoor table.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was at this local Jimmy Johns and below is what happened. You might think I am being a pain but I defend myself in the below emails. \n\nThe sandwiches are great. I was grading this based upon lack of satisfying the customer.   \n\nThomas\n\nBelow is Jimmy's reasoning:\n\n\"I serve the people that serve you. The proper way to serve on the side is a plastic 2 oz cup and lid. The cost of the cup and lid is 32 cents. In order for me to pay employees, insurance, rent, utilities, overhead and interest on the loan for that store I'd have to charge $1.20 and I would make a dime. I made the decision that my customers would yell at me either way, but I made the call that you would yell at me more for charging $1.20 for peppers on the side as opposed to providing them at no additional cost by putting them either on or off, not on the side\" Hope this clears it up for you bro, Jimmy\n\nHeather\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather\n\nDoesn't make any sense on 2 points\n\n1 Let the customer have it they ways they like it ( The juice from the hot peppers end up drenching into the sandwich and it tastes like a hot vinegar sandwich)\n2 Consistency.... All operations should be a mirror image of each other. \n\nYou might think I am being petty on this but when I go into a eating establishment I want it my way. If I asked for my mayo or oil & vinegar on the side it is not allowed even if I offer to pay extra?\nI know food establishments are working on thin margins and I realize that extra condiments cut into the bottom line. But if  a customer offers  to \" pay extra \" and it is not allowed it does not make any sense. \nIf JJ had charged me 50 to 75 cents more for my request it would have been pure profit. Please help me understand why JJ has made this decision when a customer offers to pay extra......... \n\n\n\nFrom: JJ Feedback [mailto:jimmyjohn@jimmyjohns.com] \nSubject: RE: Jimmy Johns Feedback Form Submission\n\nTom\n\nThank you for taking the time to write.\n\nThe information you received is correct, our corporate locations no longer offer peppers on the side.

I said I would pay for them and I was told that because they were a corporate store they could not do this. I thought I did not hear the manager correctly and I asked him to repeat himself. What happened to having a sandwich the way I like it? I canceled the order and went to Jersey Mikes. I used to frequesnt Jimmy Johns 1 to 2 times a week until that day. I have not entered a Jimmy Johns since then and I tell freinds and aqquantances what happened. Please tell me if the manager was correct in his statement.....

Southern \nEmail \"Jimmy Johns Feedback Form Submission\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCrappy service coupled with really bad sandwiches they make subway look like gourmet.  It's no wonder there's never a line at that place\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here to get my wife a quick sub to eat for her while she was on lunch. I asked for a Beach Club and I was charged a beach club. My wife tested me and told me that their was no meat at all. I looked up on the menu and the beach club has turkey and etc. I called the store and spoke to Zach and he said they would fix it for me. I arrive at the store around 6pm and they \"manager\" (cough)cough) told me they could not do nothing about what happened. They basically started a full blown argument with me. I showed them my receipt and still nothing was done. When I asked for a coperate number I was told to Google the number. I asked for names and they all stayed quiet. I will NEVER come here or eat at any Jimmy John's ever. I the people here were rude, obnoxious and didn't care about my problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've heard some people really rave about this place. They were so excited went Jimmy John's came to the valley. My review is based on a single experienced but it was definitely sub par. \n\nAm I the only one that has had a need for napkins or extra condiments? With the 7, count 'em, 7 kids in the sandwich preparation area and maybe 3 customers I was confused why when my girlfriend asked for napkins at the register, the girl told her they were at the other end.....literally like 5 feet away. So we walked 5 feet down and asked a different girl standing there and received napkins.\n\nWent outside, sat down and realized there wasn't mustard on my sandwich. Went back inside and asked for some, \"We don't have any.\" Yeah they don't have any salt, pepper, mayo, mustard or any self serve condiments. You have to get those things when it's being made. Weak. \n\nThe bread was fresh, everything was really, but it was no where near an amazing sandwich. I'll probably try it out again but at least I'll know what I'm getting, an okay sandwich.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsed to frequent this place when I lived in Arizona. Fast delivery and even better sandwiches. Love the beach club.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't get all the hype - this is a good sandwich at a good price. Though I like the vibe and the attitude reflected in their decor and promotional materials, but the product itself is nothing miraculous. I gotta say I love me a tuna sub now and they - it pains me to say that lowly Subway blows this tuna out of the water.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwhelming on your first visit if you don't know what you want to order.  No kid meals.  You can't have anything \"on the side\".  I wasn't overly impressed with any aspect of the experience or food but it was okay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time I went in there I was baffled by the menu. I am used to the typical Subway experience where you're in a line, telling them condiment by condiment what you'd like. This place was different. Their menu already has a classic combination of ingredients stuffed into their bread. \n\nSo I ordered the #1 - Pepe (Ham & Provolone basically). While I was sure I would like the combination, but isn't a sandwich shop always about the bread? Well, that's my opinion. And I have to say, their bread is lacking in my opinion. It's that tough bread that can't really be that good unless you have steel teeth & an iron jaw to chew it with. I just don't dig chewy bread. The service was great. They immediately attended to me and took my order, but the food itself, I just wasn't impressed with the bread.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've given this place a few chances to prove themselves and every time I am disappointed. The staff is rude, their sandwiches are usually made wrong, and they charged me for avocado and didn't put any in my sandwich. I have yet to have a good experience from this place. Plus their sandwich selection sucks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my worst customer service experiences, period, happened here. I have been a fairly regular JJ's customer for about 12 years now and my only bad experience ever was here. They got my togo order wrong and then refused to refund me for the petty $6. \n\nInstead of refunding my card they offered to deliver a replacement. I told them on the phone that the sandwich was mostly eaten, since I was hungry and it was not an allergen issue, and I would rather have the refund. However they told me they can only do exchanges and since I have never had a problem at any JJ's I do not have prior knowledge of their policy on such things.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later the delivery person (apparently the general manager?) arrived and when he saw the partially eaten sandwich he got a pretty bad attitude.

Spending $10+ to save a $6 refund does not make very good business sense. Additionally, since they did not actually fix the problem and were just asinine, they wasted their time and money and still lost a customer at their location for life.", "useful": 0.6511627906976745, "cool": 0.32558139534883723, "funny": 0.5116279069767442, "date": "2014-07-27 00:11:18"}, "16": {"business_id": "-4w2eZqQJcS-UNuB1lCPFA", "business_name": "Subway", "address": "1561 N Cooper Rd", "attributes": "{'RestaurantsAttire': \"'casual'\", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}\", 'Caters': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Alcohol': \"'none'\", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'WiFi': \"'free'\", 'Ambience': \"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}\", 'NoiseLevel': \"'loud'\", 'GoodForMeal': \"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}\", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'DriveThru': 'False'}", "categories": "None", "city": "Gilbert", "hours": "None", "postal_code": "85233", "review_count": 5, "stars": 3.0, "state": "AZ", "review": "They messed up my sandwich and I didn't realize until I had left the store that it was still cold in the center.

Definitely a huge jerk and pretty dumb. They messed up my sandwich again in the same way (which I think might be down to the way they are preparing the chicken compared to other subways) so I just had him microwave it this time. \n\nOh I also asked for a medium drink and he just gave me a large and said that it was a medium.

Worried that maybe there was a robbery or something, I began asking loudly, \"hello, is anyone around\"? I left & drove around the back of the store, around the corner from the tattoo place & there was the staff in the alley, looking at their cell phones. I sat there for several minutes before they went in. Mr. Owner...you're losing allot if $$ here. Appalling...\n\n\n\n\n\nMm. Sandwiches. I think this is a very good Subway. It smells like freshly baked bread. They are very polite and the food is very fresh.

The place is big, the staff was friendly, the bar area was pretty nice, and they had a lot of TV's playing the Cardinal's game. I could totally buy this place as a sports bar. \n\nNow, on to everything else.... \n\nThe parking situation is abysmal, but hey, that's Avondale for ya... I won't blame this restaurant for the shrieking baby, that blame goes squarely on the shoulder of the parents who were busy getting their drank on. \n\nWe ordered: \nApps: Onion Rings / Friend Mushrooms / Moz Sticks\nEntree: Steak & Cheese sandwich, the \"special\" calzone, and the lasagna. \nWell, we didn't order the lasagna at first, of the 10 things listed in the pasta section it was the only thing available that wasn't spaghetti and meatballs. \n$50.00 for the check, this included drinks & a mediocre tip. \n\nThe appetizers came to the table, and as soon as I saw the fried mushrooms I had a bad feeling. \n\nEverything was perfectly shaped and colored. This is because everything certainly came out of a freezer bag 5 minutes ago. The moz sticks were flavorless, the onion rings were perfectly round onion flavored bread rings, and the fried mushrooms were an undercooked disaster of batter, covering the world's smallest mushrooms. \n\nI'm not a super Italian food enthusiast, the kind that expects it to taste like it came from a Tuscan village. I just wanted something that tasted less like fried batter, and more like FOOD. \n\nMy wife said the Steak & Cheese was OK. The meat and cheese components were tasty enough, but the previously frozen roll was undercooked and doughy. \n\nThe lasagna was rough, Stouffer's puts out a similar product in the frozen food section of Fry's, so save yourself some money and try that if you want, because this was just not good. No seasoning, bland cheese mix, and straight from the jar sauce that was almost too sweet. \n\nThe calzone, the Palermo's Special Calzone, was sadly also from frozen, and I can't let it go! (see what I did there?) It was perfectly shaped, and the outside was crispy, however, like all frozen entrees of this caliber, it was a soggy nightmare on the bottom. Inside it was watery and nasty. No taste, horrible \"cheese\" filling, and the same disgusting sauce that the lasagna was made with. No Bueno. \n\nThe waitstaff was nice, if not a little absent after food delivery, but the food was abysmal. I'm a fat guy who loves to eat, and this had me rethinking everything.\n\nI can tell you that #1 Brothers is right down the road, if you want a better Italian ANYTHING, go there, cause damn.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood pizza and great hot wings! New owners work their butts off and are super friendly. I recommend this place for sure. I just wish they would add Buffalo Shrimp to their menu!\n\n\n\n\n\nPalermo's is our favorite place to go for pizza and wings. New owners are very nice too! We go there every other Friday evening. Last night we brought s bunch of friends from church and used the meeting room. Everyone had a great time! I hope this place is a success!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the choice between the pizza here or a $5 dollar one from a chain, decided to give Palermos a try. Wrong choice! The price to quality ratio was just completely off. You really do not get what you're paying for, but hey the kids loved it so what the hell. Will try it again, but will not stray away too far from the pizza. The first thing that I noticed was that the pizza was very greasy. Greasy pizza, which is no problem if combined with pizza that has flavor, but the flavor here was completely lacking and greasy pizza without the flavor is no good. I kept eating just to see if it would improve. It did not. Like I said, I will try it again, so don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwful undercooked.  Got the runs from one piece.  Paid $22 for large crappy pizza that got me sick.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally good pizza and wing specials.very affordable.cheezy tasty pizza.appetizers good and not expensive.if your a beer drinker they make the best michelada this side of the border.highly recommended.great for family and kids\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my new go to pizza and wings joint.

We sat in a booth in the bar area and the service was great.  They've got a great wine list and the menu has a great varied selection - something for everyone.  For us, we just enjoyed lots of appetizers.  The spinach artichoke dip and the bruschetta sample platter were terrific and moderately priced.  It was a great place to spend an hour or two after a long day.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying to be nice since we moved from the Columbus, Oh, the home of Brio/Bravo/Lyndeys(founder) etc.\n\nIn the few months we have been here, we have had dinner, carryout and happy hour.   It does not seem to be the same quality food and attention to detail in any of the 3.  The worst is the \"happy hour\" food which per other posts is inferior quality.  The portions are just right and the prices are great but if the food sucks so what's the point?   Also, they broadcast Happy Hour but the bottle of wine was full price and we were not given other choices.The carpacio is always excellent and not bad at happy hour as well but everything else is salty, greasy and lacks the freshness and zip that I can't believe I am saying, from the midwest locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio has great service and very friendly staff. The food quality is a bit inconsistent depending on what day you visit. It's a great family place and the portions are large so expect to have leftovers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I have been to Brio 3 times. All three times the wine was served HOT. Not warm, room temp. HOT. Each time the waitress acknowledged the fact and asked us if we would like a \"side of ice\". Are you kidding me!? When I asked if they receive a lot of comments on the wine, she replied \"yes, but usually ice helps\". On to the food..... average is about the best it can be rated. We have tried the restaurant 3 times just to be fair. Too many managers, servers, bartenders running around to have mediocre service and average food. Three strikes on this place...\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a beautiful place, went for happy hour great prices, nice portion sizes, beautiful presentation, the staff was friendly an attentive, the food tasted amazing, couldn't of asked for a nicer time, the chef was amazing, very professional, would definatly recommend this place an take out of town guests... Loved it!!\n\n\n\n\n\nService was atrocious when we visited. Shame too. Because we generally loved Brio when we lived in Denver. Perhaps the customer service standards are different in CO from AZ.\n\n\n\n\n\nI met a friend here for lunch, and we ordered the soup and salad, the Bistecca\n salad, and minestrone soup, really good price, and the salad was chilled, it was delicious, the soup was pretty good too, I think I like Olive Garden's Minestrone better, my girlfriend says their Happy Hour is really great also !\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing service, excellent food, definitely will let everyone I know, locals and visitors to not look any further than Brio for an excellent meal. Brio has really met and exceeded my expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here for lunch today with a friend.\n\nThe marlin special sounded good so we both ordered it.\n\nNot such a great idea.  The marlin was overcooked.  My friend said it tasted like chicken.  The roasted veggies were just ok as well.\n\nNext time I'll stick with one of the pasta dishes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food here is delicious! The lasagna bolognese exceeded all my expectations and more! It was one of the best lasagnas I've had in my life!! My husband got a pasta with a creamy red bell pepper sauce, and he enjoyed it as well. The creme brle was very good as well! I look forward to trying more dishes!\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue italian rustic, like most Italians this place stuffs you with a ton of food. Breads, salad, main course and dessert...you won't leave hungry.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW!!! What an experience! If you visit Brio ASK for ASHLEY! She will make you feel like royalty. True Tuscan culture and atmosphere. Absolutely love this place! The service is what really stands out! An amazing experience!!! Thank you Ashley!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy son and now wife held their informal wedding in the private dining room on 10/20. Everything was great.  The event coordinator got everything arranged according to their wishes.  All of the guests enjoyed their meals which were prepared and presented very nicely.  The servers did a great job, especially considering all of the mingling guests they had to take care of.  The private room was perfect for the occasion.  Thank you to all involved! Char\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is what it is. A very pretty chain Italian restaurant. If you are looking for authentic or out of the box original, don't go here. If you are looking for solid, safe Italian American fare, this is your place. There was nothing wrong but nothing outstanding either, oh, except the butter, it was awesome. And to Jason B., all the shrimp that we get in Arizona is frozen. All of it!\n\n\n\n\n\nThree of us dined. I had a whole roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies was excellent. Of course, I could not eat a whole thing. My son really enjoyed ravioli w/ tasty sauce. My wife had crab cakes which was good. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Do I go back again? Yes, definitely.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was ok, but the service was POOR at best. Only 8 tables with customers at the time and they couldn't handle basic service. Our waiter poured our waters and asked what we wanted to eat. He took our order and disappeared. We flagged him down after 5 minutes or so and asked for some bread. He said it was still being made then disappears for another 10 minutes, shows up with our 2 entree salads and a chicken Marsala and said the bread is almost done.  2 minutes later he drops off the bread and disappears for the rest of our meal. He never asked for our drink order, didn't check on us during our meal, or even refilled our waters.I asked for the manager and explained what our experience was like so far. He apologized and said he would be right back to refill our waters, which he did. Even though we told the manager that our waiter never took our drink order, HE didn't even care to know what else we might want to drink besides water. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured Brio was out of sodas, teas, coffees, beers, wines, and liquor for the rest of the weekend. They offered us free dessert, but at that point we were just done.  Remember, this was when there were only 8 tables that were occupied. I can only imagine what the service would be like if the place were slammed, but then again maybe that's why the place was empty on a Sunday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio was the 1st leg of our progressive dinner last night (8-14-2013)  It was my dining companions birthday celebration and he had never been before.  I chose Brio for appetizers.  We were greeted promptly and seated.  I had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day to drop off a birthday card and flowers for our table.  At that time I explained that we were only having app's there and moving on to another restaurant for our main course and a 3rd for dessert. All was well when we were seated, card and orchid in place (whew).  I ordered the Carpaccio and the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant for appetizers.  Wonderful was the food and service.  Until the server offered a dessert for the birthday boy.  Just an oversight, but all was well.  Thank you to Brio for making it a great start to our evening!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nreally good food & a good bar.  the location is good too.  definitely gone back numerous times.  parking is a bit of a pain, but not horrible and they have valet, although i think valet is the biggest scam around.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was awesome as always. However, this is the second time I've sat in the bar and had the bartender as my server. He is awful!! I asked for my check and it took him 10 minutes to bring it to me and then it took him another 5 minutes to pick it up. I was on my lunch break so I was in a bit of a hurry and he just didn't care. He did this the last time I was there too. Just awful service...\n\n\n\n\n\nWe discovered this one after shopping the west elm, and stopped in for a snack, had the meatballs, which were tasty, and served with polenta, which we liked, Decided to come back and try the happy hour, had their burger, really good, shrimp cocktail, not that interesting, more meatballs, still liked them, and the service was efficient if not overly warm, The place looks like an Italian version of the Cheesecake factory, all big and fancy and chainlike, but the food is definately pretty good, so we ll go back and try dinner soon,\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a nice lunch here today.  The food was really tasty and they had some nice, healthier options instead of all really heavy stuff with huge portions.  I had a 5 oz filet with some yummy vegetables in a balsamic sauce.  My 3 1/2 year old liked it, too, it was kid friendly.  The service was good and the staff was friendly.  We would definitely come back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to LOVE this place since we were planning to reserve a room for our daughters birthday but we've had a change of heart. While our server was a bit slow, which was understandable since it was a busy night. But my husband's order(short rib) was frozen! Seriously frozen inside. How does a restaurant charge $20 something for a frozen meal?! This place is nothing but an overpriced Olive Garden. Without the awesome soup and bread!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I love the atmosphere at Brio Tuscan Grille.  Upon walking in the door we were greeted by five smiling friendly faces at the hostess desk.  As a hostess walked us into the dining room I asked her to seat us at a booth, which was not a problem since It was early in the evening.  Our waitress was just as friendly. We ordered two appetizers and savored every bite of the crab and shrimp cakes and gorgonzola lamb chops...YUM!! (These appetizers are also listed on the menu as entrees.) My husband ordered a fish special as his entree.  I don't recall the fish name though our waitress explained it was similar to sea bass.  So far everything we ordered was perfectly cooked...moist with plenty of blended flavors.  The entree I ordered was spicy shrimp with orzo and vegetables. The veges were tender though the shrimp was a bit over cooked. I'm crazy about orzo...this was extremely oily. After several bites I gave up on trying to justify the oiliness.  This wasn't our first time at Brio and certainly not our last. Their menu has so many scrumptious sounding items I'm getting hungry writing about them!\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio is on my list at least once every 3 months. It's my go-to choice when out of town friends come for a visit.\n\nAlways spot on no matter the menu choices.\n\nAlways spot on service - top notch. The same caliber as restaurants that charge far more.\n\nI have yet to find any item on their dinner menu that is less than perfect. I like that there are many choices always so well prepared. That's part of why I like this place so much. All too often, it's easy to find a \"go-to\" for visitors where you end up having the exact same meal time after time. Boring.\n\nDefinitely going to go back. Again, and again.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the worst service ever. Sat for 45 minutes with no bread or inquiry of our food order. Finally ordered food including flatbread. 20 mins later manager can over (who has since disappeared after multiple attempts for his reappearance) and told us they had no thawed dough. Seriously. It's Friday night at 8:30. \nHad to ask for bread again. Had to ask for food more than an hour in when all other tables had been fed. \nAsked for manager again. Assuming he slipped out the back. \nFood fine. Horrible service.\n\nComments stand. Since writing, Brio did the right thing. New manager Larry comped everything. Other manager never reappeared. Bad experience but they do the right thing. Thank you Larry.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a crazy busy 'day after Christmas' restaurant hunting expedition, our family in Scottsdale took us to Brio.  The food was all-around excellent, and the appetizers were out of this world.  The spinach dip and beef/shrimp appetizers were particularly memorable.  \n\nAn extra star for being so kid-friendly!   Our children were crazy/screaming by the time we were finally seated, and the waiters pushed the kids orders through quickly to maintain our sanity.  Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad such an amazing experience here last week. \n\nDined here after early day from work with my best friend and my grand parents. We had appetizers, lunch (nana and I had pastas, zach and my papa had sandwiches, we had deserts (lava cake, cheesecakes, and tiramisu, wine, and coffee) and the entire meal was exceptional.\n\nLunch was super busy, but they always kept an eye on us and made sure we were well taken care of. \n\nI have always had an amazing experience at Brio and love it there. Check it out for date night or for a nice family dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of the major new restaurants in my area, I've been wanting to try Brio since it opened, and I'm glad I did - I was very pleased!\n-- Roasted red pepper and mozzarella bruschetta was very good...my only complaint is that it could have used a little more balsamic, and the mozz was a little greasy. I personally would have done a mix of mozz and goat cheese but, hey, I'm not the chef.\n-- Chopped salad was okay...chopped lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, olive, and feta in a nice, light dressing\n-- Pasta alla vodka...highly recommended! tortellini stuffed with ricotta in a spicy tomato cream sauce, with basil, crispy prosciutto, and garlic for that special added kick of flavor that makes this dish unique\n-- Chicken limone...your standard picatta, but with two huge breasts of chicken and a side of yummy pasta (although the pasta was a little cold)\n-- \"Dolchinos\"...small servings of desserts...we tried the key lime pie, which was yummy, but it was the bananas foster creme brulee that evoked a WOW!\nAll-in-all, I'm very pleasantly surprised by this chain restaurant. Lovely dining room, attentive service, and great food at moderate prices (figure $25-30 per person).\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for the first time with my lady at her request.  Nice ambiance, Overwhelmingly delicious food and presentation by the chefs.   We started with the insalata caprese, which was fresh with a very balanced dressing for the greens that came atop the salad.  I had the crab crusted salmon and basically wiped the plate clean.  She had the sweet potato chicken risotto, which she found to be delectable.   Our only qualm was that the service was underwhelming to say the least.   It should never take 20 minutes to get water on a table, our server never checked back on food satisfaction, and we had to grab another employee to check us out when we were finished with dinner.   For as staffed as the restaurant was, the front of house did a major disservice to the kitchen for the evening.    5 stars for food, 1 star for service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to this restaurant few weeks ago.  The food was great including the desserts.  The service was very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for lunch. Was good food. Took long time. Our waitress was very out of it and smelled\nLike alcohol. Kind of amusing but had we been needing to be somewhere I would have been really mad. Hopefully the managers look at these.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great experience we had at lunch today at Brio Tuscan Grill at Scottsdale Quarter. Our server Scott was very professional and service was great. It was extra special when the Executive Chef Joe Milbert came to see if we were satisfied with our meal and if we needed anything. Bravo for Brio. Recommending to my friends to frequent this establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing: optimistic, results-oriented, curious, innovative, and adaptable people work here and make excellent suggestions on food. I always get the best service and food here. Our friend complemented the Moscow mule made by Sara: very sweet and talented bar tender. The manager is pleasant as can be and booths are ambient and comfy. Thanks Brio and keep doing amazing work on pleasing our taste buds\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent time for 3 couples to dine and catch up.\nWe had may great entrees and some outstanding wine.\n\nOr only challenge was that they had a great fish special and 2 of our party was told at 5:55pm that it was sold out.  so for a weekday the specials are suspect.\n\nThe service was kind and attentive.  The value was good and great taste in the food.\nWorth  the drive from Tempe\nTom\n\n\n\n\n\nWe come here all the time for happy hour and normally have amazing service.  However this time we had Danny R as our server.  He failed to refill waters after asking a few times.  Was to busy chatting with servers to drop a glass of wine at our table while holding it for at least 5 mins.   Asked us 30 mins after we got our food if it was ok bc we didn't eat much of.  Then we waited another 10 mins for our bill.  All in all the service this time was subpar to previous visits.\n\nAfter note I speak with the manager he credited the bill back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I walked in I felt like I was in a restaurant in the Venetian or Balaggio hotel. Realy nice and the host staff and waiters gave the best service you cuould possibly get. I ordered the homemade tortellini stuffed with a ricotta mixture covered in a pink vodka sauce. The dish was right on, 5 stars for this dish alone. I only wish there were a few more tortellini cause i could have eaten them till i exploded. Anyway dad got the pork chops topped with gorgonzola . He loved them. My mom and girlfriend got the steak topped with hollidaise. They both liked that but the steaks were over done a bit. They had a huge party they served before us and think our steaks were forgotten about and were a little over cooked. We told the waitress and they took both dishes off the bill and gave us free dessert. We got the dessert sampler and molten lava cake. Freakin unreal desserts. I will be back I would have given them 3 stars cause of the over cooked steaks but they made up for that in a big way and I will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo these stars are for the way my complaint was handled. After waiting three days for someone to contact me I decided to call and ask to speak to a GM, he was not in and I spoke to Adam who is a manager. Adam refunded my charge, invited me back with a guest for a meal, but MOST IMPORTANT,  listened to me and apologized for my experience last weekend. I will come back and give this Brio another try. This is how my situation should have been handled that night. This is customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Brio for dinner early Sat. night. They were on a wait (of course) so we opted to sit in the Lounge. (I have heard  that they offer an awesome happy hour, apps are $2.95. I am looking forward to returning and taking advantage of that!)  Anyways.. This is my second time here and both times I have ordered the Pasta Alla Vodka. Absolutely Delicious!! It was so good, I don't want to venture out and try anything else on the menu!  Our server was great. It was a wonderful experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nGirl's night out! Movies and Happy Hour at Brio.  The misters were going so we sat outside.  We were quickly seated and offered water and drinks. We ordered wine, 3 orders of pepper shrimp, flatbread, a burger, carpaccio, and tomato and mozzarella.  The wait staff is awesome.  People watching is fun.  Happy Hour is simply delish !  Everything was excellent and plentiful.  Our server was happy to give us separate checks and to go boxes.  A wonderful experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nYum! Always got the steak salad here and after moving away I had to go back when I visited.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter recently returning from Italy I discovered the Brio Tuscan Grill while shopping at the Apple Store.  With a new appreciation for Italian food I tried the Risotto and Insalata on the lunch menu.  \n\nThe Bistecca Insalata (a quarter cut of head lettuce and creamy ranch dressing with tomatoes and bacon) was crispy and tasty.  It could almost make a meal by itself with a glass of red Tuscan wine along with the seed filled crackers for extra taste.\n\nThe Risotto with Shrimp and Scallop was a small but adequate portion.  A little more flavor but not nearly the size nor quality of fresh shellfish I had along the waterfront in the Fishing Village below the town of Sorrento.\n\nAll in all a good new spot for lunch on the patio as fall finally approaches the Valley of the Sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food. Not your traditional Italian menu. I bit pricey, but large portions. Service was excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food here was fantastic. Came in with my family of 5 on Saturday evening. Had to wait a few minutes for a table, no big deal, as a party of 11 came in before us. We got seated near the bar in a large booth, but the table was itty bitty. Especially for 5 adults. \n\nBy checking in on Yelp, I received a free appetizer. We got the Margherita Flatbread, and it was delicious! Rather big, perfect for sharing - enough for all of us. I can't remember everything that everyone ordered, but my mom and I split the Grilled Salmon Salad and it was SO good! Splitting it was perfect size; they do offer 1/2 sizes on the salads. All of the food came out very quick as well. \n\nOur server wasn't the best, he was very slow, and not good with recommendations. It felt as though he didn't want to accommodate my brothers request to change sauce on one of the pastas, as it took away from the taste or something like that he said. He was also very, very slow. He was too busy leaning against the counter by the computer at the end of the bar, drinking his beverage, and flirting with another server. We had to ask the manager to refill our drinks. \n\nThe restaurant it pretty large, very clean, and well decorated. The bar is rather big too, and they have a few TV in there. I will definitely come back here next time I am in town.\n\n5 stars if the service was better.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boyfriend and I decided to eat here after attending the hello kitty event. Haha. \n\nFor appetizer, I had the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip with Parmesan flatbread. Honestly, I was so full after that. I didn't even want my entre anymore. Haha. But as my entre, I ordered the Ravioli Di Bello. Which had portobello, mushrooms, grape tomatoes in it. It was very creamy but hard to eat.\n\nThe service was so slow. Our drinks took forever, I asked for napkins and it took almost 15 minutes for me to get, same goes to the to go box as well.\n\nThe ambiance was nice, the decor and set up is  like Cheesecake Factory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be a great restaurant IF you order right.  I previewed the menu and reviews first and had the shrimp and eggplant appetizer as my meal.  It's heavy, but oh so good!  I'm kind of a vegetarian except I won't give up seafood. And, I LOVE eggplant so this was perfect for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy doesn't yelp allow half stars.  This is really a 3.5 restaurant.  Typical higher end Italian chain.  Food was ok but not exciting.  Was I expecting any thing different? Service was good.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst ever! Filing complaint waitress was horrific the worse experience ever another couple was just as ready to leave as us. Very sad people can be so rude\n\n\n\n\n\nSat at the bar couch for 15 minutes.  Bartenders and hostess walked by us 3 times not even a glance! Wow.  Horrible.  Got up and left to Mexican food place across the street.  Unbelievable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWaited over an out just for our food. Service wasn't great. My pasta came out looking very dry, as if it was sitting out on the counter for awhile. Sent it back as I was not able to eat it. 2 minutes later it came back to the table. Same pasta, just some extra sauce mixed in. Lobster was very mushy. This is the second time I have visited, and I will not return. First time I had a 2\" long bone in my food, and the waitress told me that I \"now have a tooth pick for after my meal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSalmon was great  \nService excellent \nLocal beer, ill try again \nThis guys never disappoint, this is the care that you get in a family owned restaurant with the highest everything\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is good, Service though definitely needs improvement!!  This was my second time here, and unfortunately I'd have a tough time coming back.  Even for happy hour.  (which is a pretty good happy hour).  Our server, (Alecia G.) might have just been having an off day, but as mentioned above my previous visit, was a male server, who had no clue how to describe the food, or to suggestive sell on martini's and or cocktails.  This visit though was on a slower night, and I expected better service, than just having to ask for water refill (it is hot in AZ... you'd think water would be almost a given each time I got a cocktail).  We had to ask for the 4th place setting when our food came, and by the time we got that, the flatbread pizza was cold, and pasta the same.  At least there are other restaurant options in the direct area, (SOL, Eddie V's, etc)\n\n\n\n\n\nMy guests and I were seated and we asked for bread, as one couple had just gotten off a plane and they  were starved.  We got it 20 minutes later after asking 3 more times and threatening to leave.\n\nThe Calamari appetizer was the worst ever.  50% of the plate (not exagearting) was old breading, and the calamari was tough and overcooked.\n\nI ordered the Shrimp Risotto, which used to come with shrimp and scallops.   No more scallops.  But of course they raised the price on the dish anyway.   Welcome to new American dining.   Cut the food.  Raise the prices.\n\nBrio presents a nice atmosphere because it was physically well designed.  Problem is, they forgot to hire anyone who can cook or provide nice table service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWonderful place for lunch or dinner.  The service is fast and friendly.  The menu has all different types of choices including a wonderful gluten free menu! If you like beef carpaccio there's is the best I've  had by far.  Phoebe our server was very attentive and cheerful and the manger even stopped by to see how everything was going:).  I will definitely be back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has not disappointed me in the 5 years I have been going there.   Their happy hour is excellent, dinner menu is great and the service is always very good.  My server this time was Vivianne and she went beyond the call of duty, had incredible manners, very friendly with great suggestions about the food.  I am truly impressed\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this restaurant! Come here every time I'm in Scottsdale. I like the food and the prices!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a great time at Brio the server Max was on top of everything very friendly and the manager Joe was very gracious and welcoming. We had ordered the lobster tail shrimp and risotto was an epicurean delight   We all 6 plan on returning soon and will be hosting a birthday party soon and plan on taking our friends there.\n\n\n\n\n\nStick to the pastas, everything else is poorly prepared. Dried up chicken and overpriced steaks. Prices do not reflect the food quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of our favorite places for Italian food!!! Such a good fancy dinner for a reasonable price. Our waitress Samantha was clearly trained well and super personable. She did such a great job and made the experience fantastic!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite spots as it has the trifecta of great ambiance, service, and food. \n\nDuring my last visit, our server recommended the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant* appetizer, and with good reason too! . It was amazingly flavorful, saucy, and peppery. By the way, saucy means having the ability to mop it up with the complimentary bread!\n\nAs far as entrees go, my two favorites are the Pasta Alla Vodka* (this was also recommended by our server) and the Fettuccine Napoli. I'm a bacon lover and these both have pancetta ;) The Seared Shrimp Risotto* and Citrus Chicken* both have great but simpler flavors in comparison to the previously mentioned menu items. I hate to say anything negative about this place, but the shrimp in the risotto was most definitely seared as described, but a bit on the tasteless side as well.\n\nDuring my first visit, we tried the bread pudding dessert.. To this day I still fondly think of it and often imagine the next time we will meet again. I'll be damned if you find a better bread pudding!\n\nLast but not least, the bellinis are awesome! I definitely recommend the peach bellini over the raspberry bellini as the raspberry is a generic kind of fruity and the peach is just... peachy :)\n\nWhile I've been to better Italian restaurants, this place is amazing in terms of location and bang for your buck.\n\n* = check out my photos!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to Brio last night with 4 friends, the food was great and our waiter Carlos was great. The peach Belini was very good, the salads and main courses were prepared just right. We used to go to Bravos in Pittsburgh, Brio is the same menu and good food. We will be back very soon and ask for Carlos.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are so many better choices in the local area.  The food is bland and the service is slow.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have to say the whole reason I give this restaurant 5 stars is because of our server Adrian- he was so personable and friendly!! He catered to our large party and was very consistent with his service, I really appreciate a restaurant that hires someone like him who truly cares about our experience. I will be back thanks to him!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I have been to this restaurant 3 times and dont know if we'll go again. Brio has potential as noted by our first dining experience but it seems to have gotten worse each time thereafter. We noticed the sauces have become watered down with smaller portions and when we called them on it we were told they do that for the happy hour crowd but we were in the dining room for dinner. They did replace the dish with the correct sauce and portions but we still felt as though they were trying to pull one over on us. When your spending more than $50 on a meal for two nothing should be watered down. The service which was amazingly good when they first opened has also slipped and we found ourselves feeling somewhat neglected at times with a forgetful waiter. Consequently, I've noticed we dont seem as motivated to visit them on date night anymore. Hope management cleans up their act.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I like about Olive Garden and Carrabba's is they know who they are.  They're chain restaurants that give you an OK meal at an average price.\n  \nBrio is a chain that tries to be a classy local Italian restaurant but they don't live up to that. Don't get me wrong, the food is OK, the decor is beautiful and the restaurant is huge (thus taking away from the classy local restaurant feel).\n\nI started with the calamari which was a bit soggy and came with two sauces that were spooned over about half of the serving. What if I didn't like the sauces? Ask for the sauce on the side.\n\nFor my main course I had what was advertised as Shrimp and Lobster Linguine.  A few problems with this dish.  The linguine was a bit overcooked and the lobster turned out to be scallops.  When I asked about the lack of lobster I was politely told that there was an error on the menu. Someone couldn't have told me that when I ordered?  Wasn't I supposed to notice?  \n\nThe service was very good.  As the restaurant filled up it got hard to hear across the table. Again, the classy local restaurant atmosphere they try to project ruined.  They do have an enclosed patio area that would be much quieter but I think they like to hold those tables for private parties and large groups.  Wouldn't hurt to ask though.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a luncheon for a friend's birthday today at 11:30am and all went well. I had an appetizer the shrimp and eggplant - it was delicious.  2 waiters were great. I think I would give 5 stars if we didn't have to ask for bread and coffee. The parking garage is a bit confusing and seemed to be busy today.  We had a few empty chairs, but 11 people is a good size group.\nThank you Brio staff for a good lunch!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nLasagna Bolognese was a good dish. Meaty. Shrimp and lobster fettucine was tasty as well. Nice restaurant inside, good ambiance. I will return.  The cheesecake mascarpone was excellent!\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating an early Mothers Day, shared the Lasagna Bolognese, Salmon Griglia, Tuscan Grillled Pork Chops, Pasta Pesto and Calamari Fritto Misto. Large serving of  Lasagna and very traditional, while the Pork Chops were very tasty and prepared well. The salmon and pesto were from the \"light menu\" which were small portions. Everything was prepared and presented very well.  \nThe service was very good and the restaurant has great atmosphere for a nice evening. \nWould recommend this for a nice relaxing evening\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwhelming.  Food was just ok.  Maybe because we had a group of 10, but we were there on a Sunday and hardly anyone was there.  Food was cold and service was just ok. They hardly refilled our drinks and never offered dessert.  This used to be one of our favorites.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Brio's with my bday group of 8 girlfriends.  I, and 2 others ordered the calamari, and unfortunately we were disappointed in it. The manager came over and took replacement orders from us for the steak salads. He then credited 3 out of the 9 lunch orders to apologise for our initial disappointment.  What can I say, service like that makes me very loyal, and all my friends agreed we would continue to visit Brio's where the food is always tasty and the service is impeccable. Thank you to the manager for making my lunch special for me instead of the disaster it could have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the Scottsdale Quarter in general. The shrimp crab cakes are so good. I'm typically not one that likes the sauces that come with the food. But the sauce that comes with the shrimp crab cakes is so good. My waiter was so nice and personable I do wish I could remember his name.\n\n\n\n\n\nAte there Sat. night, party of 10, for a birthday.  LOUD, terrible service.  Waiter took 3 tries to get us right check, waited 15 minutes for coffee service and never brought the pot back for refills.  Lobster items ordered by 3 of group had no lobster in them!  Waiter ended up bringing bits of lobster to table separately.  Agree with other reviewer that food was cold by the time it finally reached the table.Veal was so over salted that it was unedible!  This was for both of the people that ordered veal.  The cod was over cooked and also unedible.  I believe there was confusion on part of wait staff as to who was handling the table.  The peach bellinis were wonderful, however.  NO WAY would I ever go back.  Sad, because it is a beautiful place with a decent menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends have raved about Brios in other parts of the country, so I finally went to the one near me. Absolutely loved the Pasta alla Vodka. Handmade pasta filled with ricotta cheese, bits of prosciutto, in the best vodka sauce ever. My friend ordered the crab cakes & also loved them. Great service, nice atmosphere, all around wonderful dining experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nI go to Brio often for happy hour. The food is always delicious but recently the service has been something to mention. A new server named Nikki took care of us and was so great that we ask for her by name when we go. You guys made a great choice when hiring her. Hope to see you all again soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid spot good for large groups. Menu and food is nothing to remember but wouldn't expect much more given it is a chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust had a great brunch with hubby Howard at Brio Tuscan Grille in Scottsdale. Had their beef carpaccio. \nLarge enough fo two with capers, special mustard and olive oil and forcaccio crackers. Fabulous and two great bloody Marys. The perfect Sunday light brunch for under $25. need I say try it!\n\n\n\n\n\nTook my daughters here for a nice lunch on a Sunday.  It was aesthetically appealing and service was fine, but the food was appallingly bad.  The chopped salad we sent back because the greens looked old.   My flatbread was cold, tasteless, and the texture of a matzoh.  The mushroom ravioli was inedible, overspiced, salty and cold.  My caprese salad was passable, but short on both olive oil & balsamic vinegar, with an anemic tomato.  For over $60, a complete bust.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite restaurants, the prices are reasonable and the food is outstanding. It's a little bit too good when you are trying to diet. However, the lobster bisque is to die for, and one of the chocolate desserts actually melts in your mouth. Definitely a great place for a nice and quality lunch or a peaceful dinner!\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me say I come to Brio especially because of their super delicious tomato bisque I can't get enough of! My only wish is that they served it more often during the week and on weekends, and not only on Tuesdays, a weekday when I rarely go because it's about 40 minutes from where I live and weekdays are always super busy. I also love their beef carpaccio, it's amazing and a must-have. It's all I ever eat (plus the soup) when we go there. Service may be slower sometimes but we keep entertained and fed with their great bread. Brio is one of my faves but please make the tomato bisque available more often!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe originality of the dishes are platitudinous however there was some fresh and delicious qualities. The bruschetta flight was decent (every place feels the need to put bruschetta on something that has the texture of a stale pretzel but its so much better on a piece of lightly toasted bread like sourdough) and the risotto had good flavor but the shrimp inside the dish were puny. Solid wine list, good happy hour, plus good service would bring me back for a snack and a drink... I would probably skip dinner though and just patron the happy hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest waiter we have had in a long time! Thank you to our server Michael. Great food and wonderful service.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here for a few family dinners. When I see family ,I'm talking 15 people at the table. For some reason Brio can't handle large groups. It's never easy.  Always chaotic. And the food honestly isn't that great.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Yelp, 3 stars says \"A-OK,\" and that's what I think of when I think back to our meal at Brio Tuscan Grille. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is expansive and the architecture is nice, in the way that many Phoenix restaurants are new and designed to look old. I didn't mind it, but it lacked the intimacy that I love from a dim Italian restaurant.\n\nOur server was nice, maybe a bit slower to get us things, but she didn't make it a bad experience. And she definitely sold us on dessert at the end - one of the most impressive parts of the meal!\n\nI got a shrimp dish that was noted on the menu to be \"healthier.\" When you're at a place like this, you know that the butter runs deep, so nothing is really healthy, but I was hoping for something a tad heartier than what I got, which was a small-ish helping of veggies and a few shrimp. Luckily, my dining companions filled my plate with tons of their food - most notably an alfredo dish that was pretty fantastic. And her portion was enormous. So...take that for what you will. Fianc got a filet, which he loved, so good on them for not messing up a good cut of meat!\n\nWine list was extensive, but not a lot of by the glass options, if I remember correctly. \n\nAgain, I really enjoyed dessert. We got the \"tasting,\" which I think was a \"small\" portion of 3 or 4 desserts, and I just remember it being massive - like we couldn't finish it all between 5 of us. There were three full size desserts. And it was only $10! Don't make me tell you twice - save room (or don't) and get this.\n\nWouldn't make this my first stop on our next trip to Phoenix, but wouldn't say no to it, either!\n\n\n\n\n\nInvited my mom there last night, found on Yelp that if you check in you have a free app.  Our server tell us that we can choose between app and bruchettas. We pick the Spicy Shrimp and eggplant and it's was delicious!!! We finished the spicy sauce with the warm bread!  We also found on Yelp some pasta with angel hair,  shrimp, caramelised onion,.. but they didn't do it anymore but the server recommend something similar and put shrimp instead of chicken  (without any up charge :) ). So we both had the Pesto pasta . It wasn't very flavoured,  we had to put some salt and pepper.. we will come back for a glass of wine and the amazing spicy shrimps and eggplant! ....and the patio is beautiful !\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my friend decided to try out brio at the quarter on Sunday very disappointed on the service we asked for one thing and the waiter brings something else after two hrs. The  food was nothing special, I will not recommend......\n\n\n\n\n\nTotally overrated and overpriced. I've been out to eat there three times now. Usually I go grab happy hour because they have a pretty good deal. So this time I went in for my birthday and had a pretty bad experience. To start off they put us (8) at a small circular table that was cramped. Next the server would disappear for 20 minute intervals and we had no idea where he went. The server was anxious and highly stressed running around and wasn't able to play close attention to such a large party. That was just the beginning. The food was sub-par. I ordered a $29 8oz filet medium rare and it was like I was chewing gum. Usually, a filet that price should be cooked the way you ask. Maybe it's the style of restaurant or chef but I received the rarest steak. I had to eat food from others at the table to be satisfied at all. My sister ordered the salmon and had to send it back because it was extremely overcooked. She has been a server for 12 years and has some kind of knowledge on food. I think for the price the food should be much higher quality. I was there for my birthday and definitely won't be going back for anything, maybe the happy hour. I hope they get this message and make some changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeh. As my fellow Yelper said to me a few days after we ate here: \"No Brio review, I'm shocked!\" \n\nI didn't jump on writing this review because I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. The ambience sucks, the service wasn't very good and the food was totally average. \n\nMy cursor is blinking at me and I still don't know what else to say about my time spent here. \n\nAmbience- looks like an Italian cheesecake factory. Why are the collumns so huge?!\n\nService- the bartender kept interrupting us to take our order when we STILL weren't ready. Jeez, does it look like I've moved my menu in the 53 seconds it's been since the last time you checked? And then disappeared when we were finally ready. \n\nFood- \n-carpaccio, not bad but does it seriously need to be that huge? The two of us didn't even come close to finishing it. \n-Mediterranean pasta, pretty much the only one without a cream sauce on the whole menu. They split it for us which was nice and it tasted all right with mushrooms and chicken and stuff. \n-tiramisu came out frozen. They were super apologetic and didn't charge us for the replacement, but it was still awkward. They obviously just heated up a piece which made it melty and just not that great.\n\nSo yeah, that's that.\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Brio location! Practically every single time we go there, we have exceptional service and tasty food (the bread is to die for!). If something's not right, they fix it right away. \n\nMy favorite dish is their beef medallions...I don't know what's in the sauce, but it's addicting! And their desserts are good too. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance to it, it's very rustic and relaxing. \n\nI highly recommend trying Brio out if you're in the mood for some good Italian food and great service!\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio is one of my favorite Italian restaurants.  You're not going to get mama's memorable home cooking from Italy, but it's good food.  Even though most dishes are very flavoable and delish, the lasagna is my favorite.  Great staff that's efficient, and professional.  Plenty of parking in garage.  You may have a wait some nights.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why this place has such a low rating. Maybe those people weren't here during happy hour? \n\nA group of five of us stopped in on Friday after work. It is an AWESOME happy hour! The Rosa Sangria is to die for, and all of the other drinks looked great, as well. The food is really what made this place special. Very reasonable prices (especially for Scottsdale) and a good amount of food. I recommend the Blackened Shrimp, the Artichoke Dip, and the Eggplant Fries (my favorite). The deserts are fabulous (there was a caramel/pumpkin cheesecake desert that was to die for, the lava cake was amazing, too!).\n\nOur waitress was very attentive, considering it was a busy time. She even held her grace when we were being difficult and asked for separate checks. The crowd is obviously very Scottsdale (Botox and plastic surgery all around), but it won't deter me.\n\nI will be returning!\n\n\n\n\n\n5 star for the best resturan that i ever gone for great pasta , kind castomer and good location . My husband and I usually go there we had a great times every time, I recommend to going there  my favorite juice is lemonade strawberry\n\n\n\n\n\nThree separate times my girlfriend and I have had issues here.\n\n1. We came on a day when the restaurant was fairly empty, maybe 5 tables in the whole place. Food took forever, waitress would disappear for a long time.  Everyone has an off day but this did leave a sour taste.\n\n2. My girlfriend wanted to have her birthday party so we wanted to go visit the restaurant and while there set up the party. We arrived and the wait was 45+ minutes.  No biggie but we didn't have time to wait.  She asked if the manager was available to discuss a party of 20+.  The hostess was extremely rude. Had she said, \"I am sorry, the manager is busy right now so may I take your information?\" then that would have been fine.  But she was like \"The manger will not see you right now. We are in the middle of dinner rush.\" in a very rude voice.  We called later and the manager said he would have been happy to see us and that she was indeed being rude.  He did not try to salvage the party reservation.\n\n3. Last night we went again. It started off great with the waiter seeing to our needs. We got our appetizer and soup and then he disappeared for a long time. When he returned he informed us that he had forgotten to put in our dinner order.  He took off one soup, which was nice of him, but in this situation the manager should have visited the table.  We were there for a long time and left with a bad taste in our mouth.\n\nWe love the lobster bisque but will not return.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the decor in this restaurant- it makes it seem very upscale and authentic to European cuisine. However, the prices are too steep and portions are too small (compared with the nearby Maggiano's). The service is nice and the complimentary bread has some variety, which makes it quite interesting. Here are some dishes we've tried:\n- Pasta Brio: the most unique of the bunch & quite tasty\n- Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine: rich sauce, would've liked more seafood though\n- Campanelle Carbonara: slightly disappointing and very run-of-the-mill flavor\n\n\n\n\n\nVery good.  When you check in you get a free appetizer! Every yelper can get excited over that. I chose the spinach artichoke dip and it was good, on the heavier richer side but yummy! Than I ordered the sliced steak salad which was delicious but drenched in dressing. We finished up with the lava cake which was AMAZING! So decadent. They had chocolate ice cream on it instead of vanilla and I loved it! The bite of cold ice cream warm cake  and hot filing was just SO good. I'm talking drive her again just to have the lava cake good.  Worth the splurge on calories\n\n\n\n\n\nI have sent the restaurant a private message as well, shall see if we hear back.  Went for dinner here with a party of 9 a few weeks ago. The place was packed, while we were seated quite promptly for our reservation, everything from that point on was far from prompt or good. Sat down at 7, finally were able to place our food order at about 7:40, by 8:30 still didn't have our food. Everyones luke warm food finally came, except for my husbands, he waited another 7-8 minutes for his, lucky him, he had the only hot dish. It was like everyone else' meal sat under the heat lamp, like a gooey mess of pasta and we even had a rare lamb chop in the mix :-( Manager came over to apologize and say that he was sorry and would take care of us. Had a few creme brulee's comped and the lamb chops. Will not be dining back here again, manager just seemed to be putting out fires and we were one of them. Our waitress tried her best and was apologetic. Very unimpressive, pricey meal for what we got.\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic service from Sarah at the bar! She is so funny & friendly. All our food was delicious! Definitely coming back here again soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friends and I have been coming almost every Wednesdays for months. We come during happy hour and sit on the patio. Usually, the host is very helpful and we are sat right away. The happy hour prices are very nice, their Tomato Mozzarella salad is awesome! That's what I get all the time.\nHowever, we do not come here for the service, that's for sure, to be honest, it is quite horrible. Which is the reason why I only put 4 stars.\nI came here for dinner a few times as well, their pasta are delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst service ever!\nWe went on Mother's Day just me my husband and son, hostess was rude and said they were booked for the night but we could sit in the bar. I had to ask twice about the booths before she stopped texting to answer me. \nWe sat in the bar forever before we were greeted. We sometimes saw our waiter even when we stood up to flag him down he avoided us but was in the back where we could still see him talking, dancing and standing around. Even when we tried to flag down the manager he walked right by us twice. My husband's salad never came but we were still charged for it, our pasta was cold and just beyond disappointed in the place we picked for my first Mother's Day. Will never go back or recommend to another person.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a reservation for 13 people. After we sat down, there was a 20 minute wait for our two waiters to just take our drink order. After we FINALLY got our drinks, they took our food order. Halfway through the order, a different server took over. Then, we waited an hour for our food. Two people in our party ordered the lasagna. As they were delivering the food, they informed us that they only had one serving so they split it in half and served it. We had two children under the age of 5 with us and we asked for dough for them to play with four times before they brought it over. Also, had to ask for drinks several times before they were brought to the table. The manager never came over and talked to us. From where we were sitting we could see that he was looking at us and talking about our table. When the brought the bill, there were still the 2 separate orders of lasagna on it, even though they took one full order and split it in half for two people. I was highly disappointed in the service. Not once did they apologize or ask if there was anything they could do. I will never return back to this restaurant or recommend it to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love going to this place. I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. Their customer service on the other hand is a hit and miss :(\n\nHowever, their food speaks for itself so it hasn't dampened my opinion of this place. \n\nI love their steak salad. It's very, very tasty. Just order the dressing on the side though. It's over powering if you let them mix it in, at least in my humble opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I say, the ambiance when you walk in looks like a nicer, more upper class version of Cheesecake factory. It has high ceilings, drapes, expo kitchen... everything you'd want in an Italian-american spot.\n\nThe wait staff seemed kind but a bit \"above the rest\"... if you know what I mean. Just because the location is in Scottsdale doesn't mean you need to act out the assumed local attitude.\n\nIn the food department, the food looked beautiful. Plated for a photo opp, so that was nicely done. As for flavor, it doesn't stand out to me as a place that is AMAZING... it is more of a 'good' place to eat. I would definitely not drive out of my way for this restaurant. But if I'm again in the area and craving this type of cuisine, I'll most likely stop in\n\n\n\n\n\nI went last night with a group of friends,  I had a Brio Steak Salad, and it was very good. The waiter was very nice and friendly. I also have a cosmopolitan martini that I LOVE it!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot impressed with restuarant but they're Happy Hour is amazing - that's impressive! You have to get there early though or you will find not one seat - $2-3 dollars a plate for very good Italian, no wonder it's not easy...Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the lasagna there and it was good. Large portions came out on the plates. They had only 3 drafts on tap so not much choice there.  I would come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was here a couple of days ago for lunch with a client.  Instead of fighting for parking at Kierland, why not check this place out the next time you're in the area?\n\nIt's an attractive restaurant with a big open dining area.  Kinda fun to people watch.\n\nI had the mezza chicken.  Basically a chicken breast, mashed potatoes, grilled veggies with a mushroom sauce over the top.  Plenty of food, that's for sure.\n\nGood service and reasonable prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food paired with the worst service I've ever had. Received our entree before our drink. Had to walk to the bar to get my water filled. Never again\n\n\n\n\n\nI was last at Brio Tuscan Grille in this location in early February and gave it a 4 star review.  I went back today with an old friend who has also greatly enjoyed this restaurant many times in the past.  We were both very disappointed.\n\nI had the Shrimp Mediterranean just as I did, just one month ago, in February.  This time, instead of ample perfectly cooked stalks of asparagus, there were two or three small cuts off one spear.  Instead of an abundance of  fresh vegetables cooked to perfection, they were sparse, limp and not very fresh tasting.  The orzo was unimpressively prepared.The shrimp was still  good.\n\nMy friend had the special which said it had scallops and eggplant among other listed ingredients....I think it included rissoto.  While the scallops were perfectly prepared, the rest of the meal lacked any significant amount of egg plant and other listed ingredients.  She said it tasted like all tomato.  The eggplant was her main attraction to this menu item and was grossly underrepresented.\n\nThis is the only time we have ever had a coupon, but I do not think the sharp drop in quality was because of that.  There was some confusion in applying the coupon that required some kind of a card or a phone number despite having printed and presented the coupon received in my e-mail.\n\nThe bread and lavosh were still excellent, as always, but the dessert selection was not as imaginative as usual and did not tempt us enough to order.\n\nI hope this was an anomaly, rather than the new normal.  We have enjoyed this restaurant in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place! The food is absolutely delicious and the service is always spectacular. I recommend ordering their casear salad- their homemade dressing is impeccable. Also their flatbread and pasta alla vodka are both favorite dishes of mine\nLove this place, always stop by when i'm in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of us tried Brio on a Thursday night at 6 PM.  It wasn't crowded, except in the bar where the happy hour crowd was enjoying themselves.  The rest of the place was only about 70% full so we got a table immediately, and it was pleasant and not noisy.\n\nMy wife ordered the Bistecca side salad for $3.95 which she said had a great dressing.  She enjoyed it.  The sour dough bread and flat bread was good too.  Our main courses were Angel Hair Pasta Primavera for $14.50, and I had the Daily Fish Special, $18.95, which was three large Sea Scallops with a salad of greens and mixed fresh veggies with  a balsamic vinegar dressing.  I loved the Scallops and salad.  My wife liked her pasta dish too.\n\nThe desert selections offered were small bowls with different fillings.  We enjoyed the Key Lime pie filling, for $2.45.  \n\nOur server was nice, efficient, with just the right amount of attention to our needs without being a bother.\n\nThe parking is in a multi-level parking garage that is right next to Brio.  It wasn't a hassle to park, but it wasn't very crowded so we parked on the first level.  There is valet parking for $6.\n\nOverall we really enjoyed ourselves.  And we think most people would like Brio.  Our total bill was $56.73, before tip.  This included one glass of wine at $7.95, and one beer for $4.75.\n\n\n\n\n\nHands-down, Brio is one of my favorite places in all of Scottsdale and across the country as a whole.  I know that, no matter what city I'm in while on travel, I'll get good food and good wine from Brio and the staff is pretty darn professional.  I love Brio happy hour, especially the ravioli and beef carapacio and the Brio burger is BY FAR one of the best for a chain restaurant. \n\nI first started going to Brio a number of years ago back east in the DC area, and I've been a fan ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were looking on Yelp for a good seafood restaurant near the Phoenix Mayo Clinic tonight and found Brio Tuscan Cafe had good reviews. Not only that, but Yelp offered a free appetizer. We were so glad we tried it! Our appetizer, Roasted Garlic, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, was yummy, and our entrees were uniquely prepared, presented, and delicious. I had the Grilled Salmon Fresco, and my husband had Shrimp Verduta. Can't wait to return and try some of their other wonderful options!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a disaster. Went in for lunch on a Sunday and it was dead. Our waitress was fine but the food made the Olive Garden look like a Michelin star restaurant. I sent back my salad because it was wilted and slimy. The minestrone was super salty and tasted like it came out of a can. My sister's ravioli wasn't good... It tasted like it was heated up in a microwave. My mom got a caprese salad and it was okay but nothing to write home about. The flatbread was cold with very anemic looking tomatoes  and tasted like it had canned Parmesan cheese on it. For $60 with tip, even with the salad taken off, it was like highway robbery. Absolutely the worst italian food I've ever had.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, I've tried 3 out of the 118 Brio Tuscan Grille's.\n\nI've tried their location in Alexandria, Virginia, which I previously reviewed (3/5 Stars), a couple visits to their location in Gilbert, Arizona (4/5 Stars), and was close to this location, and thought I'd try it.\n\nBRAVO BRIO RESTAURANT GROUP\n\nBravo Brio Restaurant Group is the parent company of the Bravo! Cucina Italiana, Bon Vie Bistro, Brio Tuscan Grille, \"Brio Coastal Bar & Kitchen\", restaurant chains in the United States. \n\nThe company owns 118 restaurants and trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol BBRG. \n\nIt was established in 1992 by Rick and Chris Doody in collaboration with Executive Chef Phil Yandolino, and is based in Columbus, Ohio.

The two bartenders Marian and Brenden were the perfect hosts!! They were friendly and beyond helpful in deciding on what to eat! Thank you so much for taking such good care of us. We are most definitely coming back to Brio of Scottsdale!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent this evening for the first time actually as a fluke. Was waiting for a table at Postinos, but they had a wait there thay was a hour long. My friend and I were roaming around and stumbled upon Brio. We went in to just get a drink at the bar, but was greeted with such friendly service that we decided to just stay for dinner. Wednesday was $5.00 martini day in the bar area. Had 2 different ones that were great. A lemon drop and a peach one. The yummy basket of bread was a nice treat until our salads came. Great wedge salad. Got the vodka sauce pasta with ricotta, and it was so tasty. Cooked to perfection. What a nice restaurant to just stumble upon, but will be back again soon. yummo\n\n\n\n\n\nWent last nite for happy hour.    Weds is also $5 martini nite evidently!   I had the Raspberitini and the Lemon/Basil tini.    Both were excellent!  Our server Brie was happy to bring us samples of the HH wines ...... but my friend didn't care much for them and opted for a $9 glass of blended red from Australia..... at the recommendation of another server.  \nWe ordered 4 appetizers of the HH menu ...caprese salad .... very good.     Margarita Flatbread ..... excellent.   Beef Carpaccio ..... tasty and beautifully presented.    And the black peppered shrimp  .... we asked for the spicy sauce on the side, which we got.   And we asked to hold the black pepper, and just bring the peppermill ..... as I don't like black pepper or spicy!\nHere's where they failed!   The batter/breading mix already has the pepper mixed in!   And it's on both the eggplant base AND the shrimp!!   If only the kitchen had informed Brie of that!\nWell she did her best and offered to order something different for us and had it taken of the check.   We ordered the garlic/artichoke/cheese dip instead and it was great.\nI believe Brie has only been there a couple of weeks.... she did a wonderful job!\n\n\n\n\n\nI used to eat lunch here weekly when I worked next door. That was almost 5 years ago. After I moved back to Phoenix, I thought that I lived and worked so far away from Brio. Tonight I made the trip and will be back on a regular basis as it is worthy he drive. The food is still fantastic. Our server John in the lounge dining area was one of the best I have had the pleasure of dealing with in a long time. Totally professional and very friendly. Larry the bartender actually remembered me from when I used to lunch there. I was amazed. Everyone I came into contact with tonight was great. The wedge salad and lobster bisque were excellently presented and very affordable. The martini and craft beer we enjoyed were perfectly prepared. I would recommend this place to anyone who is dining at Scottsdale Quarter. It is a great value proposition in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot bad.  Service was good and food moderately priced.  More of an open concept, so it is loud depending on the night.  I order the crusted filet and it was great.  I'd go there again.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to a Sunday lunch with my mom, but never again.  The service was awful and it wasn't even busy at all.  My mom ordered a chicken flatbread only to find two hairs (not hers) and a piece of plastic wrapper? No thank you...\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the presentation of the dishes,  the quality and freshness! The happy hour it's amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was bland and barely edible.  The beef app was a joke.  It had no flavor.  Even the mustard didn't help.   The caesar salad was yellow.  Not even a shade of green in there at all.  The lobster bisque lacked flavor.\n\n\n\n\n\nI give two stars strictly because the customer service was TERRIBLE, I guess we came late and agitated our server, but who knows. The food was very good I had a flatbread that was excellent and the carpaccio was also good and HUGE. The mall that Brio is located in could really use a jolt of electricity, but that seems to be all too familiar these days with the funky economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here for a Bon Voyage dinner for our good friend leaving for Australia.  Our reservations were through Open Table.  We were promptly seated.  Our server, Christa was excellent.  She worked with my wife to secretly plan to put a decoration my wife had made on our friend's dessert.  The appetizer, eggplant with grilled shrimp was delectable.  Sourdough bread and crispy flatbreads were fresh and fully flavored.  The Pesto Pasta with chicken as well as the Tomato Bisque soup was memorable.  Finally the desserts...unforgettable.  The Carmel marsclpon cheesecake withe the Australian  Flag on top, and the Tiramisu.  The restaurant was clean including the restrooms.  Valet parking $6.00.  All in all a great experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many things that come to my mind when I think of Brio.  Interesting food, great quality, elegant atmosphere and friendly service.  But one thing has stood out recently since I have gone there and that is, $2.95 appetizers in the bar until 6pm.  When you think something is $2.95, you probably think it is either a small portion, not good or both of these things.  Well it is neither of these things.  The appetizers are generous portions and great tasting with several selections to choose from.  I want to just make it easy and say to the waiter, I'll have one of each please.  I love a good cheeseburger and the Brio Bistecca Burger is definitely my favorite right now.  It comes on a tasty bun with mozzarella cheese and is served with well done potato chips...yum!  You don't even get messy eating it because they cut it into quarters for you.  The bruschetta is also easy to eat because you can just pick it up and bite it.  They have two different kinds on the happy hour menu.  Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta with fresh basil and a balsamic drizzle and Sliced Steak Brushetta with Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and Tuscan Italian dressing.  There is also a Margherita Flatbread that is prepared with Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil cooked in an authentic Italian wood-burning oven.  I don't eat calamari but my friends ordered the Calamari Fritto Misto which was fried to a crisp golden brown with peperoncini and they liked it.  This is probably just either half or less than half of what they offer for $2.95.  I still haven't tried either shrimp appetizers or the eggplant appetizer.  The Beef Carpaccio served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and fresh Parmesan cheese looks excellent as well.  Tuscan culinary creations are perfected at Brio.  If you decide to go, please save me a seat in the bar.  As you can imagine, they go rather quickly.  Buon Appetito!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe hadn't been back to Brio for almost a year so were worried that it might not have the same pizazz it had before. However, we had an excellent lunch (my wife had a flatbread and I crab cakes with some delicious veggies). The only disappointment was the free tiramisu birthday dessert that wasn't much more than heavy whipped cream with a touch of coffee taste. Service was not particularly attentive.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was not disappointed .......... the service and food were Very Good.\n\n                  You'll find a  Quality Meal ....... with Quality Prices.\n                  From the Hostess to the Servers ........ its all Ten's. \n\nAbout the Food ...... Throughout my life ..... I've had better Italian.\nThis is Upscale Dinning ....... its more about the experience ...... then the Food.\nConversations with your tablemates ....... are almost impossible ..... Extremely Noisy. \n\n        By all means ........ Try it Once ........ Then decide for yourself about return visits. \n\n                       Me ......... I'll be back ....... every 2 or 3 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days after the amazing Yelp event at Brio, I decided to go back to enjoy my FREE bruschetta! This visit was yet again, AMAZING! First off, Kimberly, our waitress, was the most personable, helpful, awesome waitress ever! She was very insightful and suggested some pretty tasty appetizers. I'm not a fan of eggplant, but she assured me it was to-die-for. She was not lying, it was delicious!\n\nThey also had the same live music as the Yelp event had and he was just the perfect sound for a happy hour date on the patio.\n\nThen, to top it off, the manager that was hosting the Yelp event came over and introduced himself. Thanked me for going to the Yelp event and for coming back! So hospitable! I felt like I had a second royal treatment!\n\nThanks Brio, you guys are awesome!! :)\n\n\n\n\n\nWooo, very great food and great service. Thank you Mary! I applied a coupon on yelp, then I ordered a tomato mozzarella(appetizer) dish which is good for diet( low calorie). And it was very delicious! After lunch, I was told the lunch was $0 balance! A surprise!   I will definitely come back with my friends and highly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful decor, super friendly staff, but it's a chain...\n\nTypical italian fare and a brunch menu, so we tried both.  We had the french toast which is better at IHOP or any other breakfast joint.  We also tried the lunch sandwich and salad combo. My turkey club panini was a waste...tons of bread with one slice of turkey, too much cheese, and an unchewable tomato.  The chopped salad was ordinary.\n\nWe won't be going back. Once is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were very disappointed by this restaurant. We expected to be impressed, and simply were not. This place does not live up to its hype. \n\nWe came here for a birthday dinner, and I had a certificate for a free Beef Medallions with Shrimp Scampi. We also ordered the Brio Chopped salad and Calamari. \n\nThe salad was delicious, but we weren't impressed by much else. The calamari was tasteless to say the least. The beef medallions were not cooked to our preference- we ordered them medium rare and they came out well done. The shrimp scampi included only a few shrimp on top of the medallions, all sitting on a bed of orzo pasta and small pieces of roasted vegetables tossed in a sauce. \n\nWe were just disappointed. I would suggest going somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to go there for lunch as my wife had a work outing there and enjoyed the food.  The restaurant was less than a quarter full and the waitress was friendly.  The food was decent (calimari, lobster bisque and salads) and the portion sizes were fine.  I was just puzzled why it would take over 30 minutes to receive our salad orders and soup.  Since the restaurant was empty I did not expect to wait that long for a rather simple order.  We then had to wait over 15 minutes to pay.  My final impression of my experience was having 3 hostesses (or waitresses) hanging out by the front door gossiping and ignoring me.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely fabulous experience today for lunch.  This is a great place to eat if you have food allergies or sensitivities. Not only do they offer several options that are gluten free, but they were also quite flexible about making some variations for my friend who has many food limitations. The manager Steve was very personable and came to our table to be sure my friend's needs were well taken care of.  My Pesto Chicken & Quinoa Salad was excellent as well. To top it off, it is conveniently located near the parking structure and the prices are reasonable. I will be back again soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nLovely interior but average to below avg. food and definitely over-priced for the quality of the dishes.\nThis was my second time at Brio - first time was lunch and food was fine (Strawberry/Chicken salad) but service (for 2) was terrible! It took 40 min. & 2 inquiries after ordering to receive the salads. At the time I thought, while the salads were good (not great or unique) it wasn't worth the wait or the high prices, though the restaurant itself is lovely. Also, I had to ask for a table that wasn't next to the loud clanging of the open kitchen so my friend & I could talk without shouting.\nSo, 8 mos. later my 17 yr. old wants to celebrate his birthday where? Yup - table for 5, dinner, please!\nI will say the server was very nice & very accommodating. However, once again we found ourselves seated right next to the open kitchen & we were told all the tables for 5 were by the kitchen - so we shouted over the din (restaurant was only 1/2 full?). So, with entrees from $18.95 - 23.95 we opted for the \"Dinner Special\" an all-inclusive 3 course meal (3 entrees to choose from) for $16.95 ea., (beverage extra) and the ravioli appetizer. \nThe appetizer was delicious - only 4 large ravioli for $14.95 though and the Chicken Milanese ordered by 3 of our 5 was enjoyed. I tasted it and it was good. My choice, the penne diavolo w/chicken tasted like spicy cheesy-Mac with tomato sauce mixed in - not great at all. Our other guest had the strawberry-chicken salad and enjoyed that.\nHowever, it was agreed that basically it's Olive Garden at twice the price in a better neighborhood. If you want authentic, true delicioso Italian food I recommend Roma Garden - same prices, not a pretty neighborhood but mamma mia, it's authentic! Or any other favorite place you love for Italian - Brio is not for foodies or anyone who wants to talk at a meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent into Brio the other night as SQ is close to home.  The restaurant was very nice looking and being as it was happy hour I took a seat at the bar.  The bar staff was very friendly and I was happy to find out they had some awesome deals for happy hour.  I tried their shrimp and eggplant appetizer and it was amazing.  I'm not usually a big veggie guy but between the shrimp and sauce this dish is delicious.  The bread was warm and fresh and I ended up using too much of it to sop up the sauce from the appetizer dish and made myself full.  Can't wait to come back and try more.\n\n\n\n\n\nI work at Scottsdale Quarter and this little gem never disappoints! I always receive Outstanding Service! I'm constantly stopping in for my quick lunches which they accommodate by being quick with my order! Also, several peers I work with enjoy meeting up for drinks or a snack on the patio!!\n\n\n\n\n\nthe food was exceptional and the waiter was awesome...everything was timed perfectly...my wife said her chicken was one of the best dishes shes ever had...i had the lobster and shrimp linguini...excellent...the strawberry shortcake was fresh and very tasty...definitely would go again\n\n\n\n\n\nCheesecake Factory is way better. This place has very slow service and the hostesses seemed stuck up. The food wasn't all that great either, but the appetizers are pretty tasty. I think this place is way overrated.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food in a fun, upscale atmosphere, but you can come here dressed in anything.   Restaurant can be loud, but you can still talk, so that is good.  The food was excellent, although the service was slow for our table of 6.  The restaurant was busy, but our server seemed overloaded.  All the food we ordered was great, though and everything we saw that went by looked yummy.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Brio! We come here all the time and are never disappointed. The happy hour is amazing, great options for food and drinks. The other night we had the brushetta Quattro, an all time favorite, minestrone soup, Caesar salad and tomato caprese. The bartenders are great, Larry and Brendan always take care of us. Chef Mike and the manager Kayla stopped by to see how everything was, definitely appreciated. Rarely does the manager AND chef stop by the table at other restaurants! The customer service is on point here and the food always exceeds expectations. I will be a Brio fan for life!\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy hour is a killer time here at Brio.  Not only do they have happy hour, but they have reverse happy hour!  I came in for 50% Ravioli, and I found out about some awesome Happy Hour prices of grand total of $3 per appetizer.  1 or 2 appetizers, you are good to go.  I highly recommend the Lobster Ravioli.  It had a spicy flavor with the right amount of sauce and cream.  The lobster inside felt like I was in heaven!\n\nMy only complaint of the night that does not give this great place a 5 star is that service was quite slow.  It could have been because of the many patrons during happy hour, but there was not as much detail and attention.\n\nIf you are looking for authentic tasting food as though you were in Tuscany, Brio is the place to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have eaten hear previously and the food was good except for the last two times. \n\nWe had reservations for dinner as it was Mother's Day. Our waiter was great . Appetizers were good we had brochette sampler . We ordered two orders of the fettuccine with shrimp and lobster and shrimp and lobster risotto. Also the six ounce filet. \nThe Pasta in one of the entree's had been left sitting and was cold and rubbery looking ,as the person eating it is a manager in a restaurant she was not happy.The lobster in all three pasta dishes was mushy . Therefore none of us ate the pasta. Mothers day dinner was bread and appetizers. The steak was also burnt. \nThe manager took all off the pasta dishes and apologized but that did not make up for not having  dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe got in here without a 50 minute wait that was the option at True Food, which is our go-to place in the Q.\nThe service was excellent and the waitress got me a nice cushioned chair from inside that made me comfortable.\nThe starter was very good, Bruschetta Quattro, or something like that. But I had the Mediterranean Pasta which was just blah! My wife had Salmon salad which was OK but nothing special. I was tasting my dish and just thought that nothing stood out at all. I do not use dressing or flavoring so it was just not tasty food.\nI guess we will stick to True Food, it has a long wait for a reason.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding service by Chase. Truly exception for our group of six adults and 2 tired kids. \n\nThe atmosphere is comfortable and food was tasty, as always at Brio. We had the Gorgonzola beef medallions, 5oz filet, pasta far diabolical with chicken and chicken Milanese. Several substitutions (fries for mashed, etc) and no problems at all. \n\nService was quick and friendly. Food was hot. Overall a great experience for a family on vacation. It was my sister in law's birthday and it was the perfect place for a nice evening. The free app with Yelp check in is also a nice perk. \n\nWith the free app, Chase made several recommendations and adjusted it to our needs. We ended up with the bruschetta sampler with 4 steak and 4 roasted red pepper. Omitting the ones with bacon. \n\nI highly recommend this location.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Risotto duo was GREAT...one was lobster one was scallops....beautiful presentation and both were delicious\n\n\n\n\n\nMy review is for the Happy Hour. This place is packed for happy hour basically every day. Recently, my wife and I were lucky enough to score a table on the patio. The restaurant, bar and patio are beautiful. The patio has plenty of umbrellas to keep the sun out of the eyes while you sip on some cold beverages. The service was courteous and prompt. I actually felt like a guest.\n\nThey have raised the prices on the happy hour bites from $3 to $4. We ordered a Brio Burger with cheese which was cut into fourths and it was huge. Not a bad tasting burger. The Picante Shrimp was excellent as well. The sausage and pepperoni flat bread was just ok for me. But last time, we only spent about 12 bucks for food plus whatever the drinks cost. And of course taxes and tip.\n\nThis is a great chill place with a lot of ambiance to hang out with friends for Happy Hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here on the 4th of July for dinner..  There were not many patrons which was great!   We sat right down and had Ashley as our server.  She was excellent. We had the burrata & ciabatta ap w/ a side of balsamic (free w/ Yelp checkin), double pork chop (beyond tender and moist), Milanese (great size), and the pasta pesto.  All of our food was very good, made exactly how we ordered w/ a few changes. I would definitely come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nCody was our waiter and we had amazing table side service. The meals were perfectly cooked and the bread was warm. We only wished we had room for dessert. Highly recommended as always. The \"go to\" for a great family dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio Tuscan Grille is one of my favorite restaurants. So much so that I drive from Tucson to Scottsdale to go there. Their service is great, setting is fancy and food is perfect. They serve a loaf of bread and chips before the meal. I'm an east coaster who values good seafood and they have one of the best Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine I've had in Arizona. Their Lobster Bisque is also a favorite. Paired with their new zesty Watermelon Margarita. For dessert I order the chocolate cake that has fudge in the middle.\n\n\n\n\n\nTasty brunch / lunch of shrimp & grits with a perfectly poached egg. Our waiter Kelvin was very nice. He did great at keeping drinks full & was present as often as possible without being obnoxious. Overall great visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio has catered a few events that I have gone to in the last few years. Always fantastic food. But, I had never been in the restaurant itself before.\nI came here with my  daughter for lunch. I was not hungry till the next morning.\nThere is lots of covered parking in the garage. Which is really nice for starters.\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful inside. You can eat on the patio or inside .\nThe hostess greeted us immediately  and gave us a wonderful booth.\nI was drinking hot tea, but my daughter had a few cocktails. A Bellini which was frozen (a little different) but,she said it was good. Also a Basil gimlet, which she said was OK.\nThe food was really the best! I got Lobster Bisque soup which that alone was a full meal. Then I got crab cakes they came with vegetables. Wow, very tasty and more than I could eat. My daughter got a salad, and Pasta Pompadour with Eggplant.\nAgain way too much and she took most  of it to go.\nFood was fantastic, service was very good.\nToo bad it is so far away from me. But, I never mind driving. It is a win win day or night out here. Plus they play fabulous Italian music!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery delicious food and the pricing is great too. We order their family bundles for delivery and there is always leftovers. It's really a great value considering the amount of food you get. The salads that come with are always fresh and never soggy. I also use the leftover bread that wasn't eaten at dinner and make French toast in the oven with it. Awesome service too.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was excellent!  Decor was fabulous! Would have given 5 stars but was a little bit noisy.  Will absolutely be going back.  Soon I hope!\n\n\n\n\n\nWell it was off to Brio last night for \"date\" night!!!  \n\nThe last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years we've been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever!\nThe food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history I'll admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you we'd been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking we'd be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a 'trumpet' shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said \"Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles\".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!  \nThen it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, we'd not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didn't, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now you're probably saying, 'why didn't you do something about it'?  We'd have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished he's known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if he'd been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess' he'd have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES.....\n\n\n\n\n\nI am one who actually believes that spending money on pasta is stupid. But this is amazing! The best pasta ever! Had the Pasta Alla Vodka, so delicious! Will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad lunch at BRIO today. Food was good as always. Unfortunately it was freezing inside the restaurant. We noticed that three large double doors were open to the outside patio where two guests were having lunch under two large space heaters. We asked our waitress, then the hostess and then the manager if they could close some or all the doors. We were advised that the fire code REQUIRED that all three doors remain open if there were any guests on the patio. Seemed strange. After more guests inside complained about the temperature (61 degrees) in the restaurant they closed one of the doors. Still freezing. Seems that the manager lied to us about the fire code or he broke it when he shut one of the doors. Does anyone know?\n\nBy the way as we left we noticed another restaurant next door where people were eating outside on their patio under heaters and none of their doors were open.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here with my dad.  I got a side salad to start which was delicious.  And I got the Chicken Limone as my entree.  It was so delicious!  My dad got the Fish Limone Pasta dish.  It was ok.  I think it would have been better if the fish was grilled or baked.  It was fried fish which made the already heavy dish even more heavier.  The only thing I didn't care for was my drink.  I got the tropical cosmo that was on happy hour.  The happy hour prices are unbelievable.  This was my first time here and I will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio Tuscan Grille is a chain of formula restaurants serving Northern Italian  inspired food, much like Maggianno's Little Italy  is a chain that serves more Southern Italian inspired food.\n\nIt has about 30 locations and is HQ in Ohio. There is another one in Gilbert, AZ.\n\nThe decor is sumptious and large, with high ceilings, dark woods, draped white cotton materials in archways and to the center of the dining room, with Tuscan marble color inspired motif in beiges and terra cota, and faux terra cota wall textures in golden orange hues.. \n\nThe bar is a classic marble top with dark wood storage canopy overhead, and several booths where there is no wait. The dining room is very large, almost ballroom size. There is also a large patio for snowbirds to enjoy the Scottsdale winter weather. \n\nI-Pop plays incessently on the speakers. (I-Pop is Italian top 40s music, not the latest music player from Apple!)\n\nThe food is Tuscan inspired but has an American slant to many dishes and ingredients. And like Maggiano's, the dishes are HUGE!\n\nI sat at the bar for lunch and ordered from the Primi portion of the menu (meaning first, or appetizers) a Beef Carpaccio ($9.95) and Spicy Pepper Shrimp on Grilled Eggplant ($9.95).  \n\nThey were served in long narrow oval dishes. The Carpaccio was in a plate about 18 inches long! Nice raw beef, covered with olive oil, capers, and a streak of Aioli. In the center was a stack of arugula in a nice, sweet, but light dressing, and served with 2 triangles of brittle cheese infused bread crackers.\n\nThe Shrimp came in a rich cream sauce, with each shrimp laying atop a breaded and grilled Melanzone, or eggplant wedge, with a healthy dose of black pepper throughout to spice it up. The flavors were great, but a little overdone in richness and peppers, and too oily in the eggplant. \n\nThey serve fresh warm bread and herb seasoned cracker wedges with butter, complimentary. Iced tea was $2.50.\n\nService was very friendly, and professional. All staff wear white shirts and Ties, like you would find in most restaurants in Firenze, Italia..\n\nThis is a great place to bring family and friends in the beautiful new Scottsdale Quarter mall, which is still under construction and right across from the higher end Kierland Commons on North Scottsdale Road.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was my first and last time at Brio. The service was disappointing and the waiter was not personable or attentive at all until he presented us with the bill. \nWhen I made the reservations, I notated it was my daughters 25th birthday. Obviously, no one read it so why bother putting down extra instructions?  No one said Happy birthday or offered a house dessert to celebrate the occasion. \nIt took 15-20 minutes before we received water or bread on the table.\nDrew, the waiter basically ignored us and spent a majority of his time telling the patrons in the booth next to us his life story. \nThey ran out of fettuccine noodles and substituted spaghetti in the pasta dish we ordered at the same price. How does an Italian Resturant run out of pasta?\nI choose to spend my money at the Mission in Scottsdale where the food is great and server Simone is superb!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAte at Brio last night for dinner and was very pleased with the meal.  We sat in the bar area and the atmosphere was comfortable, absolutely nothing to complain about the service, and the food was delicious.  I had the Lasagna which was served with a mixture of alfredo and red sauce.  It was seriously one of the best lasagna dishes I have had in a long time.  Loved the bread plate before the meal.  One thing that stood out on the service: I dropped a knife while eating, and by the time I was able to pick it up, a waiter was already at the table with a new knife and took the one I dropped.  It's the little things that make tipping feel like it was worth it!  The only thing keeping it from getting a higher rating is it did feel like a corporate restaurant.  In this case, that's probably not a bad thing because I would imagine the food and service remains very consistent.  Brio is definitely above average in both categories.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have eaten at this wonderful and beautiful restaurant many times. Every time has been great! The service was fast, helpful and friendly. The atmosphere is comfortable and upscale. The food is well portioned, plated perfectly and tastes delectable. There is many selections and will have something for any ones taste buds. I would strongly recommend the bruchetta combination for an appetizer.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumption of Italian food is one of my favorite pastimes, and I've found Brio to be a pretty good spot to do that.  It's location within Scottsdale Quarter, which does not have the best parking situation, is really the only negative here.\n\nI'm usually coming here for dinner, and most recently we treated ourselves to a bruschetta sampler plate as an appetizer.  It came with three different variations, three pieces each, and all were spectacular.  I especially like the mozzarella and red pepper.  The bread was crunchy and the mozzarella was pure deliciousness!\n\nFor my entree I went with the Lasagna Bolognese.  Portion size was great.  I find a lot of places usually skimp on the meat with these dishes, but this one had a lot, which was fantastic.  There was a little too much cream based sauce topped over it for me, but that is a relatively minor complaint.\n\nAll in all I've enjoyed every meal I've had here, and I'm sure I'll be back for more!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a wonderful night we had at the Yelp event!  Fantastic food, bruschettas, homemade cocktails and delicious pastas and desserts.  We enjoyed ourselves to no end chatting with our friends and taking in the ambiance of such a unique place.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here for my brother's birthday last night. It was my first time and I heard good reviews so I was excited. The sourdough bread and crackers they brought out first were delicious. There's a Yelp check in offer for a free appetizer with purchase, so I ordered the roasted garlic artichoke and spinach dip. So yummy! It comes with a Parmesan flatbread. For my entree I got a Caesar salad and the Fettuccine Campania (fettuccine with spicy marinara, capers, kalamata olives, basil and parmesan). Really good! I normally don't like pasta but this was an exception. I didn't like the salad, too much dressing and cheese. My brother got a mini dessert, key lime pie. Yum. It was great overall. I loved the nice decor and the bathrooms are swanky and smelled good. They have a private dining area and a type of sunroom with a fireplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat calamari & lava cake!  Mediocre service, entrees were served cool-warm.  Think our server couldn't handle all of clientele.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally Brio is great, you know what your getting but the time I went to this location it was sloppy. Everything was thrown together as if the staff was anxiously waiting to get off and had checked out for the day.\n\nThe food was fine but no one was paying attention. We waited forever for a refill on the water, our burger came out at the wrong temp, we asked for sauce and small things on the side and they never came. Dissapointing Brio, step up your game !\n\n\n\n\n\nTonight was an utter failure. A Monday night - not a busy time for them.\n\nI've held off on updating my review for several sub-par visits. But, tonight was the tipping point.\n\nSo, here's the deal:\nNewer server: 3 stars - clearly a bit overwhelmed; took several minutes to greet us; was very polite; took the orders accurately; very slow to fulfill drink orders; one glass came with a huge lipstick stain on it; didn't put the entree orders in to the kitchen until after the appetizer was consumed; was slow to check back but was very visibly trying to handle his workload with other tables.\n\nKitchen staff: 0 stars - the steak appetizer was the shining star of the night; lasagna was brutally overcooked; chicken milenase was just average; creme brulee was curdled! Was the Monday Night Football game a distraction? The restaurant was not busy and I counted at least 8 staff on the kitchen side of the pass.\n\nPrior, recent, visits: the crab cakes were a majority breading not crab meat. The flat bread pizza was disappointing. I had come to expect higher quality for the price that Brio commands.\n\nOverall, I'm going with the 2 stars as the floor manager was, at least, apologetic. And, I think the server deserves a chance to get things figured out.\n\nMy final frustration was that it appeared that the management and staff wanted to place all the blame for this very sub-par experience on the (newer) server. It was his fault that he was slow to greet and slow to get beverages served. It wasn't his fault that the crew charged with getting serving ware clean let a glass with a huge lipstick stain get through unchecked. It wasn't his fault that the pasta in the lasagna was as hard as tanned leather. It wasn't his fault that the creme brulee had curdled (a comp'd item and still a blow-it!).\n\nFolks, it's going to be a while before I think to come back. A shame, really. Brio was on my frequent dine-out list. Now, we'll take a pass until our out-of-town friends come back and just \"have to\" come here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is one of the best places to hang out in North Scottsdale. Great wine, an awesome happy hour, and lots of tasty, healthy food to choose from. It has a classy, dressed up vibe, while being casual at the same time and not too expensive. Great value here and service is pretty darn good too\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family and I came here during brunch time so the menu was a little different than dinner and not as many options. We got the fish and chips, lobster bisque, pesto chicken club, bruschetta sampler, and calamari appetizer (this was free for checking in). The inside of the restaurant is really beautiful and the staff are all clean and professional looking. They give you bread and butter to start which is always nice! the calamari we got was pretty bland and disappointing because the calamari itself wasn't seasoned and came with marinara sauce on one side and a mayo based sauce on the other side which had a plastic taste to it for some reason. The bruschetta didn't seem to be too popular with the family and the size seemed a bit small for what it was. The pesto chicken club was pretty tasty, the chicken is pounded out thin and well seasoned. The fish and chips were pretty good too, decent size fish filets and crispy French fries. Our server was attentive and really good with filling our waters and clearing the crumbs off our table. Overall this place is just A-ok, but not a place I'd come back to for brunch/lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe like Brio for lunch, dinner, or happy hour. We have more of a 4.5* rating, but are just a little reluctant to move it up to a 5*. We went tonight for Happy Hour. It was very crowded, in the middle of summer in Scottsdale. That alone says it is a very good place. The crispy shrimp is very good. We aren't a fan of fried foods, but make an exception for this dish. The buffalo chicken nachos are good. Brio uses their own cooked potato chips, which are very good, The potato skins are not traditional, they are quite different with a cream sauce and a minimal amount of bacon on them. We were very disappointed in the amount of bacon on the skins. The dishes are a nice small plate, but still ample enough for two people to effectively split. Perhaps the best feature of the Happy Hour menu is that it is not your standard bar offerings.  Well, the $5 good house wine ranks highly as does the Peach Sangria and Manhattan. For us sports fans, we wish they had larger and more TV's. But, they have to decide the crowd they want to attract.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdited review.  Long story short, I had an overall disappointing experience with Brio and thought that it may have just been an off night. The parent company contacted me in regard to my previous review and asked for a second chance. My wife and I took them up on their offer and enjoyed a wonderful meal, professional and friendly service, and an overall excellent experience.  If you have problem with your meal or service, bring it up with the manager (as I should have at the time) and I'm sure they will correct it. I'll definitely visit Brio again and now recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am shocked to see any negative reviews. it is a beautiful restaurant in a great location with a to kill for happy hour. Food choices are creative, portions generous and delicious. service is friendly and attentive....they really have things together here!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent service, AWESOME food, AMAZING Marian and Chef Gustavo! Very impressed with the hospitality and great food. \n\nMy children loved this place. I would definitely come here again and highly recommend this restaurant!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food here was good. I had the pork chops and vegetables. The chops were well done. My date had the lamb, which was excellent according to her. The noise level was a bit too much for an effective conversation. The restaurant is lovely but needs to be a more conversation-friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe waiter that served us on a july 4 was the ideal person for the job ,they should be proud of him working there. Sorry for not knowing to mention his name.We got there late but he still made sure everything to be on the level . \nThe food was realy good to. Starting from the tomato soup to the dishes that they had each theyre own different flavors and juicy not dry. The desserts where homemade and delicious also.\nI will go back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nMet a girlfriend for dinner here last night and had a great meal! I had the risotto with shrimp and lobster tail. Delish! It also had asparagus, mushrooms and red peppers. Service was spot on. My friend had grilled chicken with charred cauliflower. Also great. We skipped dessert but they all looked yummy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled and spoke to Crystal who was going to have her manager Brian contact me. I was looking for a place to do my co-workers retirement party. Never received a phone call back. This was going to be a party for 15+ people. Makes me laugh that they have all this money that they don't care enough to pick up the phone and call. Thank gosh for Maggiano's, they were awesome and excited to accommodate us. So if your looking for a professional place that can handle a big party. Maggiano's is your place.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I went in there for dinner this evening! We have dined into Brio a few times in the past. We love their food. The pasta vodka is my favorite! We had a wonderful experience, and great service too! We appreciated the manager stopping at our table to see how everything was. Very friendly environment! We will definitely be back to try the layer cake!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has a nice ambience and has a classy feel to it. We started our meal with a Calamari Fritto Misto which was delicious fried Calamari! They're bread was pretty special, one was made like a \"pizza\" shaped fried bread with spices on it.  We ordered a Lobster Bisque that was very tasty as well. My girlfriend ordered the Campanelle Carbonara which had grilled chicken, bacon, Parmesan cheese, spinach and Alfredo, it was done very well. I ordered the Pasta Mediterranean which had grilled chicken, mushrooms, feta cheese, spinach and tomatoes in it. So good! Definitely recommend this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Brio,\n\nAfter giving you such rave reviews back in 2009, you have kindly let me down in the most unexpected way. See I do understand that you do not take reservations for happy hour, and I totally respect that. However the fact that I came to give you a courtesy head's up that I was bringing around 40+ people over the three hour time spam for my birthday happy hour a week in advance and you kindly but adamantly let me know that you could not accommodate me left me speechless. Your friendly manager kindly explained that he did not want a \"rowdy\" group and that he wanted to keep everything orderly.  He let me know that no I could not hold two tables once I arrived and that my party would be seated separately as they came in to keep everything orderly. So no standing around and being unorderly, et al. Again the look on my face was priceless. Last I check I was almost 40 and my friends don't get \"rowdy\" but ok whatever. However I still had a friendly smile and thanked your manager for letting me know that in so many words he did not want my business and that I needed to find a new venue.\n\nYea hmm wow. No worries. I found another place that welcomed me with open arms for my birthday happy hour and they don't mind if we stand around and get a little \"rowdy\".  \n\nLove,\nEbs\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio has a great happy hour. It is only valid in the bar and patio area, but the weather is perfect to sit outside right now and it makes for great people watching. You can't go wrong with the Tuscan Tasters for $3.95 each. My favorite is the shrimp and eggplant. Best part of the meal was our waitress, Kimberly. She was so personable and had great recommendations on everything from which Sangria to chose to dipping the hamburger in the sauce that comes with the shrimp and eggplant. We will definitely be back.. And will request Kimberly.\n\n\n\n\n\nI must admit, I had high hopes for this place... and given the posh, upscale atmosphere, I was ready to be wowed. The only \"wow\" I had, however, was at how disappointed I was.\n\nThe food was far from spectacular; my Caesar salad had very little flavor (even for a Caesar salad,) and my eggplant pomodoro had just barely enough sauce to get some with each bite. The flavor on this, as well, was somewhat lacking. The spaghettini which came with it, however, was well presented and had a nice fresh flavor.\n\nThen, of course, there was the service. I would highly recommend NOT going here for a quick lunch. We ended up being there for nearly two hours, 30 minutes of which was waiting for our check. In addition, the server was rather brusque when my friend asked for recommendations.\n\nOverall, definitely not impressed. For as lavish as the decor is, and given the prices on the menu, I was expecting far better. Most certainly not recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic Happy Hour! The Caprese salad is to die for. I've only been here for happy hour but what I've experienced service-wise is top notch. Will definitely be bringing friends so they can be wowed too!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for the first time for our anniversary, and I was definitely impressed. Coming from New York, I've always been really picky about Italian food. But Brio nailed it! I got the pasta with vodka sauce, and I couldn't get enough of it. For dessert we got a creme brle, which was also delicious, and our drinks were great as well. I wish we still had a Brio in Tucson! Will definitely be back :)\n\n\n\n\n\nJust went there tonight, it was great, chic restaurant, great service.\nThe Veal was really good but the dessert part was the best, had the Tiramisu, just wished the portion was a bit bigger but it was probably the best Tiramisu I've ever had.\n\nAlso, if you're planning to get the whole roasted chicken, beware, it is a WHOLE chicken but very good though.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wanted to like this place but sadly could not.  Although customer service was good, the food was not.  I had the Pesto Pasta, which was more soup like.  I was later told that the pesto sauce is made with chicken broth.  My husband had the carbonara, which was bland, like bacon bits boiled in a cream sauce. Needless to say, we will not be back.  The place was the \"Applebees\" of italian cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave been to a Brio before and remembered it to be very good but no such luck last night. I had the Chicken Limon and we also had a double Pork Chop. The Chicken was dry, did not have any of the saut sauce as would be usual, and had very little flavor. The vegetables it was served with were inedible. No idea what was wrong with them but bitter and terrible tasting. My partner only ate 1 of the 2 pork chops as he said that was not good either. Disappointing. The bread was good, the server was very nice and attentive ... only positives ... ahh well.\n\n\n\n\n\nhad a drink at the bar. fairly priced.  dinner was very good.  ate here last year when we were in town and enjoyed that visit too.  highly recommend\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstated Classy for a corporate chain. Menu is meat heavy but at least they have calorie counts to let you know and a sub-600 section.  Chicken limone was a standout,  especially with angel hair instead of potato.  Desserts were very reasonable in price and size.  Wine list is very accessible with the sustainable IL putto a bargain. Service was great and the Table fly-by chef Jimmy was a nice touch.  Recommend\n\n\n\n\n\nI really love brio and have been coming here mug too often lately. Their food is always good.. lunch, dinner or weekend. Ranch.. yes they served brunch, who would have thought. My favorite is their happy hour, you can be sealed anywhere and don't have to fight over a chair in the bar like typical places, you can actually bring the whole family and enjoy the great food at reasonable prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio Tuscan Grill offers great food selections which are very tasty and is itself a fun place to eat!\n\nWe have come here many times and have really grown to enjoy their late-Lunch menu, along with their Happy Hour in the bar area.  We have found that they come by often and refill glasses without being asking and will give you a brief update on how long it will be before your main item is served.  It is these little things which make me give them Five Stars; that and the great tasting food.\n\nBrio has recently updated their Lunch menu to included most items for $7.95, while the HH is a flat $2.95 per item, all very good.\n\nLike most restaurants their Wait staff is very attentive mostly until it starts to get crowded.   I'm sure most restaurants do poorly at 6pm on a Friday night, but I've learned either to go slightly early or go late so to avoid the nonsense of the dinner rush.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great experience we had at lunch today at Brio Tuscan Grill at Scottsdale Quarter. Our server Scott was very professional and service was great. It was extra special when the Executive Chef Joe Milbert came to see if we were satisfied with our meal and if we needed anything. Bravo for Brio. Recommending to my friends to frequent this establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood was very average . Mines was actually cold but this is not the reason for the 3 stars only . I just don't see the hype at all for this place . Wasn't bad at all . Wouldn't return though . Just my opinion\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bartenders rock!! Brandon, Mike, and Christine rules. They always remember their customers. That's best of the best.  Also those flax crackers are unreal. One of the waitstaff always keeps me loaded.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy golfing buddies and I were starving when we arrived.  The waitress was bright and cheery.  We ordered the calamari appetizer and surveyed the wine list.  We ordered the wine and our entrees.   The waitress returned with our wine.  She said the calamari was coming and left.  Then, the servers brought our entrees.  Still no appetizer.  The waitress apologized and offered to get it, but we told her not to.  I had the Pasta Brio--excellent.  More than I could eat.  The other guys were very pleased with their meals as well.  We finished our meals and received the check.  We were charged for the appetizer.  \n\nSummary:  Nice decor.  Good dining atmosphere.  Cheery but poor service.  Very good food.  I've eaten at Brio a number of times (in Birmingham) and have never been disappointed.  Highly recommended\n\n\n\n\n\nLOVE THIS PLACE! I was introduced to them because of a Yelp event held there recently but I loved it. The patio front and side are awesome. Now that the weather is getting a little cooler here - I can't wait to go there and participate in one of my all-time favorite pastimes ... drinks on the patio! It's a perfect venue. The parking garage is right across from the entrance. So easy! Oh, and the food was wonderful as well :)\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I first ate at brio Tuscan grille in Las Vegas for our wedding reception. Today we are celebrating our wedding anniversary at the scottsdale brio Tuscan grille. The food was great as usual but the service was even better. Our server was Aaron. He was very attentive, answered all our questions and was constantly checking up on our needs. Aaron at brio Tuscan grille was awesome made the whole experience even better. ..\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a sad story of a restaurant that when first open had great food, service and prices.  Unfortunately, I have seen the prices go up and everything else go down hill.  I hadn't been there in some time because I was not impressed with the last few times I had been.  But, as someone who goes out to dinner several times a week, I thought I would give it a try.  I ordered the salmon and could not believe what a small portion it was, but even sadder was when you flipped it over it was char BLACK on one side!!!  The waiter did take it back but it should have never been served and how awkward is it for the other people at the table to eat their food???  Don't think they will see me again!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to this location on Christmas Eve we were celebrating our anniversary. Everything was good but later that evening I got really sick! Violently sick! My husband called and told them but we have not got any kind of response back! I would not recommend going there!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a nice lunch there--love the bread basket, as so few places do that anymore. Had the chicken and wild rice orzo salad. It was a huge portion and was like something I could make at home. The service was a bit slow. They gave my salad to someone else, so I had to wait. Should have comped my iced tea for the extra wait. I would go back again, but I think it is pricey for what you get. The salad is about $13--$11 would be more fair.\n\n\n\n\n\nSalmon dish is fantastic!  Every time I've been there the service is great and the food excellent. Decided to have a bridal shower there and the service was the best . Have not experienced that friendliness and help in a long time. The manager was great and very accommodating.  Would definitely do it there again.\n\n\n\n\n\nYuck!    Yet another corporate crap restaurant comes to Scottsdale.   \n\nNo better than any other chain joint, where it seems the primary ingrediant in any dish is salt.\n\nSave your money and fix a nice dinner for yourself at home with a good bottle of wine and you'll be happier for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe frequently come here for happy hours. Not exactly healthy, but very tasty and a terrific deal. Not one to rest on the laurels, they rotate their menu frequently and we are always pleasantly surprised to see their new offerings. The black pepper shrimp and eggplant is a must have -- we usually order two of them!\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a fabulous time bringing my mother here for the first time for lunch. She absolutely loved the ricotta filled pasta. I ended up eating off her plate it was so delicious! The service was great, we didn't have to wait long at all for our food. The second time I took my boss here we ended up sitting in the bar area because it was crowded. Unfortunately the service was sub par and irritatingly slow. The very very tan gentleman just.... didn't.... get... it. He took forever and a day to get items we asked for and he took even longer to get our bill. He only had to handle 3 tables. Luckily the food was great or I would have to knock the place down another star.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely my new favorite place! Just had my bridal shower there! Matthew was  great and also was Kimberly!!! Outstanding service! Exceeded my expectations!! Food was also out of the world!! Everyone was so pleased and they were beyond accommodating! Thanks guys! You're the best!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW, they sat us on time and  the food was very fresh, cooked perfectly  and tasted great and the decor made us feel like we were in Tuscany. \nMy wife and I called them Saturday around noon and made a reservation for 7:45 as we were taking some friends out for their birthday. we showed up at 7:15 to try their wine before hand. When we got there they were telling people that there was over an hour wait. However, they sat us right on time.  The wine selection was limited however, everything we tasted was excellent. The two slight negatives for us personally are that they serve Pepsi instead of Coke and I don't like Pepsi and because it was so busy, it was rather noisy which made it hard to carrying a conversation. I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE and cant wait to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought I would try Brio again during Arizona Restaurant Week to see if anything improved from my first visit.  Again,  the service was not what one would expect for this establishment.  Our drink glasses went empty and nobody noticed. I had to ask for more.  Usually, restaurants with these price points are more concerned about keeping drink glasses full. Some of the time it felt like we were on auto pilot.  I was trying to get some balsamic and olive oil for my bread.  It took awhile for the server to come back to check on out table.  The kitchen runners just drop and run.  Also, I noticed some flies in the dining room and a lady at the nearby table stood up to swat at flies.  She asked me if I noticed the flies and if I was having any trouble with flies.  There is nothing like swating flies and trying to keep them out of your dinner.  There were some very frustrating circumstances about dining here tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was our first time trying brio and it was exceptional. The service and the food was amazing! Our server Jessica was very sweet and was able to recommend great dishes. We had a little bit of everything! The lobster bisque, spicy shrimp and eggplant, and lump crab cakes were delicious and the chocolate lava and cheese cake desserts were to die for! Definitely going back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI work nearby and this restaurant never disappoints!! Also quick service, great quality meals and reasonably priced!! Staff is always friendly and professional!! Favorite is the Kale Salad or the Lobster Bisque!! It's a wonderful place to enjoy a relaxing meal as your shopping at the Quarter!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of my usual happy hour spots when I need a good drink and some good food. Came tonight expecting their $2.95 small bites menu and found a brand new HH menu :/ the prices are a bit higher but some portions are bigger than before. I ordered two strawberry mojitos (Yum! One of the few places that carries Cruzan Strawberry Rum) and toasted Ravioli. The BF got a Keylime mojito, a Manhattan (aka Bourbon on the rocks, or that's how it tasted lol) and the Brio Burger. Food and drinks were great and service was quick since we sat at the bar. Only downside was the higher prices - our bill came out to around $36 for happy hour - for two apps and four drinks....might not seem so bad, but I think we were just used to the old menu and prices. Oh well that's Scottsdale for you! :)\n\n\n\n\n\nA very nice restaurant. If you ever wonder about a good appetizer you've got to try the Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant is hands down the best appetizer there!!!\nIt is a little spicy because if the pepper, but it is delicious! I think that the eggplant just adds an amazing flavor to it and your palate will thank you. Try it and thank me later\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food here is fantastic. My wife and I eat here on a regular basis because the quality of the experience has always been so high.\n\nThe atmosphere is comfortable, and family friendly even though there is a bar off of the entrance. I would never come here with out a reservation though in the evenings because the wait times are always at least 30 minutes.\n\nThe restaurant seems to train their help well since the service levels are high being attentive to its patrons without being annoying.\n\nI highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here to celebrate my \"last fling before the ring!\"  Not only was the food fanastic, but without us even requesting, they put us in a private area away from the rest of the diners and gave us a wonderful server, Danny, who took care of everything we could possibly need.  It was a great way to spend my bachelorette weekend with all my of closest friends!\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting Scottsdale with my girlfriend and went to Brio for dinner. Had the pleasure of meeting Chef Jeffrey Perin, who gave us some fantastic recommendations. We started with the Bruschetta Quattro, a nice sample of their house-made bruschetta. We then moved onto the Fennel Sausage & Roasted Tomato Trecce Pasta, which was very flavorful and satisfying. Next, we enjoyed the 14 oz Gorgonzola crusted Bistecca, which was outstanding. The meal ended on a sweet note with a petite, peanut butter & chocolate mousse. All in all, it was a great experience and a delicious meal! Next time we're in town, we will definitely return.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was my first time at Brio. Came with a few friends and Ashley was my server! She recommended the Strawberry Fresca and it is my new favorite drink! She was so knowledgeable about the menu. She recommended a few items for me and I decided on the Gorgonzola crusted beef medallions. It was DELICIOUS! Ashley was so warm and welcoming and really made my experience at Brio special. I will definitely be coming back!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great experience we had at lunch today at Brio Tuscan Grill at Scottsdale Quarter. Our server Scott was very professional and service was great. It was extra special when the Executive Chef Joe Milbert came to see if we were satisfied with our meal and if we needed anything. Bravo for Brio. Recommending to my friends to frequent this establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica made our 8 person party so comfortable with the fine menu items we had.  Pork chops were excellent, appetizers superb in a beautiful setting.  Cream spinach/kale were fab.  Will do again and highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite places for Happy Hour. I have tried everything on the menu and it is fabulous! I love sitting outside on the patio too so it has a great ambience too! Love this place and have brought friends here that enjoyed themselves too!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has happened to this place? My husband and I went there Sunday afternoon...no  body greeted us or told be right there. I wish I would of left then...the place was dirty...no covers on electrical outlets, no tablecloth on our table...but other tables had them. The cooks looked so unprofessional with their backwards baseball caps on. The filters above the kitchen were laden with grease and dust. The food was lukewarm, but cold in spots. No flavor at all. Had to ask over and over for cream for lukewarm coffee. We used to really enjoy this place, the food was amazing...I should of went to Denny's...better food, service and quality\n\n\n\n\n\nMy girlfriends continue to like the happy hour expecially the black pepper shrimp. Just awesome! My husband likes the special lasagna night when its half price. But, if you want to know my favorite, it's Thomas K!!! He knows how to treat a woman like a princess! ! Food can take you only so far. Am I right?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review is about the service and not the food. Today, I took 2 out of town (business) guests to the Brio for lunch. On arrival , we (three older ladies) were seated promptly; the restaurant was not very busy and perhaps, this  is why our male server turned out to be a bit overbearing as he did not have enough tables to attend to. \nAs soon as we sat down and, without a second to spare, were asked what drinks we wanted. We ordered our drinks and during our conversation browsed the menu. He asked if we had been there before and explained the menu?  He must have mentioned 'desserts' at least 5 - 6  times before, during and after placing our orders so much so, I asked towards the end of the meal, if he likes desserts. He said yes he likes sweet things! Meals were brought out promptly - perhaps too quickly as, before we had time to finish our appetizers our entrees were brought to the table; however, I continued to enjoy my first course (Brio salad - which was nice.) My guests, as well, continued to eat their appetizers. But then, the server came to the table and said: \"eat your entree now as it would get cold. The salad is already cold so you  can eat it afterwards.\"  Really?  I told him I was enjoying my salad and, will have my entree afterwards. My guests were taken aback by his comment and tone.  I should have added that our 2nd courses should not have been brought out so quickly but did not; and, he mentioned 'desserts' again. Yes, tour entrees were not as warm but, we ate it without complaints. Then, whilst I was still eating, he came over to my guests, asked if she were finished and took her  plate away and said: I see you enjoyed your meal as you cleaned your plate. (Not good.) I, and my other guest continued to eat, then, he came back wanting to clear the the table - I was still trying to enjoy my wine and eat - we were not quite finished but, he took the plates away anyway and, mentioned desserts again. We skipped dessert! I should add that, on the other side of the room, there were two diners who clearly had finished eating before we arrived and they were still there when we left.  One of my pet peeves is having servers rush to take away cutlery/plates/bring the bill when one is still eating. The restaurant was not busy so, they were not short of tables; he brought the bill, I gave my cc , he brought it back for my signature. Then, less than 2 minutes he came over and said, can I take this whilst reaching over to grab the (payment) folder. I was still trying to enjoy my glass of wine by the way. I am the one - not the server - who had to ask the ladies if they wanted anything  else to drink/coffee Overall, the experience was not relaxed as we felt rushed - as if they wanted to close shop. This server acted too familiar and was a bit too intrusive . This was meant to be a leisurely (business) lunch, and not a sit down, order, and eat up quickly - but order desserts- and pay up...quickly. This review is from a well traveled individual who as dined at (too) many restaurants here in the US and internationally and, has only given 1 other negative review in over 30 plus years. Today, I  met these guests  for the first time, and suggested Brio for lunch; but, after leaving the restaurant, they said they felt uncomfortable as if \" they wanted us out of there\" quickly. I had to apologize to these ladies and said that I had been to this restaurant before but service was better.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: This is  not a 'walk to' restaurant if you are cruising Kierland....hopefully someone will think of building a pedestrian bridge from Kierland.\nA Tuscan feel upon entering - to me if smelled of crusty bread too!!\n\nI think the restaurant had only been opened a few days - so everything was quite new - including the service staff. No worries there.\n\nWe stopped in for a quick lunch - they had a great selection of salads - good portion sizes!.\nWill be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI work nearby and this restaurant never disappoints!! Also quick service, great quality meals and reasonably priced!! Staff is always friendly and professional!! Favorite is the Kale Salad or the Lobster Bisque!! It's a wonderful place to enjoy a relaxing meal as your shopping at the Quarter!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI work nearby and this restaurant never disappoints!! Also quick service, great quality meals and reasonably priced!! Staff is always friendly and professional!! Favorite is the Kale Salad or the Lobster Bisque!! It's a wonderful place to enjoy a relaxing meal as your shopping at the Quarter!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat location, reasonable prices and impressive decor BUT mediocre food. We celebrated our anniversary there and are fortunately still married. A typical chain...won't be on our revisit list.\n\nUpdate (9/20): met a friend there for Happy Hour because it was convenient...how bad could their appetizers be...they were! In fact, when the waiter acknowledge that receiving only 2 out of the 3 appetizers that we ordered was \"not bad\", we knew that our expectations (fair at best)  were met. \n\nNEVER AGAIN!\n\n\n\n\n\nAte here for the first time. The 3 of us had the salad with steak on top and it was fantastic. The lettuce was fresh and the steak was a nice cut and cooked med-rare. The portion was large enough for 2 but I pigged out. All in all a great stop for lunch and not very crowded on a Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had high hopes of decent Italian food here.  The decor is beutiful, easy parking etc.   But OMG,  this is garbage.  I had Veal Marsala with a side of linguini in aurora(pink) sauce.  So awful, I returned the dinner for a refund.\nI eat this same dish made by Italians in my small town and I have eaten this same dish worldwide.   Unedible.  Marsal sauce tasted like the brown sauce on a beef dish from the age of hot airplane food.  the linguini sauce was so awful.  I am not sure this corporate restaurant chain even has a clue about italian food.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been to Brio 2x in the last month.  My first time was because I had a gift card.  The second time was on my but obviously enjoyed it enough the first time to return!\n\nThis place is busy right up until 10PM on weekends so call ahead and make a reservation.\n\nVery neat ambiance.  Reminds me of the Venetian in Vegas.  Upscale and wide open so the noise level is slightly above average.\n\nThe food....  Yummy as can be!  I'm one who counts carbs so why am I going to an Italian restaurant?  The salmon is to die for.  The steaks are to die for.  Even the salads are yummy.\n\nService is average to a bit above.  Bottom line is that this is not the place to go to if in a hurry.  Great for a group.\n\n\n\n\n\nwent there for dinner last night, Feb 27. Definitely wasn't bad, but for the price, wasn't great either. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and in a great location of Scottsdale, nice for walking around after dinner. Waitress came to the table and offered us drinks. I asked about the beer and whether it came in 12 and or 16 oz glasses, she said only one size, a pint, OK fine and how much are the beers, she didn't know, really? I ordered the chicken pesto, presentation was very nice, chicken was dry. There are tons of restaurants in the Phoenix area and this is not one I would go back to\n\n\n\n\n\nOh goodness, where to start! We had an amazing waiter, Adrian, who started with wonderful manners and suggestions. Now the food-10/10!! My mother and I shared a pasta alla vodka (best pasta I've ever had, I promise), and my brother and father had 14 oz steaks that were not only perfectly charred, juicy and medium, but the veggies and potatoes were also seasoned quite well! I am so absolutely happy to have come to this place with my family; trs bonne!\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking into Brio is like walking into some kind of palace. \nIts highly ornate decor, combined with the well dressed staff make me feel like royalty.\n\nPrincely, I order, with a quick hand gesture shooing my waiter when finished. I'm in full character now. \nAll further communication with my server will be hand gestures, either kissing the fingers on one hand to signal bravo, or the back of my palm in a waving, dismissive manner.\n\nI do neither.\nInstead, I enter into a vegetative state, still in shock from seeing the shallow little bowl of Pasta E Fagioli they just served up. \nThen I taste it. \nThat's when I wish they would have assigned me a royal taste tester to make certain an unruly chef wasn't trying to poison his magnate. \n\nI get through the soup, but I'm still unable to speak for fear the next thing out of my mouth will be \"Off with his head!\"\n\nI've learned the hard way it's not pc to invoke the term 'head' when on a date, and in such palatial surroundings.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill a solid 4 star performer.\n\nI forgot to check in the last 2 times I was here. Silly me. I checked in last night and discovered an awesome check in deal. A free app! I don't know how long they've had this offer but it is a great deal and the app - steak bruschetta was excellently prepared, nicely plated and yummy.\n\nService was excellent, as always.\n\nCrab cakes were very well done. The quantity is a bit lacking for the price.\n\nSpecial for the night was sea bass. Again, nicely plated. Quantity was decent for the price. The fish was cooked well. Maybe just a touch over cooked. I wouldn't order again as there was a bit too much of a fishy-taste to it for my liking. Yes, I know it's fish. But, very fresh fish, prepared correctly - unless it's an oily fish (salmon) - doesn't usually leave one with a fish after-taste.\n\nDessert was their flourless chocolate cake. Oh yeah! Not cheap at around $7 per serving but it was a chocolate lover's dream.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by brio and found most everything there to be above my expectations. We went on a Monday night during restaurant week a little later in the evening, around 8 o'clock as I didn't get off work as early as I would have liked. So brio was close to home and felt a bit on the safe side. I guess my expectations were somewhat low because it's Italian food and most Italian chains aren't known for their quality.  We sat in the dining room because it felt like there was more atmosphere than there was on the patio. Our table was great, like a private booth with barrier walls on each side. The ceilings are high and chad and I were both reminded of Vegas when we sat down. Our server, Jonathan, was wonderful. Funny and attentive without being intrusive. We both had the bruschetta samplers to start and chad really enjoyed it but to be honest I was less than impressed. I mean, I ate it all and it was by no means bad, I just didn't love it. The bread wasn't crispy as is customary with bruschetta, it was just cold, but I just assumed this is how it's done here. Also I had no idea what I was eating. I should have held onto the paper. For entrees, chad had the filet and I had the lobster and shrimp ravioli. Chads filet was wonderful, even though he omitted the Gorgonzola cheese. Cooked to perfection and tasted fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed my pasta dish. And it was huge! Once again we both gobbled our entire meal right up. On board for dessert was a creme brle for me and caramel cheesecake for chad. Once again those were gone in a matter on minutes. \nBrio really has the feel of a grand ballroom and I enjoyed the atmosphere immensely. Overall the food was good and tasted fresh, which isn't often the case with Italian food. Even the bread at the beginning of the meal was good. And for restaurant week they offered a glass of house wine with the meal that was a nice added, and appreciated, touch. However, no Vegas style Italian restaurant would be complete without a little bit of tacky. The paper on top of the table clothes? Saves on laundering costs I supposed. And the way the plates say \"brio!\" across the top...? Just in case we forgot where we were. \nI would definitely come back again for restaurant week or some other offer, but I honestly can't see myself going out of my way to come here. Good experience but nothing super special.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered the Mezza Chicken Limone, and it basically was coated with an omelette. It was supposed to be a piccata, but instead of an egg wash and flour dipped chicken, it was coated in a thick layer of scrambled egg. Sent it back but was given the same again. \n\nI'm a big fan of piccata, and have ordered the same dish here before, but sadly they've forgotten how to make it. \n\nI googled an image of this dish to verify how it should be made, and there are loads of Brio images that don't include the coating of omelette. \n\nI'm now left disappointed and with a rumbly tumbly.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave eaten here many times for several years with my lunch group and always a good experience. No one has ever been unhappy with the food. Service can be spotty from excellent to slow even when the restaurant has few patrons it can be very slow. Parking is the one stumbling block so we all tend to avoid when the snowbirds are here. Shopping at the Quarter is difficult if you will need to go back and forth to your car since there is only garage parking, one way in and out.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust ate at Brio at the Scottsdale Quarter location. We love the food - my favorite is the steak salad - but the service is slow. Turnover seems to be high - we've had a different wait staff each time we've been here - and the training is lacking. My waiter tried to take my plate away before I was done eating and didn't even ask if I was done. We waited forever for our food and forever to get our check. On the way out, our waiter actually cut me off and stood in the way to pour a glass of wine for someone else. It was quite a disappointing evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here with the family while checking out Scottsdale Quarter. Food was great. Service was good. Only thing lacking was selection of draft beer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore heading off to the iPIC theater, we decided to have dinner there because it was 6 PM on a Saturday and it was busy, but we were able to get a table for 4. \nThe place reminds you have Cheesecake Factory or Cafe Lux, but the prices are a tad bit higher.\nFrom the time we sat down to the time we left, it was a great dining experience. The waiter made us feel at home. he made sure our water glasses were full. \nAs for the food, my wife had the crab and shrimp cakes and said it was the BEST she has EVER had.  I had the Grilled Shrimp with Orzo which was excellent. Presentation was beautiful and the dish had lots of flavor with the right amount of heat. Our friends shared the Grilled Salmon dish which was wonderful. \nThe manager stopped by to see how everything was and chatted with us for a few minutes.\nWhen we departed at 7:15 PM, there was a crowd at the door waiting for tables. I definitely will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nBEST. ITALIAN. FOOD. HANDS. DOWN. Had a delightful experience of Brio catering to my club's recent luncheon. The food arrived on time and the presentation exceeded our expectations. Yummy yummy. We will be sure to have it again. Shout out to Brian for helping with our needs and being so accommodating on a short notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nI cannot believe I haven't done a review on this place. I have been to this location as well as the one out in San Tan Village.  I came to an happy hour here and let me tell you, there $2.95 happy hour appetizers were yummy. The portions were huge as well. There were about 7 of us and we ordered the calamari, the crabcakes, spinach and artichoke dip and the Beef Carpaccio. All of them were quite good. I love me some calamari and when it is made just right like this order was, it takes everything in me not to eat it all! We also ordered a few bottles of wine and for the life of me, I cannot remember what they were but they were good bottles of red. A friend of ours picked up our tab which was especially sweet. (Thanks Frankie!)\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally went to Brio today, for lunch.\n\nFirst thing I said when we walked in, \"are they owned by Cheesecake Factory?\"  The atmosphere is Cheesecake Factory-esque, with a Tuscan flare.\n\nThe menu is pretty big, nothing really stood out to me on it though.  Their brunch menu items looked like they had some potential but I was not in a brunch mood unfortunately.  Had the Lobster bisque to start, pretty good, but I've had better.  (The Lobster Bisque at Ocean Club REALLY spoils you.....lol)  Sister had the Beef Carpaccio appetizer...which was HUGE.  It's a huge, long plate of thinly sliced carpaccio with a small bunch of mixed greens in the center...it was pretty good, but nothing that I went crazy over.\n\nHad the Pasta alla Vodka for entree and again, pretty good but nothing amazing.  They are little ricotta filled pasta purses (don't know the technical pasta name for them, so that's how I'd best describe them!), in a delicious tomato/parmesan/vodka sauce with smoked bacon.  Very tasty, but not life changing.\n\nFood wise, it kinda reminded me of an Olive Garden, but a little more upmarket.  Maybe if Olive Garden made love to a Cheescake Factory....you'd end up with a Brio Tuscan Grille?\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen there twice for dinner and both times were good. Big open room which gets kind of noisy, but it's a fun place. This is a chain, somewhere between Carabas and Maggianos. I tend to get the veal piccata type of dish at Italian places as a measure, and the veal here was very good. the wines were reasonable, waitstaff attentive, food was good. I looked over at my friend's lasagna and it looked gooey, sloppy, whatever to me. He enjoyed it. The prices were reasonable enough to put Brio on the list for a night out during the week.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust had another great meal at Brio Tuscan Grille in North Scottsdale. My wife is recovering from recent foot surgery and I wanted to pick up her spirits a little and I hit a home run tonight by taking her to her favorite restaurant; Brio. The food was outstanding, the pace was perfect and the service was exceptional. Hats off to Steve and Vinnie and Monique for making our evening perfect. We will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visited Brio Tuscan Grille about 20 times. I always enjoy the steak salad, lamb chops and my 6 year old grandson  loves the lobster bisque soup.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Tuscan restaurant I have ever been to! I had the gluten free pasta and it was very good. I normally can't eat pasta at restaurants due to my gluten and dairy allergies but the Brio staff were very accommodating and knew exactly what I could have. I didn't have to sacrifice flavor for a stomach ache, and that is a rare occurrence. Not only was the food excellent but the staff were delightful and very fast. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Scottsdale!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is probably one our (new) favorite Italian food places. Prices are a little high, but the service, food, and atmosphere are terrific. Last time we went, my wife's steak was overdone, and they cooked us a new one no problem, and the manager came by and apologized and bought us desert. Overall they were very friendly, and the food (and chocolate cake) were amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the environment and set-up. Trendy with a bit of class. I had there egg plant apetizer and it was amazing! The sauce was great!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have eaten at Brio's on several occasions in the past and have always found the food and service to be very good. On our visit last week, however, I found the experience to be exceptional.  I ordered the Carbonara  and it had to be one of the best I have had.  The dish included fresh spinach and chicken, delicious.  In addition, the service provided by Ashley was excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't usually like to rate chain restaurants but Brio was pretty darn good.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The pasta dishes were very good with large poritons.  I really don't have anything bad to say about this place.  Everyone seems to be mentioning the happy hour.  I'll have to come back to try that!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has now become my favorite place for happy hour! The food choices are amazing and affordable, and the portion size does not go smaller due to happy hour. We shared an amazing shrimp and eggplant dish, margarita cheesy dip with beef salad. I enjoyed the French Gimlet cocktail that consisted of pineapple infused vodka (made on site), St. Germaine, lime juice, and simple syrup infused cucumber = $6.00. A very refreshing drink for a summer day in Scottsdale! Our waiter was wonderful and I am sorry I forgot his name! Happy hour begins at 3 pm! Cozy decor! I have also experienced this restaurant for a large graduation party and they did an amazing job! Keep up the great work Brio--- I will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nCame for friend's 21st birthday. Caesar salad was so garlicky that it was inedible and left a terrible taste to start off the evening. Carbonara \"lightly salted\" was delicious, but it appears the portions have gotten smaller. Our server was very attentive and kind. Offered a complimentary chocolate dessert for the birthday boy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHmmmm. I would say our visit was a 6/10. We had a party of 10 with two waiters. Food was a 8/10. Decor and setting 8/10. Problem was food was missing from different orders and my husbands lamb dish never made it to the table until everyone else was finished eating their meal. (We were eventually told it would be a little bit before it would be out, so he asked everyone to eat while their food was warm.) The staff was polite and helpful, offering to comp my husbands dish. That is nice, but he came to dine with his party. We will pass and try somewhere else next time. There is a lot of establishment competition out there to make mistakes like forgetting someone's entire meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided to take a friend here for her birthday.  The service was not that great. I have experienced better service.  I ordered a chips and dip appetizer.  The kitchen runner dropped and ran as he spilled some of the chips off the plate onto the table.  We pointed this out to him and asked for more chips but, he did not seem to care one way or another.  I ordered Cesar salad and steak medallions for dinner.  The salad was delivered and the server did not check to see that we had everything we needed.  The table did not have a pepper grinder or salt shaker. I wanted some pepper and lemons for my salad.  It took longer than what would be expected to receive these items.  I ordered my steak medium plus and it arrived well done with a dark center.  The food was presented well but not prepared according to the order.  Plus, the entre arrived when I just started eating my salad.  It was too fast to receive the entre and the food was clustered together.  Later, the server splattered food all over my birthday guest's white blouse.  It was a mess.  The server offered her some club soda water but, she had to scrub her blouse with water at her birthday.  That is not the type of experience I had in mind for her birthday when I selected this restaurant.  Furthermore, this dining experience is not what I would expect from a place with the type of atmosphere and menu prices I was looking at.  When I see premium prices on the menu I expect premium service.  I don't understand why they were initially trying to charge me full price for this type of food and service.  We mentioned some things to the server and we ended up addressing these issues with a manager.  There should have been more consideration earlier regarding the circumstances.  I think there is some room for improvement here.  I have to say, I have had far better service at Olive Garden Restaurant.  It is a long drive to get to Brio and this place is not located in the most convenient and accessible area for the majority of the city.  There is nothing more disappointing than driving far to a restaurant and getting this type of service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crab crusted salmon special was fantastic. The portions were just right. The sourdough bread was an excellent compliment to our meal.  The atmosphere is very nice like an Italian courtyard. Will definitely come back here the next time we visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWonderful atmosphere and food.  Yes the lemonade is as good as they say!!   Great service. Reasonable prices for such great food.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a lovely lunch here with my husband recently. I enjoyed the crab and shrimp cakes with roasted vegetables ... very tasty particularly when paired with the Santa Ema Sauvignon Blanc. My husband was very happy with his Pasta Pomodoro and the service was wonderful.\n\n\n\n\n\nA favorite for happy hour.   Great food, service, atmosphere and cost.   Love the energy here.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat potential here with a nicely decorated interior. As you walk in you cannot help but feel like you're in for a treat. In the end you'll need to lower your expectations as this place is just a chain. The food is just okay and competes nicely with other Italian chain restaurants. I can tell you from experience this place comes nowhere close to the food I had in Tuscany. \n\nFun fact - the prices are 10% higher here than there location in SoCal.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame in for lunch with some friends and everything was great. Had a couple appetizers. Food was amazing as well as the service. Perfect place for any outing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Happy Hour at Brio is extremely jolly!  We love the offerings at the Brio at Town Square in Las Vegas, and thought we would try the Phoenix version of the same restaurant.  We dropped in on a Wednesday for Happy Hour  before going to a film, and were astonished by the size of the portions.  Some of the items were similar to Vegas\" menu, but the servings of the Shrimp and Eggplant and the Pizza Margarita were twice if not three times as big!  Delicious spicy shrimp and crispy flatbread pizza accompanied by two large Margaritas made for a great preview to coming attractions.\nThe space at this restaurant is also more generous, and we were able to eat inside in unhurried luxury!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have dinned here a few times, as a girls night out having some app's, dinner with another couple, lunch for a employee's birthday and then as a family for lunch with grandparent's would say that the service has varied in....when is was girls night and we had some wine and app's at the bar, our server was okay...when it was lunch it was just okay....dinner was better. Food I would say is good, it just seems like the typical big box franchise Italian restaurant that looses that special touch you find in the mom and pop type of places....\n\n\n\n\n\nOh my goodness.  Happy Hour.  So good, so inexpensive!!  We took a group of 10 for happy hour to celebrate my birthday.  Not only that, but there are Brio gift cards at Costco.  So it was quite the deal.  Between all of us, we tried everything on the happy hour menu.  Everything was really good.  My fav, beef carapaccio  was terrific and so plentiful.  There are lots of decent wines on the 5$ list.  The favorite mixed drink of our group was the Italian lemonade (vodka).\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here a few times for happy hour and am never disappointed. The appetizers are amazing and the drink specials are very well priced. I recommend the spicy shrimp!\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing service, fantastic food. Manager stopped by and was so pleased with how happy we were he comped our drinks as a thanks. Will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst visit~ We loved everything about Brio~!!! The service, food, ambiance~!!   Great HHour, etc. .\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my favorite Tuscan Grille I have ever been to! Laurence was absolutely amazing as a bartender I could not say enough good things go about him! So amazing and kind knowledgeable and patient. Then for Steve the GM he was wonderful! Thank you so so much for everything to the both of you. This experience was amazing and more than anything I have ever experienced! Thank you brio team! Especially Laurence and Steve.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I went out to dinner at Brios with my parents on Thusrday night and every one of us was very happy with our meals. The presentation and atmospher was equal to or better than any \"5 star\" rated restaurant in the valley. This was our thisrd time there and as usual the night out , the service and the food were supberb. It's always fun to go out to the Kierland area and this night was no exception. Great Italian/ Continental at reasonable prices. Try it you will love it!\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious dinner options\n\nExcellent service and attentive wait staff\n\nHad the salmon on breaded tomatoes - excellent\nWould recommend getting the side salad as there is not much in the way of greens with the dinner\n\nPAsta dishes were delicious and well presented\n\nAttentive to the children attending with us\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat time!! Our waiter, Max was amazing!! He gave great suggestions on the full meal and helped with the happy hour menu. We will be back because of the crazy good food but also because of the great service!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have gone here twice now and love it!!  It is a HUGE restaurant so you probably won't have to wait for a table.  It is just beautiful! High ceilings and big booths. I love the dcor. it makes you feel like you are in Italy!\n\nThe staff is always great and dressed very professionally.\n\nWe got the warm bread to start, then spinach artichoke dip which was great!!\n\nFor meals, I got a salad and it was huge!! Enough to take home for a second meal.  My boyfriend got a pasta dish and he loved his as well.\n\nWe went back a second time when we had family in town and they were all pleased with their meals as well. So overall, it is a great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nLovely people and amazing food! My family and I went here for my sister's 18th birthday, and it was the best birthday dinner so far! I'm allergic to quite a few things and the staff went out of their way to give me something perfect and off-menu. I was so overjoyed and surprised! Our server's name was Omida and he was amazing! This was a perfect experience for all of us! Thank you so much, Brio! Highly reccomend\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio is a great option for a medium-higher end Italian food where you can take the family. It's a bit loud but with little kids, that's fine with me. The carpaccio rivals that next door at Eddie V's and the lobster bisque soup is buttery and superb. I get the lasagna every time. Great bchamel sauce and plenty of food. Sit out front on the patio if you can, great people watching.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here for my cousins rehersal dinner and the first dish out was the lobster bisque and it was one of the best things ive ever ate !!!!!! AMAZING, I could have ate 10 more bowls of this and forget the main dish.\nthe main dish i got some chicken dish that i dont remember that well. I do remember that it was over pasta and the pasta was great, \nI also had 2 GREAT dirty martinis ,\n\n\n\n\n\nI read all the reviews and a lot of them hated the service but I had a girlfriend visiting from PA that loves Italian food so I decided to take a chance. When I made the reservation I mentioned the bad service reviews and asked for their best wait person. I have to tell you the food and ambience were superb and Ashley our waitress was excellent. She Was extremely attentive and knew the menu well. I can't say enough about how we were treated and the food was delicious - we will take visitors back but will be certain to ask for Ashley.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is not that great, Service very slow, I ordered a  Steak (medium) they brought it  medium rear, Steak had a funny taste (burned  taste, is like your eating the grill steel. I eat 1/4 of the steak and the server asked me if somethings wrong with the steak I told him that it tastes like is burned  and also is not cooked the way I want it. (Yes I we paid the full bill, and no i didn't took the steak with me. I only eat the veggies). BTW I visited this place 3 times. 1'st time steak was ok, 2'nd time we dine on the patyo it was in December, The server was very Dirty and Nasty. His mucus dropped in our plate when he put the plate on the table. My wife almost throw up. We just left the restaurant and never came back until I got invited to a B-day and I had to go and ordered the NY Steak.\n NO I will not go there again. \nIF YOU ASK FOR MORE BREAD STICKS ... They will bring you cold ones and broken, not that good like the first ones, so you don't ask for more bread sticks. I never wanted to leave a feedback for this restaurant. But I really didn't enjoy the steak. So I had to leave the feedback. If you like steak, go down the plaza and there is a steak house, You can't go wrong..\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Italian food I have experienced in Arizona and I was surprised because it's a chain. My guy and I were ooing and ahhing throughout the meal. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli with Crab insalata and it was a perfect portion, perfect flavoring and al dente! AMAZING. The only thing this place needs is Spumoni (minus the candied fruit)!!! Our server didn't even know what it was! What? i know!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've eaten here twice now for dinner about 6 months apart and my experiences have been similar (not bad, not outstanding, and I would go here again but it is not at the top of my list). The place is expansive, loud, and has an upscale chain-like feel to it and it is very busy around the Happy and Dinner hours. My group scored some seats in the bar on my last visit while waiting for our table and I will give them good marks for some straight forward and affordable adult beverages. \n\nThe luster decreases a bit in the dining room. The decor is upscale in appearance but the service and volume detracted from that. Servers were not always around when you were looking for them and the noise level was so high that our table of 4 could barely hear each other and had to keep leaning in throughout the evening to ask the person speaking to repeat themselves. It was my impression that the servers were short-staffed (I literally saw 2 of them at close to full sprints on a few occasions trying to get back to the kitchen to pick up ready meals at the pass) while our table sat unattended to. The noise level was accentuated by the lead chef who was expediting by occasionally yelling (literally screaming) at the kitchen crew. It was entertaining at first as I like to watch chaotic kitchens get their rhythm but this did not occur throughout our meal and the outbursts became a little distracting after a while. \n\nThe menu is a bit unfocused in my opinion and seems like it tries to offer something for everyone as American chain restaurants like to do. Portion size is good and the food was tasty but not over the top great. One gripe is that their $6 side of Brussels sprouts was pretty measly and it took about 45 min for food to hit our table. That sort of confirmed for me that the kitchen did not have its act together on my last visit.  \n\nIn the end, I think an \"A-OK\" rating of 3 stars is right on. I've had better and worse meals in my life and I like enough aspects of Brio to go back but it is not the place that I think of first when searching out dinner in Scottsdale.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are way better original italian places to go...I promise\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there last night and had a better experience than prior.   We started off with the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip with parmesan flatbread.   YUMMMM!   Not too much of a garlic taste to feel as thought I would have garlic breath but just enough to taste it.   Correct combination of spinach and artichoke hearts.   Chunks of artichoke that I appreciated.  My companion had the Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine  and I had the Shrimp Mediterranean.   Both dishes were delish!    I had the shrimp dish prior and enjoyed it; therefore, I had it again since I had basically pigged out on the warm sour dough bread and flatbread and the dip and parmesan flatbread.   The fettuccine had the smaller shrimp than mine and lobster and the correct combination of cheeses and spices.   I would order that next time.\n\nOur server was Jonathan in the bar since we would have had to wait for seating in the dining room and there were plenty of booths and tables in the bar with no wait.   Jonathan was very competent, efficient and friendly.\n\nI definitely will be going back, that's for sure!\n\n\n\n\n\nI should have written this earlier as it has been over a month but the poor service was memorable enough to have me writing this a month late.  I chose to go to Brio for my birthday dinner after having had lunch their with my mom.  So here are my two reviews:\n\nLunch: Service was slow to get started but once our waiter started he was great.  My mom and I shared the bruschetta quattro and the Insalata Roma.  The Bruschetta's were good and the salad was excellent.  We also shared some mini chocolate dessert that was as good as those little shot glass desserts get.  We really enjoyed sharing the bruschetta and experiencing the different flavors.  The atmosphere  was wonderful so I wanted to try dinner.\n\nBirhday Dinner: My husband had called ahead of time to make reservations and let them know it was my birthday and that we would want some sort of birthday dessert.  When we arrived we were seated right away.  As I was reviewing the menu I watched the table across from us as they seemed to be having some trouble and the manager was getting involved.  10 minutes later, after no service, we asked that waiter of the table across from us if he could find our waiter.  Turns out, it was him.  Great.  He finally came over and got us started.  \nMost of our food was good.  Let me point out what wasn't.  My daughter ordered a side caesar salad with her meal.  When it came, there was no dressing.  Let me clarify.  It wasn't lightly dressed, it had no dressing at all.  Just a bowl of lettuce with a couple of croutons.  My mom ordered the Penne Mediterranean which was completely flavor-less.  My husbands \"surf and terf\" was supposed to come with crispy potatoes, but they were missing from his plate when we were served.  Upon asking the waiter had no clue that they should have been included with the meal.  I will say that when they did arrive, they were our favorite part of our meal.  They forgot to note my birthday so we ordered the Dessert Trio to share and all of those were quite excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy review is for the Happy Hour.  We were lucky enough to score a table as we got to Brio at exactly 4pm, had we waited 15 minutes and we would have been out of luck.\n\nI'm usually skepticl when it comes to HH menus but this place is amazing.  The food was $3 or $4 bucks a plate and the drinks around $5 depending on what you got. \n\nThe selection was fantastic and even better was the service.  There was 6 in our party and we ordered quite heavily on both the food and drink menus.  Our server was on top of it.  He was pleasant and friendly and really added to the experience.\n\nThe food was out-friggin-standing.  We got the pepperoni/sausage flatbread and it was defnitely a favorite amongst everyone.\n\nThe deep fried raviolis were top notch too.  We got the lettuce wrap cups and sliders.  \n\nWe also did dessert, I did the marscapone cheesecake and it was amazing.  \n\nI am now confident I will return many, many times.\n\n\n\n\n\nA group of us went for AZ Restaurant Week. I am not sure if it was all the large graduation parties or lack of experience with the Restaurant Week menu but service was a disaster. We waited 15 min for a first drink and it only got worse from there, finally after our dinner was served before our appetizer and we refused it, a manager stepped in and things got a bit better. We really appreciated his help.\nThe food was really good which made it extra disappointing that things were so disorganized. Additionally on both of the plates that included vegetables, the veggies were cold. By then we had given up trying to get things right. \nWe were there just under 2 hours for a very basic meal. The waiter was very apologetic once he caught up but I am not sure if I would try it again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here for lunch right after Christmas.  The building is beautiful.  You feel like you're eating somewhere in Vegas.  I ordered the lobster bisque soup and the caesar salad.  The table bread was great.  The taste of the lobster bisque was good but it didn't have any lobster chunks.  My friend ordered the vodka pasta - it had bacon in it which we weren't expecting although it was good.  We ordered the molten chocolate cake - very good - and two cappuccinos, also good.  Because it was my birthday, they brought us a free mini tiramisu.  Except for the amazing interior decor, this place is your standard italian restaurant with standard fare.  I would return again for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here a few times, and we've had issues before but this takes the cake!  We sat in the private area due to the amount of people already dining.  Totally fine, Brio does have a nice private/patio area with a fireplace. After sitting for awhile, my friend found feathers in my hair which was really odd.  But then, a bird pooped on my arm- it is good luck and we were in an Italian restaurant.  The dove was stuck up in the rafters and could not leave the area.  The server did know the bird was in the rafters, but didn't seem to care either way.  I didn't make a big deal out of it, just odd.   I moved to another chair and below the chair was a woman's feminine product-wrapped.  Again, odd.  Then we got our food.  The roasted chicken was pretty dry and over cooked.  This is the second time, I've ordered a meat entree and both times, the meats were under cooked or overcooked.  To top the night, I chip a tooth.   I'm not sure if I will go there again, never really a great experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been here twice now, but a year apart. The first time we went it was excellent, we had an amazing server, and the food was spot on. This time it seemed a little off. We all seriously ordered the same things as last time, it took us a few moments to realize it. I was excited as their Pesto Chicken Salad was amazing the first time I had it. \n\nSO the run down..\nMother in Law ordered the crab cakes, and they were excellent. The roasted veggies that came with it had me jealous. \nSon ordered the pesto pasta and really enjoyed it as well.\nHusband ordered the salmon salad and it was a little over done and charred. I would have said something, but he isn't the type to complain. \nI ordered the pesto chicken salad, The chicken was a whole chicken breast thinly sliced into two, which is more than enough meat for me. The only issue is, by doing this it made the chicken VERY DRY and VERY TOUGH. I was really disappointed as it was perfect the time before. \n\nIt was a 50/50% split on food. There are too many other great places, I think we will try somewhere new next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Brio!\nI eat here several times a month, sometimes lunch, sometimes happy hour and often dinner. The staff is always friendly and efficient. I voted for Executive Chef, Joe Milbert's fabulous Autumn pasta dish and he won a trip to Italy over all the other chefs who entered. He is now the acting General Manager and is doing an excellent job in an extremely busy position. \nThe food is always delicious. Today I am wolfing down my favorite wedge salad anywhere, the Bistecca, but at happy hour, my choice is often the super good burger. All the servers are upbeat, and give us extra good service!\nI will be looking for you, join us at this lovely restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived Thursday Dec, 22, 2011 without reservations at 6:45pm, which may be a bit early for this place. The bar was packed, the dining room had lots of empty but reserved tables.\n\nWe got decent service, about 10 minutes till our salads arrived and 32 minutes until our meals arrived. \n\nEasy parking in the garage across the street.\n\nI would go back anytime, it was a good meal and good service.\n\n\n\n\n\nResonable price \n\nService team was challenged being short handed\n\nFood was good for the $$\n\nNot bad \n\n\nyelp requires a novel for a review to get posted - Its like yelp is a frustrated former English teacher make you write a 10k word term paper when a one pager covers the topic\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here with a big group from work for lunch last week. There were 3 servers assigned to our table, and they were all friendly. They were also pretty good about keeping all of our drinks filled, especially considering there was 12 of us.\n\nI was trying to be healthy, so I ordered the tilapia and roasted vegetables. It was surprisingly good and had a little spicy kick to it. Plus, the portion size was very generous. Everyone else seemed to be pretty happy with their food too.\n\nAlthough I had a good experience, I don't think it was anything special, especially considering the prices. If I had to actually pay, I think I would have been a little disappointed. All in all, it's not a bad place, it's just missing that certain something to push it up to 4 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove to come here for HH and all their great appi's. Tonight was first time coming for dinner and we were not disappointed.  Our waiter, Danny was personable and attentive and only here to make everything to our pleasing. The spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer is our favorite and what keeps bringing us back. And we love to bring our out of town guests in to enjoy it as well. Enjoyed Danny and the whole staff!  Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\nI shouldn't give this away because I hurt my chances to get a good table, but I'm a good person and not too selfish so I'll let you in on the best happy hour in town. You can get wine for $5 and hold on...angus beef hamburger for $5. So delicious. Make sure you share with a really good friend or special someone in your life. A truly great time. Thanks brio!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Macaroni Grill food with the Cheesecake Factory ambiance and you have Brio.  Went on a Friday night at 8:00 and about 10 of the 60 plus tables were occupied.  Bad sign.  Service was spotty...about on par with an Appleby's (no disrespect to Appleby's). If there were any specials or specialties, we weren't told about 'em.  Lobster bisque was below average...too thick.  Caesar salad was good.  Roasted lamb chops were terrible for $29.  Asked for medium rare, came out medium.  Also gamey.  Shrimp and lobster fettuccini was flavorful...I'd give it a 6.5.  Great location but will not return.  Too many better choices close by in the price range.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the upscale feeling...and the outdoor seating for great people watching. Great after work happy hour spot, with happy hour specials on appetizers and drinks. Food tastes very fresh and homemade.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been to Brio for both dinner and happy hour, and enjoyed both experiences.  The happy hour tasting menu has a bunch of items for just $2.95!  We had the burger, margharita flatbread, shrimp and eggplant and the steak bruschetta....all were really good and decent sized portions.  But make sure to get there early to snag a table, it is first come, first serve seating in the bar area and only goes until 6 pm!\n\nThe only thing that I have had a Brio so far that I would not suggest is the lobster bisque.  I absolutely adore lobster bisque, but this version was so thick...you almost had to chew it!  Other than the bisque, the food has been perfect, seafood risotto, Gorgonzola lamb chops....all excellent.  And if you still have room for dessert...you must try the caramel creme brulee....it is amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to love this place, but I just don't.\nEverytime I eat here, I wish I were eating at Olive Garden....\nFor a chain, I just don't have any memorable items that I'd come back for (as opposed to Olive Garden's crack like breadsticks)\n\nMeh\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to most restaurants in Kierland Commons, Brio Tuscan Grille continues to offer a good value and a nice time for Happy Hour!  The other restaurant that is good for HH is Tommy Bahama's.\n\nWe come here probably once a week or so before a movie and the Happy Hour is great!  Wine is reasonably  priced around $10.00 while all the appetizers are $2.95.  Carpaccio, Ravioli Caprese, Flat bread sausage and peperoni and sirloin sliders, et cetera all for $2.95!  Nice!\n\nBrio recently began offering $5.00 Martini's on Wednesdays.  The only problem with the Brio is the bar area has limited seating.  What they really need to do is give some thought to expansion because the outdoor seating just doesn't always work well.  So get their early!\n\nOur most recent tab came to $35.63 before tip.  Good food, good drinks, good value!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nAlfredo sauce was awesome, they use parmigiano reggiano!\nI had them make me a custom pasta, rigatoni with alfredo and crumbled sausage.\nMy girlfriend and I shared a single entree which was huge for both of us and cost.......$12!\nCheaper than any entree there!\nService was good, she took a while to get our initial drink order. But after that she was great. Hooked us up on some free alfredo bread dipping sauce and a cheap entree, so she got a good tip!\n\ni will go back and hopefully it will be just as awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy experience last night was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. My friend and I showed up at 7 for a mutual friends birthday dinner. #1. We were not greeted when we walked in. #2. While it was a large party we waited nearly an hour to order food. #3. We had to ask our waitress three times for bread and waited twenty minutes for that. #4. Four of us got the three for 27.95 meal, two others at the end of the table got appetizers. Those of us that got the deal ordered salads. Our salads sat in the window for almost 45 minutes before they were brought to us. At that point they were soggy because of the dressing sitting so long on the salad. #5. Our entrees took another about 40 minutes to come. And some people got their sides and some didn't. One girl didn't get hers until she's finished her meal. My friends Brussels sprouts were burnt. #6. I asked for our check before dessert. At this point it was about 9:15 and we hadn't even gotten a water refill. We finally left at 1015. Because two of us had moved down one seat the waitress had trouble with who got what drink, although she had asked us for clarification. I finally got up and got a manager, shorter, balding man. Who when I asked if he was a manager, did not immediately ask me how he could help me. Which I found a weird response to a customer who has gotten out of THEIR SEAT TO COME FIND YOU Nor did he ever come to our table and apologize for the slow/poor service. I couldn't believe it took so long to get our checks, or the amount of time it took to get our food. We had a waiter and waitress working our table and it still took forever. While the food was good I am big on customer service and felt the lack of it isn't worth my return to the restaurant. Horrible experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio was the perfect choice for our goodbye dinner before my husband traveled to Italy. The casual atmosphere was great for our kids and we loved the free appetizer with the Yelp check in. My daughter loved the Chicken Milanese and I enjoyed the light Shrimp Verduta. The Bisteca Insalade was a meal unto itself, but I would not include Brio in the category of Italian restaurants that gives you portions far too large for anyone to finish. They were busy and a few times we waited for our server, but overall we would recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe hosted an event in Brio's banquet hall last night and it was wonderful! From the start, Adam (one of the Banquet Managers) was thorough and dedicated to making our event just what we wanted. Excellent service by servers Marion and Samantha. They were truly dedicated and went above and beyond...Marion was there early and jumped right in to help us in every way, and Samantha was great at ensuring the food/beverages were at par and served timely. Brian (another manager), was great at checking in throughout the event.\n\nWe hosted over 30 faculty/staff members from our school and couldn't be more pleased. They had a great time! For delicious food, great service, and an excellent price...definitely look into Brio for your next event!!\n\nGreat work, Brio Staff!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur last night in the Phoenix area and this was our last stop! I had already eaten a trillion times that day and the whole week--needless to say I wasn't as hungry as I normally am. On  tjhis certain Friday night after 7pm, the restaurant was very busy and there was a wait. What I did like about this restaurant is they take your phone number and they will notify you via text when you table is ready. We had a 40 minute wait so this gave us plenty of time to shop! The hostess was very nice! After about 35 minutes of waiting/shopping at the mall, a text was sent to let me know my table would be ready soon and to start heading back. My husband grabbed the table before I made it back but the hostess kindly directed me to our table. Once seated it took our waiter a moment to get there---hey were busy so I understand. He finally came and took our drink orders while we looked over the menu. I tried their pink lemonade (not sure what the lemonade was mixed with) which was delicious! One thing that I did not like was our waiter waited until we waited for a while, placed our drink order, had a our drinks refilled, and placed our food order before he brought bread to our table. For the most part he was very nice. Our food arrived and I ordered a Brio Chopped salad and added a side of grilled chicken to go with it (only three dollars or so to add chicken to a salad). My salad, the chicken, and the restaurant dressing was very good! My daughter got the kids pizza which was the size of an adult pizza that could feed two people--at least! Her pizza also had fresh ingredients and tasted good. My husband ordered a Strawberry Balsamic Chicken Salad--which was soooooo good! My mother in law ordered a Caesar salad and barely received any salad in her bowl. The waiter was nice enough to take the salad back and have them add more salad to her bowl. The original salad she received ordered was very skimpy on the portion--I am not even sure if it was a joke or not. Although we didn't order any of their major menu items, the items we did ordered were really good. I am not a major Italian restaurant eater, but when I return to the Phoenix area and have a larger appetite for Italian, I will be sure to give them another try.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, I will say that our server Austin did a great job, and our lunch was very good.  \n\nUnfortunately, what would have been a great experience turned negative quickly.  I watched a waitress REPEATEDLY go to the banquet side of restaurant and play with her eyeball in the mirror.  I don't know what her issue was, but it didn't stop her from bringing bread and tea to her tables without washing her hands.  So gross.  I considered speaking to a Manager after to let him know how grossed out I was.  Right before we left, I saw what I later learned was the floor manager go to the same banquet room, remover his shoe play with his laces, put his shoe back on, and then put his hands in the window to kitchen to pull food to be run.  How fricking nasty??!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to brio for a nice dinner. it had great service (as to be expected). Server knew his \"script\" well, but didn't know much else about the dishes. I ordered the Shrimp Verduta and my girlfriend ordered the sweet potato something risotto. we also had the quattro appetizer of bruschetta.\n\nThe bruschetta was ehhh, nothing special it, was all really standard dishes. The steak one had a nasty smokey tanginess to it that i didn't like. Overall i was not impressed by any of the four types of bruschetta.\n\nMy dish was alright, i could have made something a lot better on my own. I would eat it again, but i would not order it (if that makes sense to anyone). Shrimp was cooked nicely, the sauce was just there.. it wasn't anything to tell anyone about at all.\n\nMy girlfriend's dish was wack. I didn't like it at first. It tasted a lot better as a leftover the next day. I don't think it is something i would order again or even eat if i got it for free.\n\nThis place is nice to go, but not for a romantic date. It is too loud, i would call it a step up from carraba's. It was really busy there, 20-30 minute wait for a table for 2. Next time i am going to do italian food in that area i'm going to maggiano's.\n\nAt least i had a free appetizer's ticket from the yelp event earlier this year! sweet...\n\n\n\n\n\nI am gluten free and had the most amazing pasta lunch here for my birthday. I honestly never thought I'd taste anything that delicious again after I got diagnosed as having celiac disease. I literally day dream about my last meal at Brio and can't wait to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI met a friend for a bite to eat and a shopping day. I got a brunch item a poached egg with a shrimp/crab cake on the side with some potatoes. A mixed berry lemonade. This place was really nice, and the food was really good. I heard from a friend that their dinner menu is good as well, can't wait to try it next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally pretty interior! It was all decorated for Christmas when I went today.\n\nI went with a friend because we were in the Scottsdale Quarter and were craving bread. We went in around 4:30 and it was pretty slow (awkward time). We got a bread basket and it had a half loaf of white bread and some crispy flax/rosemary crackers. The bread loaf was warm and good to satisfy our craving. It wasn't crusty bread, but it was good enough. We asked were oil and vinegar and they brought it out promptly!\n\nWe ordered the Strawberry Balsamic salad ($15) to split. It was good, but standard. Came with strawberries, gorgonzola cheese, balsamic dressing, grapes, and candied pecans. Definitely overpriced, but it's all we ordered so whatever. Service was good, we had Ethan.\n\nMight go back for happy hour, but it probably won't be my first choice restaurant--more of an \"in the area so it's convenient\" type.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Brio for Happy Hour.  We arrive early because of the crowds.  However in the summer, the Grille has ample seats.  We ordered carpaccio, spicy shrimp and tomato flatbread.  Everything came quickly and looked great.  The carpaccio comes with greens and is pleasing to the eye.  We loved the shrimp dish.  Pieces of fried eggplant sat below the shrimp.  The sauce that accompanied the shrimp is out of this world.  There is a plateful of flatbread that was good as well.  The three dishes were more than ample for a dinner. My only slight complaint was I had to ask for another glass of water but this was minor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappen to show up during happy hour and was pleasantly surprised with the great deals they were offering! Our server was nice and it was not crowded at 3pm on a weekday. The food was delish too!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have enjoyed lunches here and decided to take my Aunt and Uncle for a special dinner. The ambience is beautiful, the server was cheerful and seemed attentive.\n\nWhat was disappointing was the cold food. Everyone in the party had cold food, except for my pasta meal. My Aunt's grilled chicken was very dry and seemed over cooked and cold. how does that happen. Was it the server? Was it the cook? \n\nThe Alfredo fettuccini was a side dish and we know why. It tastes like an Applebee's sauce. It's good, but not enough Parmesan cheese flavor. Worse...it was cold. \n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the sourdough bread, special crackers, and butter served while waiting.\n\nI guess we will stick to lunches. The lobster bisque is amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was my third time at Brio in Scottsdale. The quality of the food has taken a nose dive. \nWe were a party of 5. My pasta dish was served warm - not hot. The side kale salad was mediocre - at best, One of my friends ordered a pasta dish with chicken. It was served without the chicken (Hello). My guess is that the chef has never had real Italian food. They seated us a the only table in the (fairly empty) restaurant on which the sun continued to shine. So my friend had to keep shifting her chair around the table to avoid being blinded by the glare. Sadly, I was the one who recommended Brio, as it was my birthday. I must say that the dessert was delicious. The waiter was attentive, but he should have moved us to another table. Disappointed BIG TIME.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for birthday dinner with my daughter, along with wife and mother-in-law.  Had been here before for happy hour and it was pretty decent but we only ate appetizers that time. Decided to give it a try for dinner.\n\nSince it was a special day, we went all out.  Drinks, appetizers, salad, entrees, and one dessert.  All in all, the food was only fair (except the shrimp and eggplant appetizer-wonderful!) and we were pretty disappointed.  Over $200 with the tip left me with sticker shock as well.\n\nBottom line - if you want Olive Garden quality food, go to Olive Garden and save yourself a bunch of money.  Or...stick with happy hour and some appetizers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI go here regularly for their salmon salads and steak salads, so good!, never have any issues. I had a little situation last time with my food (my half empty lobster and shrimp bisque had no shrimp, and my steak salad came out with cold steak, half the salad drenched with sauce, the other half dry), and I asked our waiter (who was very nice and a good waiter) if he could get a manager over to us. Being a regular, I was curious if they had switched chefs or something since I was having so many issues. She saw my salad, apologized, and brought me back a new fresh one immediately (waiting there the whole time while it was being made). She also took care of our lobster bisque. Great food, and great customer service, gives then 5stars. Every restaurant has an off day here and there, but the way the situation was handled will keep me a regular at this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio Tuscan continues to offer the best tasting, best value Happy Hour in and around the Kierland/Quad area of Scottsdale. The other Happy Hour restaurant we would recommend would be Tommy Bahama's.\n\nHappy Hour at Brio run from 3 to 6, Monday thru Friday. \n\nThey have for $4.00 Bruschetta and Margherita Flatbread (photo); for $5.00 they have a fabulous tasting Beef Carpaccio with capers and aioli mustard (photo), Tomato Mozzarella Salad, Potato Skins (photo), Buffalo Chicken Nachos and a whole lot more. See menu photo. \n\nBrio continues to offering $5.00 Martini's on Wednesdays and Wine on Thursdays.  Their only shortcoming continues to be their minuscule bar area with limited seating.  What they really need is to consider is an expansion, because the outdoor seating just doesn't work well in the winter, when our snow bird friends arrive. \n\nOur most recent tab came to $23.75 including taxes, but before gratuities.  Good food, good drinks, good value!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodating hostess Kylie and the most wonderful and helpful server, Jessica, we've ever had!  She made a suggestion for just a little more food knowing we were already full on appetizers, which were already out of this world, to try the lobster bisque soup. Yum. We will definitely come back to this location again.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery disappointed by Brio last night. Had horrible service from the get-go when entertaining clients. 2 different parties of 4 who came in after us got served drinks long before we did. After we brought this to the attention of our waitress she was extremely unapologetic and in fact showed a markedly soured attitude towards us after that. We flagged down an also unapologetic seem-to-be manager, who first pointed to our waters joking that we \"did have our drinks\" and then got very busy describing how he kept glancing over at us during his walk thrus and everything seemed okay... weird that he was so defensive. His (wrong) \"impression\" is besides the point. .. He offered to \"buy us the round\" but never checked on us again. In fact,  we had to ask that the drinks be taken off when the increasingly snarky waitress didn't know a thing about it when presenting us with the check. All in all bad, unfriendly, non-empathic and disrespectful customer service. No fun to encounter flippant staff with an attitude. I will be telling my friends about this experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here for happy hour and the place is superb. Our server Nikki is top notch and was very attentive. This place is lucky to have her as she is a valuable asset to their team. The food was exceptional and the price was great. The atmosphere was good and we had a great time. We will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've had great food from Brio. I guess I can't comment on the atmosphere because I always get my food to go, but it's similar to (the decor, table size, general layout) a Cheesecake Factory on the inside (I'm being an asshole-specifically because some guy was all 'I'd pass, Cheesecake Factory atmosphere' am I the only one who thinks Cheesecake Factory isn't so bad? I mean yeah they're a chain, but they're always pretty well kept? Whatever.) - clean, all of the wait staff are friendly. I always deal with the bartender and he's a nice guy. All of the food I've had had been delicious. The desserts have been a personal favorite, but the quinoa chicken pesto salad for lunch was also delicious and decently priced for the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife had a friend visiting from out of town so last night we decided to go out to eat at Brio.  My wife had eaten there once several years ago and my wife had purchased some Brio gift cards at Costco.\n\nWe were very disappointed in the food.  For a fancy restaurant we expected a lot better.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Milanese, which is basically Chicken Parmesan.  The chicken is sliced very thin and then breaded and fried until it is quite tough.  It's probably over-fried.  3 weeks ago I had a root canal with a permanent crown attached 10 days ago.  I was seriously scared that chewing this chicken would knock my crown off.\n\nMy wife got the Balsamic Braised Short Rib.  She liked her meal and because she liked it, this rating is 2 stars and not 1 star.\n\nMy wife's friend got one of the pasta dishes.  I'm not sure which one.  But much of the pasta was all stuck together. into a solid lump.  She only ate part of the meal.  She complained to the waiter who told her that that's how the pasta should be because the sauce forces the pasta to stick together.  But after he cleared the plates, we could see the waiter showing the plate of pasta to someone from the kitchen.  Soon the manager came out to our table explaining that the pasta was over-cooked and offering to get her more pasta.  She declined as we had already finished our meal and had been in the restaurant an hour and a half by that point.  The manager wasn't offering to bring her the same dish prepared right, but  just some more pasta.  Like she wants to eat some pasta by itself.\n\nThe manager said he'd give us a discount on our bill for the bad pasta dish.  When we got the bill, it was an insult...  a $3 discount on a $79 bill.  When something bad is served and the manager admits it was prepared wrong,  it should have a greater discount.  With this insult, it would have been more respectful to have not offered any discount and just let us believe the quality of the food is bad.  Now we know the quality of the food is bad and the manager is disrespectful.\n\nAnd I didn't even mention how bad my Chicken Milanese was.\n\nBut my wife was happy with her meal and one thing I've learned in my marriage is if my wife is happy, then I'm happy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Decor is NICE , staff was nice and attentive. Food is amazing . This is one of my favorite Resturant .\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy hour: love the lounge and patio atmosphere. $5 cocktails and $2.95 appetizers! The shrimptini and spicy shrimp & eggplant appetizers were awesome as were the peach bellinis. The shrimptini was refreshing though a bit heavy on the dressing, and the spicy shrimp & eggplant was gooooood, as in I-want-to-dive-into-a-pool-filled-with-this-stuff-and-eat-my-way-out kind of good! Get the ravioli caprese if you dig Costco frozen meals and hate caprese - i.e. there was virtually no caprese. The formaggio was also kind of bland, which says a lot since I am an asiago lover. I still love you, Brio, and I suppose I can't really complain too much since $30 (including tip) got me a round of drinks and four appetizers. Still my numero uno at Scottsdale Quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst service. Had a baptism gathering there n had about 40 people and they gave us two servers only n just asking for drinks it would take so long. Also the food they said it was a family size but it wasn't because it wasn't enough for half of the people we had!!! And when asked to bring more it took them more then 20 minutes to bring more food to the table when they should of been prepared!! I'm sorry but I know for next time to not bother coming here anymore!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio is the perfect restaurant to visit after a long day of shopping! In fact, when the Quarter first opened up and H & M arrived, my sister and I made it a girl's night out and after several hours of shopping at H & M, enjoyed wine and dinner on the patio at Brio. It was such a fun night and the Brio patio was calm and relaxing. \n\nFast forward a couple of years and now the Quarter is thriving with many more shops and restaurants, but Brio still remains a favorite to me. I think this is the perfect restaurant for families who have kids and want to have a nice dinner at a restaurant, but in an environment where the kids won't stand out if they get a little louder than normal. This is also a perfect restaurant for a date night on the patio or when you have friends in town or need a nice dinner spot for one with the parents. It's really a good all-around restaurant, especially the patio! \n\nThe food here is hearty, filling and tasty Italian cuisine. My go-to favorite dish are the lobster raviolis. I don't know what they do to the sauce, but it's a perfect combination of creamy and sweet and goes perfectly with the ravioli. I really enjoy their chopped salad as well and it has a perfect blend of fresh veggies. For dessert, you must try the chocolate souffle. Oh my! I go into the evening planning on having one bite and find myself having 10!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am so sick after eating here today. The plates and silverware were dirty. I tried to ignore it and just eat the food. The tomatoes were brown. I asked our server if they were meant to be that color and she replied surely yes. It is now 5 hours later and I am puking my meal up and have no appetite.  My boyfriend is just as sick and we will never go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess two stars says \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that's exactly how I feel about this place. \nPros: familiar chain restaurant that can be back-up plan in a new town, large food portions, descent happy hour, consistent service, good place for gift cards?\nCons: food is bland, definitely  inconsistent the 3 times I have been there!\n\nI remember the first time we went there was the first month they had opened and for some reason, I recalled the food being amazing! I was excited for a new great italian restaurant, however, the next time I visited the quality of food had gone down dramatically! I went there again, for a birthday, hoping that the food would be as good as the first time and I was definitely disappointed!\n\nI also tried the Brio in Tucson, Cleveland, Colorado, and I think it's a better  place than cheesecake factory, but not as good a maggiano's.... butt if you are in a new town for a meeting, you can trust that you will get mediocre food from a reputable place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a pleasant surprise! We really enjoyed the food but did let the manager know the service was sub par. Thomas absolutely made things right. No excuses! We will for sure be back!  That is the way to run a business.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the food. The service is very good. So far one of the only places that prepare the Pasta just perfect. Down side is that its a bit pricy for pasta.\nBut I highly recommend it...dont forget the deserts are great..\n\n\n\n\n\nJust thinking about the lobster bisque makes my mouth water.  My food was excellent, the service was great too.  Highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk food. Ok service. I had the lobster bisque which was good but only one piece of lobster. My husband had the rotisserie chicken, good but dry. Our server was nice but every time she approach d the table she must have decided we were ok, so she turned and walked away before communicating. Food came out quickly but almost too quickly between courses. I will probably try out another place in Scottsdale before returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and felt so disappointed with our visit. I'll start with three positive things. The bartender was friendly and efficient. The young hostess was was also happy and friendly . And, my niece was offered a free dessert for her birthday.\nI wish I could say the same things about the waiters as I did about the bartender and hostess. Initially we were told we would have two waiters as our group of 9 people was a large table. Good sign right? Wrong, we rarely saw one of the waiters. The waiter forgot to get drink orders from half the table and then forgot to bring out drinks that were ordered. Before dinner bread was placed on the table. A small plate with 4 pieces of bread...for 9 people. The waiter looked confused/angry when we asked for enough bread for everyone.\nThen the food arrived. The food came out at various times, one meat dish undercooked,one pasta dish very overlooked and mushy and one of the salads hardly resembled what was listed in the menu. The rest of the food was mediocre. I don't know what was happening in the kitchen that night. We were there on a Sunday night and the place was packed.\nI wish I had better things to say. Like I said, we heard good things about the restaurant. Maybe they were having a very off night.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio Tuscan Grille is one of my favorite restaurants. So much so that I drive from Tucson to Scottsdale to go there. Their service is great, setting is fancy and food is perfect. They serve a loaf of bread and chips before the meal. I'm an east coaster who values good seafood and they have one of the best Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine I've had in Arizona. Their Lobster Bisque is also a favorite. Paired with their new zesty Watermelon Margarita. For dessert I order the chocolate cake that has fudge in the middle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the day I had dealing with lousy customer service reps, this was an oasis of awesome. Our server Michael was truly excellent. Funny, attentive and knew the menu. Made great recommendations. We loved our food. I had the lobster fettuccine and my husband had the pesce piccata. Love! Also try the raspberry monitor. A prefect experience start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy sister and I had passed this restaurant on the way to my job and decided to try it out. I had the calamari fritto and she had the salmon. Both were terrific with just the right portions and seasonings! I would strongly suggest eating here as it is well worth the try.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had heard from several people the food here was good.  As I travel to Italy often I'm fairly picky about Italian food but am willing to make allowances for Italian-American restaurants.\n\nI had the lobster bisque which wasn't terrible but not great either.  A little too peppery and some pieces of what seemed to be dried fish.  I had ordered what I thought was the crab/shrimp cake appetizer but was brought the meal.  Since I hadn't actually looked at that part of the menu I didn't realize it wasn't the appetizer until I got the bill.  The crab/shrimp cake was adequate but there was too much filler for my taste.  The grilled potatoes and vegetables that came with the crab/shrimp cake were not warm.  Completely over-priced.\n\nThe service was glacially slow.\n\nI will not return.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother solid meal and overall experience at Brio. The decor is amazing. Upscale with a wide open floor plan.\n\nService has always been friendly and timely, although today the hostess seemed a bit put off by us coming in for dinner at 4:45pm and wanting to sit in the dining room rather than the bar area (which she had suggested but we declined).\n\nMy favorite appetizer is the beef carpaccio. A massive plate of delicious raw beef. Excellent. I have had several main dishes in my visits to Brio, and there are a couple standouts. First, is the the lasagna. Second, the carbonara. Not the absolute best I've ever had, but certainly way up there. I have had a couple dishes that were a little off the mark, such as the lobster & shrimp fettucini, but it still found its way into my belly! So how bad could it have been, right?\n\nAnyway, I can't quite give Brio 5 stars, but it definitely hits the mark if you are looking for a semi-upscale restaurant with consistently good food and service.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped here for a late dinner and decided to eat in the bar.  The bartender, Brendan, was great!  Service was fantastic!  He makes the best peach bellini EVER!   During the summer they have a reverse happy hour for the last hour of business.  We had the tomato mozzarella salad, a flatbread on the HH menu, and lamb chops and dessert ... way more than enough to eat, it was served quickly, and everything was great!  The chocolate lava cake is the best dessert they have, and although it came out under-heated the first time, it was corrected right away!  The manager, Vinnie, came by to make sure we were satisfied with everything.  That's customer service!  Always clean and nice decor too.  Love it!\n\n\n\n\n\nLackluster pasta.  Was expecting great service but that  missed as well.  Not sure how they get the rating they have.  Seems like they are living off the greater chain ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Hour King & Scottsdale Quarter Gem! - Here's My Order:\n\nOn my most recent visit, I went for dinner with a close friend and we decided to try new dishes. I ordered the special of the day which was a Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli dish. Best. Ravioli. Ever.\n\nHappy Hour: If I am in the area, this is one of my top choices. I can bring a date for lunch/dinner and get a few drinks without dropping more that $40\n\nGreat ambiance, friendly staff, 10/10.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaprese was excellent. Delicious tomatoes and nicely portioned mozzarella. Had the frittata for brunch and although good, there were so many rich components.  Ask for the Alfredo sauce on the side. Service was okay. The general environment felt a little unorganized and off.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was my very first experience at Brio and I had heard really good things about them.  We were promptly greeted and seated immediately. We did have reservations so I'm sure that helped because on a Saturday evening this place was busy.  Our waitress was great in explaining the specials and anything we had a question about on the menu. Prior to our meal we were served a bread basket which had a nice sized piece of warm sourdough bread and real butter. It was really good. We decided on Peach Bellini's and they were delicious. We also had lobster bisque, which had a bite of lobster in every spoonful. Next the entrees were served.  We had the Brio pasta, Salmon and asparagus with a crab cake, and the lasagna bolognese. All were delicious. We had a temperature problem with the crab cake but it was immediately corrected. An awesome dinner and a beautiful dinner area made for an amazing first time. I will return.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered scallops on risotto because they had advertised it although I never saw the price. Shrimp risotto was $16 so I wasn't too worried. The scallops were burned black on both sides. I kept waiting for it to improve. It was like a charcoal sandwich with tasteless scallops in between.  The risotto tasted like a can of sauce was dumped on it.  I hated it but kept eating because I was so hungry.  I should have said something right away. When I got the check and saw that the scallops were $25, I felt I had been scammed.  I didn't want money back, just an answer. The waiter didn't help.  I will never go back..not happy hour or anything.   Brio chef's cooking stinks and they serve it anyway. Yuck.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me say this\nRoasted Chicken Rissotto !!! So good!\nMy favorite item on the menu!\nThe flatbreads are very good as well. \nThe service can be hit and miss depending on the night. \nElevated Itailian Chain Food.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood place, decent happy hour. Good food. I used to give this place 5 stars but every time i come here (which is monthly) Im always reminded of something that somehow seemed to slipped my mind when writing my earlier review (the most important tips often somehow manage to do that, but thats why they have an 'update review' option, thank you yelp for catering to us frequently distracted folk) and thats the extremely weak drinks. Ok people now the frequency of my drinking consists of maybe 3-4 drinks a week and during/with dinner and i weigh about 100 lbs. personally i wouldn't call myself a heavy drinker and NORMALLY at a restaurant a drink or 2 will do me just fine. Not this place. It takes about 4, yes thats 4, and no I'm not exaggerating. I've sent back drinks numerous times (something i freaking hate and would much rather avoid, but this place leaves me no choice really) and the next drink maybe, maybe might be enough to make a dent. But then obviously when i come back again i have to do the 'send the water and ice drink i just paid $6 back and hopefully they send a real drink out next time dance'. Its just kind of annoying and its how it goes ALMOST every time. note the almost is because more often than not when i come here i pay $6 for water, ice and some sugar juice stuff but in the past (but not anymore :( ) I've had a really good bar tender (he has a mustache you can't miss him!) who actually knew how to make a real drink. But for the past few months i keep getting stuck with some other bar tender. If you don't drink then sorry if you read this whole review. Like i stated earlier the food is great and the atmosphere is nice. Despite there overpriced water/ice/juice drinks (they call them alcoholic beverages on the menu) i still frequent here monthly. Definitely recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you Brio Tuscon Grille for great lunch earlier this week.\nThank you fellow yelpers for your check in and reviews.  When fellow yelpers check in, I do look up and if it is something interesting for me, I book mark. I do enjoy reading reviews online, otherwise I would not have been able to experience so many yummy dishes. This place is no exception, when one of the yelpers checked in, it sounded so interesting, I had to try for myself.\n\nWe arrived here around noon, and it was about 80% full when we got there.\n\nI glanced at the menu and almost decided on salmon when my friend kindly pointed out on today's special menu.   My eyes were glued to the pumpkin ravioli from the moment I saw the today's special menu.\n\nI must tell you, if you haven't tried the pumpkin ravioli, try once. You will not regret it. First of all, it's fall, it's pumpkin season. Second, pumpkin is so good for you with vitamins.  Ravioli is served with many vegetables to make this dish more healthy.  And best of all, this was the best pumpkin ravioli I've ever had. I especially like the sauce used in the ravioli, nicely complemented the pasta dish.\n\nDon't forget to check in on yelp for free appetizer with two orders of entrees. We ordered tomato salad (Caprese salad). I thought they used really good quality of mozzarella cheese, I enjoyed the salad very much.\n\nFor desert, I ordered mini-size tiramisu. It was so moist, I ate this small desert very quickly. I had to go jogging for 60 mins that night to burn all the calories from my desert, but it was so worth it.\n\nCoffee was very good as well. I like when restaurant invest in good coffee, saves me a trip to coffee shop after my meal.\n\nService was very good as well. They were busy but they kept moving very efficiently.\n\nLooks like I found my new favorite place to eat, I will definitely come back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nYears ago I use to really like this place, but now I'm disappointed and amazed that this restaurant stays in business. Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, Brio should be standing right alongside many of the other good corporate owned restaurants in the area, but it falls behind in both food and service. On a quiet Sunday afternoon the place was not busy. I arrived before my friend and sat at a table in the bar area. I waited nearly 10 minutes before the Bar steward came over to greet me and give me water (in hot Phoenix August). My companion arrived but still it took 15 minutes before our waiter even brought over menus. The waiter seemed preoccupied, but eventually we ordered appetizers and a main course.......but still more waiting with nothing but water on the table...finally the waiter came over with some bread saying that he had been waiting for a fresh batch to be ready (well he could have told us that!) But the bread wasn't even warm just dry and unappealing. Our appetizer Brushetta Sampler finally arrived. There was no consistency or freshness about it, pieces of the Brushetta bread must have been cut from a stale loaf because they were really really hard, and the meat on the other pieces was unedible even though the bread on those was much softer. \n\nWe kept waiting for our entree to arrive (45 mins) and it wasnt until after we flagged the waiter down that we found out for some reason he had not put in the order! Forgot to put in the order? Its not like it was a swamped busy Friday night! Finally after nearly fainting from starvation our one entree of Angel Hair pasta with Tomatos and Pesto arrived (we split it). After only a few bites we both realized the pasta was barely cooked! I know what Al Dente is and this was not it. If this was suppose to have a Pesto sauce on it it failed miserably, it was dry,  unflavorful and frankly I was embarrased for the cook.  Seriously? A restaurant of this caliber serving unedible food? Come on were in Scottsdale no less! And the waiter seemed to just disregard that we were there even though there was only one other couple in the bar area.  I was trying to be patient, I was trying to give the place the benefit of the doubt....maybe they only had one cook today, maybe they were short staffed?? I kept looking for a reason to like my experience there.\n\nBy this time we thought OK, lets have dessert and coffee since everything else was unedible and we're still hungry. We ordered the Carmalized Cheesecake with Strawberries. It arrived looking nothing like a normal cheescake slice. Upon sampling it we couldn't figure out if it was a cake or a cheescake.  It had a lone Strawberry on it but no sauce. The flavor or lack thereof was indescribable. We didn't finish it. It was also horrible. How can you offer a tasteless cheescake?\n\nEventually the manager came over realizing that there were problems and he tried to make amends but by this point there was no reason to order anything else, we'd spent over 2 hours in the place with each dish beingreally bad. Luckily, he comped most of the meal but I felt bad for him as well. As a manager he should have been aware of food quality, any problems that might be going on in the kitchen, overseeing staff and checking in with customers as they dine.... regardless, there was no excuse for this terrible food and unprofessional service. I'm normally a generous tipper but this waiter missed the mark completely. it gave me and my friend no reason to even want to return. The only highlight of the meal was the company, the water....and the friendly Valet parking attendant! He got a good tip from me.\n\n\n\n\n\nSame compliments I sent to the restaurant as well:\n\nThis was our first visit to Brio and we were so impressed. Everyone was so friendly and warm and our server, Alicia was fantastic. She described the menu to us with great detail and almost making it hard to decide because everything sounded so good! We were so grateful Alicia told us about the Summer special (Chicken Milanese and Lasagne) helping make it easier to decide since it was such a good value. She was so knowledgable about everything the restaraunt offered, the menu and how the food was prepared. Way more than we could have asked for, but such a pleasant surprise. I don't usually expect spectacular service at restaraunts, but typically decent at least. She blew me away with her service skills. I am so happy about this awesome experience, excellent service and delicious food. I can't wait to tell my friends, post on Yelp and come back to visit! Thank you so much! Worth every penny I spent in your restaurant tonight!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is rare that I have a dish that is unlike anything I have ever had...that makes me think I only wish I lived locally so I could have it again...but that is how I feel about the sweet potato and chicken risotto!.  It was extraordinary.  Fresh asparagus, pancetta, and pine nuts mixed in make it all just delicious- bite after bite.    And we dropped off our kids across the street at Safari Kid Care and all together it was a great vacation evening!!  Kids had fun, we ate well and had a nice short walk across the street to our car.  YUM.\n\n\n\n\n\nHusband and I went here today on a whim. Hungry for any lunch and driving down Scottsdale Rd. we found this place by accident. Never heard of it before and if the menu wasn't appealing, we were going to go to Sol for Mexican food. The menu had Lobster Bisque and we were sold. \n\nThe inside is vast and very open, with high ceilings, enormous \"chandeliers\", and draperies. Everything is burnt yellow and pale orange colors with simple artwork decorating the walls. It was nice, but not my favorite. Looking around, I think we were the only diners under 30 - except for the one baby. Everyone else was either in their 40s or much older. This didn't look like our typical lunch crowd, but we didn't feel out of place.\n\nI ordered the crab and shrimp cakes with roasted vegetables and hubby ordered the soup and salad - lobster bisque and Caesar. A bread basket came out, with half a mini loaf of sourdough and 3 pizza slice sized crackers with miscellaneous spices on top. Sourdough was good - hot and fresh. Hubby liked the crackers, but I didn't try - too messy.\n\nThe food came quickly afterwards. Mine was really good - especially the crab cakes. Only two cakes came on the plate on top of sauce, but there was a heaping vegetable portion. The cakes were soft and moist - the crab and shrimp very apparent throughout and delicious. Hubby's bisque was good, with visable chunks of lobster. Certainly not his favorite, but he said he would eat again. \n\nOverall, the food was good, but it wasn't spectacular. Also, later we found out Brio is a chain restaurant and for the most part, we try to avoid those and eat locally. If in the area again and have a craving for lobster bisque, we'd eat there, but probably won't be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, when I made reservations and asked WHERE in Scottsdale Quarter are you located, the sales staff said they did not know. When we called later that evening, we said we were on the south end of Scottsdale Quarter near such-n-such store, where are you in relation to that, the second clerk did not know. When we finally got there, all three in the front hostess station said they only know they are located in Scottsdale Quarter, Very knowledgeable staff -not. \nSecondly, the atmosphere was like a giant Olive Garden, and the food mediocre at best. My friend and I made a mental note to never return. Doesn't matter because they won't be in business very long, at least in North Scottsdale where there is a ton of competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reviews are all over the map so far for this recent entry into the Kierland-area restaurant scene - and for good reason. It seems that for each pro there exists an equivalent con. \nOn arrival, you will find a choice between extremely inconvenient parking or $6 valet service. Not unusual in this area, but nonetheless irritating.\nI have visited twice now, both times for lunch, mixed results. Generally speaking, the food is constructed of quality ingredients, presented in an appealing way and won't leave you hungry. \nService both in the dining area and the bar was amateurish, as is normal for a chain. Timing was way off.\nOnce seated, we were presented with a bread basket as we ordered drinks. The bread was fresh and warm, and a nice start. Drinks arrived correctly, but I have had better coffee at .... well, everywhere.\nWe placed our orders, each of our party of three finding something on the menu that we were interested in trying.\nAs we waited for our meals, we observed the operations throughout the dining room, as seperations between tables were low. While this made for interesting people-watching, conversation was nearly impossible, with nothing to buffet the cacophony of flatware meeting dishes. \nSalads arrived, and they were fairly large if uninteresting. Entrees followed: pastas were very good, hot, tasty and with no shortage of garlic. Pizza however was a flat, soggy mess. \nDessert tray consisted of a collection of espresso cups filled with a variety of standard offerings. One of the two selected contained a little surprise - a piece of cardboard. I did not order a replacement.\nThey might have garnered another star, but then we got the check. At about $15 per person, not including tip, we were left feeling quite underwhelmed. \nAltogether, I am left with very little reason to return.\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch special was an angel hair pasta was really tasty and the shrimp was very fresh. I had the Eggplant Parmesan which was nice & crusty per the menu description with a very light marinara sauce but the buttered pasta on the side was not hot enough. Disappointing. Service is excellent, we got our food quickly.  We ordered the dessert sampler but they were out of the creme brulee and the server was very gracious and was offering us a good choice of substitution.  We ended up ordering the tiramisu which was very delightful!!!  A definite must try place!\n\n\n\n\n\nbeen here many times and service always good.  Food amazing.  love the ravioli and the medalions.  atmosphere always spot on.  dessert of the warm chocolate cake yummy  we add an extra scoop of ice cream and devour away!!  Love this place\n\n\n\n\n\nService was great, the bruschetta was decent but rest of the food was so incredibly bad. We ordered two main entrees and a kids meal- all were not worth eating. I really hope we don't have to eat here again. Sorry brio!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time eating at Brio.  A girlfriend invited me to lunch, great atmosphere, great menu choices and the food was delicious!!  I tried the Brio salad and added chicken, the spices were perfect and the chicken was a good size portion and very moist!  Our server was terrific, prompt, attentive and nice, her name was Kim!  I will be going back!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo okay.  You know Happy Hour at Brooklyn I'd just very awesome! Now I will tell you that lunch is very excellent also.  We had the steak salad.  I recommend it.  Max and Larry handled 2 demanding women and made them leave with smiling get faces. :) can't wait to return to Brooklyn with husbands to taste the delicious good Thank you!p\n\n\n\n\n\nDecorated to feel like you are in a Tuscan Palace Ballroom.  Swathed in White Curtains attached to the high ceilings, balloon curtains in curved passageways.  \nHot fresh sourdough bread basket & flatbreads - Mmmmm\nSalmon was fabby\nPotatoes done mashed, pomme frite, shoe strings & chipped.\nBrick Chicken grilled to perfection\nYummy Pork Chops fired in wood grille\nExcellent Vokda Pasta purses - smack :-)\nMost extensive childrens menu I've ever seen!\nGreat wine list by the bottle & glass - ck out thier partner vineyard with sketchbook.\nBar Bite menu for $2.95 \nCappuccinos done to perfection\nLoved the atmosphere - I'll be back - YUM!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for happy hour with a  group of professionals.  Found a spot out on the porch and waited for our waiter!  Finally came.  \nRather than waste all of our time on the details.................We will not go back.  The service was terrible!  The food was good and you can't beat the happy hour prices. \nSome of group never received their order and we had to ask (waiter had forgotten to turn it in!!).  No apologies or compensation.  We spent over $100 and had to chase the waiter again to get our bill and pay. \nNot worth the great happy hour prices and treatment we got.  No thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Hour is the only time to go! Obviously my previous statement means this following review applies only to the happy hour menu and service. The food on the menu is $2.95 per item; this is as good as cheap gets! The food is great and the Brio Burger is definitely one of the best. The bruschetta is a another one of my favorites... oh, and the eggplant... and the beef carpaccio... and the--just kidding, they're all pretty freaking good! Unfortunately, they don't really have drinks on the happy hour menu. I usually still get a mojito and it's filled to the brim with ice, leaving very little room for actual alcohol in addition to the fact that they add too much club soda and not enough rum.\n\nThe desserts are not on the happy hour menu, but they are definitely delicious. The available desserts seem to vary according to a random and unknown schedule because there's always an old item from the past visit missing and always something new to try.\n\nThe service is great and the food comes out quite quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly uncrowded for Sunday afternoon.  Big portions, lunch prices for the win!  I wouldn't go for dinner because its overpriced IMO, but avoiding the crowds by going at off times and hitting it up for $14 lunch size pasta is a fair price in a non-chaotic environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place. Food is exquisite and the service impeccable. Right away, as you enter, you notice this place is well lit, clean and crisp. I dislike going into a restaurant and it is dim and dingy.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ate here with a few friends. I had a salmon dish and it tasted great. The service was awesome, we showed up about thirty minutes before closing and the server was patient with us and made us feel right at home. We were the last ones out of the restaurant. I definitely will come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat birthday dinner at the Scottsdale Quarter Brio.  Enjoyed their bruschetta trio appetizer.  Half priced bottles of wine included some great Napa vineyards.  Dinner choices were all very good.  They accommodated our large party with very good service and honored our request for seating by an outlet for a guest with oxygen!\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and we loved it. Food was great and our server was so friendly and energetic despite probably having worked a long shift for Valentine's Day. Food came out promptly. I had the Lamb and my boyfriend had the New York Strip. \n\nThe Lamb was seasoned well with lots of flavor and they were big shanks. I got the Brio potatoes which were very big and had this white sauce drizzled in which our server was a mix of ranch and cheese. Would recommend these. \n\nMy boyfriend got the New York strip which was cooked perfectly however was lacking flavor. It wasn't anything to rave about and could've used even just a bit more salt and pepper. This is the reason Brio doesn't get 5 stars.\n\nDessert was a chocolate lava cake and it was so darn good! Molten chocolate inside and the cake just fell apart and mixed in with the ice cream. Definitely recommend this as a great way to top off your meal. \n\nBrio was not as romantic as I had expected. Don't get me wrong it was a beautiful restaurant, but it was very open and big. I was hoping for something a little more dark lit and intimate, but Brio better represents a nicer Olive Garden. I would say Cheesecake Factory is a better choice for a romantic dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service is crisp and professional.  It is located in the hustling and bustling new Scottsdale quarter, right across the street from the parking deck.  Outdoor patio seating lets you observe and people watch.  This is our absolute favorite place for a fabulous tasty steak salad.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. or shall I say \"Tuscan\". this place has AWESOME happy hour mon-thurs from 3:00-6:30 and 9-10 pm. and the menu is awesome for happy hour the brio burger is a MUST HAVE!.. also the diavlo pasta is excellent as well.!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place. I've eaten here a few times now and there is not one thing that has not been above standard. When ever we are not sure where to go out to dinner this is our go to place. just love it!\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing happy hour! Great drinks at fair prices and their happy hour appetizers are delicious! Regular meals are a little overpriced in my opinion, but still tasty. Definitely would recommend for happy hour deals and for dinner if you don't mind paying $20-40 for simple, basic pasta dishes. Their portions are huge though so at least you get enough to bring home for next day's lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nFabulous Happy Hour until 6pm. Try the Black Pepper Shrimp with romano crusted eggplant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe happy hour is unquestionably the best in the valley of the sun.  the tuscan decor is great with the carpaccio topping the appetizer list for both flavor, size and aioli sauce.  The happy hour wines are valued accordingly.  the main dishes are excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visited Brio at the Scottsdale Quarter for my sister's bachelorette party.  The Staff at Brio were exceptionally accommodating.  They put us in a private room to celebrate the occasion.  Our server Danny was kind, friendly, and on point the whole evening!  And the food was delicious and authentic.  Thank you Brio for making this special occasion so memorable!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrated our 35th wedding anniversary at this restaurant. The place reminded me of Cheesecake Factory, but on a higher level. The dining area is adjacent to the bar so you can see the three TV's. It's not a very romantic restaurant, used Open Table to make reservation and added a note about our celebration.\nWhen we arrived, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes because they were backlogged. When we were seated, the table had two red napkins shaped as a rose. The manager came by and gave each of us a complimentary glass of champagne.\nWhen I logged into Yelp, there was a coupon for a free appetizer which we used for the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant. It was delicious and not that spicy. \nI ordered the Shrimp and Lobster Fettuccine and my wife had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake dinner. The fettuccine was cooked al dente, excellent and the sauce was superb. My wife's crab cake was awesome with the tasty fingerling potatoes.\nTo top the dinner off, they offered us a free dessert to choose from three. We selected the Brio's Famous Cheesecake. That hit the spot. I ordered coffee which came half full.\nThe server needs to pay attention and ask additional questions: Do you take cream with your coffee, (so I can get a full cup) and when I ask for a knife, don't wait 20 minutes and get remind. \nWith our check, we received a note from the manager congratulating us and offered us a free appetizer on our next visit.\nNow this restaurant knows how to entice their patrons...customer service is what it's all about.\n\n\n\n\n\nOlive Garden is better for way less money. The food is nothing special and the pasta is too well done. The bread was good however. The decor is good but I can't eat it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! What an amazing experience! Food was excellent and our bartender Brandon was incredible. Definitely will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nMark our waiter was great! Joe the manager helped me taste white wines because I wanted to get a bottle. \n\nOur whole table enjoyed our meals, cocktails & appetizers. \n\nGreat menu with choices to suit any palette. \n\nTwo draw backs but we wont mention because they made up for them in spades! \n\nThe only negative was hostess who rolled her eyes and was rude when we had to change our reservations. What happened to smile with service.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere last night with friends. We had to wait a little longer to be seated than I would have liked but we were a party of five so I understand. Once we were seated service was quick and pleasant. We shared a couple of the flatbreads to start, so by the time we ordered entrees I was already pretty full and went with a salad, the strawberry balsamic, which was delicious and just made me feel all ready for summer. We were there quite a while talking and enjoying our meal, and the staff never made us feel hurried although it was a pretty busy night. We tipped well enough that I don't feel bad about taking up space for that long, that's something I always make sure to do in that situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent dinner! The service was impeccable right up until we ordered desert and again when we wanted our check. Then it was as if the waiter forgot about us for 15-20 minutes....Other than that one negative, the food was absolutley amazing! Every one of our dinners was delicious. (We all sampled each others) The appetizers and deserts were incredible as well. I would recommend this place to everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here a couple time.  The atmosphere is nice, think Bellagio cafe and that is about what it looks like inside.  Food has always been good and it is a little expensive but not overly.  Perhaps the right level for North Scottsdale.  The only issue i have that every time i have gone i get 'JOHN PIERRE' or whatever his name is.  I'm not sure if he is still there but he looks like his name should be 'MIKE' not John Pierre and he makes me totally crazy.  Doesn't come back enough, drifts off, was very irritating.  After the first time i went I thought for sure he would be fired but i went back months later and he was STILL THERE and i got him AGAIN...\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat happy hour! The service was attentive. The parking was convenient. The food was very good. The rest room was clean! \n\nIt was my first time there and we were happy! Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never been much of a fan of happy hour....Reason being, I like to eat and generally Happy Hour mostly focuses around tiny portions, usually hit or miss, unpredictable or all of the above.\n\nWell, I came out of my shell after being invited my friends to Brio Tuscan Grille for the best time of the day...First, my social life needs a little work so it felt good to be out and to mingle, but I won't lie to you - I went there for the food and I was far from disappointed.\n\nThe Brio Tuscan Grille Happy Hour menu is tiny...just  a couple of items. However, the service is very attentive and swift. I am basing my experience on a wonderful setting, match made in heaven weather, mind blowing prices, and absolutely scrumptious dishes...$ 2.95 really - I've got to call that the smoking deal of the century.\n\nBrio you really wowed me, and not only did my social life get a little polished, but my taste buds also had an orgasm...what a way to kill two birds in one stone...Will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was good not great. Service was good but not great. Restaurant is beautiful but far too open and noisy. All in all adequate but not a memorable experience. Server did her best to make it a good dining experience. If I was to spend my time and money dining out, I would look elsewhere. Great for drinks on the patio though!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere - If the Pope decided to make a bootlegged version of the Cheesecake Factory and build it smack-dab in the middle of the Vatican you would have Brio Tuscan Grill. I know, I know, the Vatican is nowhere near Tuscany, but I think you get my point.  \n\nService - Have you ever disturbed an anthill and watched the whole colony explode with activity? That's how Brio felt tonight. There were servers, bussers and ancillary staff hastily moving about, keeping everything in order.  Like a finely tuned machine, every angle was covered, every crumb quickly swept aside.  Did that teenager just windex my menu? Henry Ford would be proud, for apparently the US restaurant industry has become a quintessential assembly line operation. If the formula if followed, so too will profits. \n\nFood - The food tastes great. Is that any surprise? Among other things, my entree contained the following ingredients... lobster, shrimp, fettucini, mushrooms, asparagus and heavy cream.  I am almost insulted they didn't throw bacon, truffles and a few sticks of butter in there. I love food and I was really hungry, so what I had for dinner at Brio would be the equivalent of giving an alcoholic a bottle of Louis XIII Cognac and asking if they like the taste of it.  Effin A yeah I liked it! What do you expect? There are some foods on this wondrous planet of ours that simply taste incredible regardless of the setting. I should have ordered the roast chicken so I would have a better idea of weather or not this place really knows how to cook. Oh, we also had the fried ravioli appetizer. Stuffed with ricotta resting on top of a very good marinara sauce. Don't even get me started.  \n\nSummary - Either way, what I had was very good, but it's nothing that you can't get from about a dozen other Italian chains out there.  It's like the macaroni grill but with larger portions, nicer bathrooms and a 30% price hike.  Next time I am starving, craving a rich, creamy pasta dish and I happen to be in the neighborhood I'll probably come here again. \n\nAnd lastly, the red wine served at Brio is effective, as I am sure you can tell from the above review.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe it was just us (M and I) that had an very off and weird visit.  They told us that it will be 15 mins for a table.  Then they came back in 5 mins and said a private area is open & will sit us there.  Ok, they sat us on the patio.  Cool.  The heaters were on and I was melting, so we moved to another table.  \n\nWe were enjoying view and noticed the table we moved to was not cleaned yet.  OK, it was not dirty, it just had a used cloth napkin in the corner of the table.  We placed our order and talked.  Then I noticed a feather in M's hair.  I was like where have you been?  I removed it out of her hair.  When the appetizer and salad show up, M was pooped on by a dove.  YIKES!  I heard it was good luck?  She moved to the chair across the table.  When she sat, I noticed a fold white item underneath her chair.  I was like OMG, it is a maxi pad.  Where the heck did that come from?  \n\nHere is the low down on the food and service:\nAppetizer:  Pepperoni & Sausage Pizzetta - YUMMY!!!\nMain course:  Chicken Milanese - Was pretty good, but not GREAT...\nMain course:  Whole Roasted Chicken (M's meal, but I had some) - Flavor was good, but the chicken is DRY!\nDessert:  Chocolate caramel something - It was ok.\nService:  It was ok too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my favorite restaurant. I have always visited the location in Gilbert, but this Scottsdale location is definitely awesome. The surrounding area has tons of shopping and it's a gorgeous area. My personal fav food here is the lobster bisque; I never come here without getting it! The bellinis are also delicious! You won't ever get a Bellini anywhere else. Seriously, I've never had a complaint anytime I've come here.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat happy hour!!!  We tried most of the happy hour items and they were all delicious.  The sangria was outstanding.  Our waiter Danny provided very attentive and professional service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe just had a party in their group dining area. The staff went out of their way to make the food presentation beautiful. We ordered several appetizers, pasta, and a salad. From start to finish the customer service was excellent. Kayla and Matt returned emails and messages immediately during the planning of our event. I arrived almost an hour early to mildly decorate, and the staff was busy setting up tables and food warmers. I can't believe I was worried about the size of the fruit and vegetable platters, they were beyond expectation! The food was ready perfectly on time for our guests and our server Mark (a true professional) managed to keep 30 water glasses always full, and was there for our every need. I would recommend Brio for any event, thank you for making our baby shower so special! (I usually don't write reviews, but this was such a great experience I felt like I needed to!)\n\n\n\n\n\nI've only been here for happy hour, but it's great! 3-6pm and 9-11pm, $2.95 taster menu with 8-10 items on it, drink specials on wednesdays. I've had everything on the taster menu and it's all amazing!!!  A friend and I shared 3 items and were stuffed.  I've had the pasta a la vodka, also amazing.  Definitely worth a visit!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI travel a lot for work. Came across this  restaurant after a 15 mile bike ride in the desert. Food was awesome, wait staff was excellent, I think my waiters name was Michael.\nWill be back on  my next trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas looking for a place to beat the heat and the bartender Brendan was pretty neat! The Black Pepper Shrimp is made for a Pimp. And the Brio Burger! Should I go any further?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was alright. I had the chicken skewers and we got the bruschetta quattro for appetizers. The bruschetta was pretty good. The chicken skewers you practically inhale...i.e. small quantity. So I payed $16.50 for these and there were like three wimpy chicken breasts on sticks with a mediocre amount of wild rice. I don't know, maybe this is to be expected from a place that seems to go more for appeal rather than food quality. It's definitely trying to take its place in Scottsdale as the cooler, classier version of the Cheesecake Factory. It definitely doesn't match up in terms of food, and I won't comment on the service because i've only been here once and maybe I had a sub-par waiter. The management is unorganized, but more on that later.\n\n My dad had two drinks and he loved them. That's about the only sure shot fired by this restaurant. But I mean it's alcohol... It's easy to enjoy alcohol. The generic cheesecake was also good. Again, it's easy to enjoy cheesecake. \n\nOK, onto the management. I understand that this restaurant is fairly new in Scottsdale so it's gonna be busy on the weekends. That doesn't give management an excuse to give out multiple reservations and not be able to give tables when people show up. OK, fifteen minute waits here and there with a reservation on Saturday is fine, but when it becomes a half an hour, you goofed up somewhere. I don't know who to bag on for this - the highschool hostesses, or the manager that trained them to figure out what time to tell callers when a reservation is available. A couple actually walked out after being waited for I don't know how long. The hostesses didn't even bother filling up the lounge. I'm sure if they told half the people that walked through that door that the lounge was free-for-all, first come first serve, same menu, same service, grab whatever table - the lounge would be filled. Instead people were getting tired of waiting, then asking what that table was doing empty. Then the highschool chick goes, \"Oh that's just the lounge, you can sit there if you want. Same menu, same service.\" WELL s#%t, thanks for telling us now. \n\nI hope if you try this place you get good service and the $16.50 plate you order isn't meant to nibble on.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was slow.  Food was mediocre. Ambiance was like Cheesecake Factory\n\nI would pass\n\n\n\n\n\nBacca Limon Martini (as described on their menu)\nBacardi Razz, Il Tramonto Limoncello and fresh muddled raspberries served up and topped with Prosecco. 9.00\n\nBacca Limon Martini (as described by my taste buds) = unforgettable!\n\nSo, yeah, we went for happy hour....and wished we had left more room for a full meal by the menu descriptions of some dinner entrees! However, for happy hour, the portions were plentiful and super tasty. We shared an oversized Brio burger and the margharita flatbread - both yummy, although the flatbread was a bit burnt along the edges. I liked it that way; my girlfriend, not so much....so they happily replaced it with the caprese ravioli. Super yum!\n\nThis was a nice introduction to an upscale chain restaurant that I had been wanting to experience....next time, dinner & possibly cannoli :[]\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat wine list , great food .loved the Pasta. Atmosphere was fun and upbeat. Would love to go back next time I am in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is it that we find ourselves in Scottsdale so often? Ugh. But, when you have an opportunity to partake in some lunch with a bestie.... \n\nWe had heard that Brio was really good, and it did not disappoint. The hostess at the front was nice, sweet, and had a great sense of humor. We were seated promptly, and ordered Arnold Palmers and water for 3 as we waited for our 3rd. The lemonade is fresh squeezed and made in house. Honestly, the AP's were BOMB!\n\nI ordered the Chef's Special pasta, which had bacon (MMMMM BAAACON!) and carmelized onions in it. It was good, but the Lobster Bisque I ordered before my entree showed up was exquisite.\n\nGF ordered a breaded chicken salad, which I had a couple of bites of, and I thought it was great too. \n\nService was top notch, and the price was fair. All together a great experience. \n\nI love the interior decor, as well. It is well lit from above, but not too bright from the sides. The lights are super cool also. \n\nLooking forward to going back for Happy Hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ate here on Saturday, March 10 around 5:30 PM. The coffee was cold, the striped sea bass was undercooked and the manager neither apologized nor did he take anything off the bill. He told us that was the way the chef intended it to be served. We do not eat fish that is still translucent in the center and slimy. \n\nWe sent back the coffee and both entres. They misunderstood my boyfriend and brought him another Sea Bass entre which he felt was average to below-average. He didn't want to wait for another entre to be ordered so he went ahead and ate the meal. \n\nI ordered a new meal - the salmon and it was average to below-average. It was still a bit undercooked for my tastes, but we were now running late so I did not have time to reorder or be fussy. The second cup of coffee was freshly brewed and it was hot.\n\nWe sat outside in the patio area - on the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever sat on in a restaurant. My legs were numb before we were even served. We would have moved inside but the evening was so beautiful we wanted to enjoy the fresh air.  The chairs must have been chosen for their looks because they were cute but obviously no one cared to try them out before purchasing them.\n\nI have to admit that the decor inside is beautiful and the chairs inside are comfortable.\n\nI have spoken to several people who have had very similar experiences at this restaurant. We will not be eating at this restaurant again due to the horrible food and very poor customer service on the manager's part. \n\nWith how long it took to order and reorder everything it put us behind for the events of the evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was great. Our waiter Ted was fantastic. The entire staff went above and beyond and this is the reason why we are regulars. \n\nBrio 4 Life!\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here last week and just had to add my review. The place is gorgeous, the staff was friendly and attentive. I got the Pasta with the Vodka sauce, per reviews on here, and it was PERFECT. I also had the wedge salad which was so delicious. We had the cutest little deserts that came in an espresso cup. My only complaint was I did not like the breads that came before the meal.... and considering my entree wasn't a very big size, it would have been nice to have some really good breads before the meal. \n\nAll in all, i think you should try it out!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for lunch today and it was good! The sour dough bread they give you prior to your meal is phenomenal!  I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara and it was delish! Enough to share, especially if you order it for lunch. The Campanelle Carbonara had chicken, crispy bacon and spinach in it, YUMMY!\n\nThe only thing I would change on my end was the friend who I had lunch with, that's about all. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Hour is the only reason I come to Brio- where you can stuff your face for less than what one drink costs! You have to sit in the bar area to get the happy hour menu. Bar service is always fast, but you will be within earshot of the employees which is always a fun time. They talk a lot of crap about one another or their personal lives, which shocks me every time! I've sat with a couple of friends in the booths in the bar area and occasionally had female servers with bad attitudes, but I suppose I would too if my customers only came in between 3 and 6:30.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place for happy hour! Appetizers are ok!\n\n\n\n\n\nI stopped in for lunch as I was in the area and had some time to kill.  I was pleasantly surprised by the ambience and the food at the Brio.  It is across the street from Kierland Commons in the Scottsdale Quarter, and kind of out of the way if you are at Kierland.  But I was visiting the Apple Store, so it was a convenient stop. \n\nIt is very nice inside and spacious, although not very intimate.  There are several small areas set off from the main room, but the over-all affect is like a large chain restaurant. \n\nI was there right after the lunch rush hour, so the servers were not busy.  There were two that were taking care of my table, and they were very pleasant, and very attentive.  Their suggestions were helpful, especially as to the size of the servings and the daily specials.  I had the bruschetta sampler and the Pasta alla Vodka and both were very good. The prices were reasonable, and that, along with the service and quality of food made it a very enjoyable lunch.\n\nThe servers did tell me about their bar menu and happy hour, which sounds very interesting.  I will have to stop in next time I'm in the area - I'm always looking for good HH.\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided to take my wife out on a week night and it was totally worth it. The service was excellent and our server Viviane made the night wonderful. Her timing on everything was perfect as we never had to ask for anything. We love apps and found the steak bruschetta and margherita flatbread quite tasty. My wife tried the shrimp risotto and lobster tail and I the pesce piccata and they were both delicious!! \"We share\" I would totally recommend going to Brio if you are in the Scottsdale Quarter's area. We will be back for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was excellent, and the service was great.  The place was crowded and reservations are a definite must, at least for a Saturday night.  I loved the decor, on a personal note.  I haven't had Italian food this good since Staten Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent with my family last night for dinner and I was very underwhelmed. The server walked away so quickly after drink orders that I couldn't get in an order for an appetizer. The food was very mediocre, my asparagus had no life. When the food was delivered, all of our meals were given to the wrong person at the table..very odd. Overall, I was not impressed and don't plan on returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Hour with the girls.  Arrived Brio early and the place is empty.   The snowbirds are mostly gone and we have the place to ourselves.  Greeted and seated quickly.  Waited for our 4th person who arrived shortly.  We decided on 3 orders of Pepper shrimp, carpaccio, and potatoes.  The service was slower than usual but not sure why.  The food arrived all at once.  Nice presentation and good eats.  The place got more crowded as the hour got later.  We enjoyed a nice eve out.  Happy hour prices are great and you get a lot of food.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shrimp & egg plant appetizer\nIs excellent.  Smoking deals at happy hour - really good drink prices and food.  Oh yes - the regular food inside the restaurant is very good too.  (Note that I said very good and gave them four stars - they are very good, but not to die for and think you went to Tuscany.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoy did we stumble upon a gem.\nOne of the best all around meals we have had in a while.\nStarted with a great Peach Bellini, then we split a very nice chopped salad. Our waiter, Cody( he was excellent) suggested the Lasagna and he was right on, it was one of the best ever. I ordered the braised short ribs, and again, they were outstanding. Included mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and mushrooms, again they were super.\nIf you are in The Kierland area of Phoenix, this place is a must. \nPrices are very reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was good. Food was good. Drinks were delicious! I'll def. Be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour of us was here for dinner on a Saturday, around 8:30pm, the restaurant was quite busy but didn't wait long to be seated, and the food was pretty decent. \n\nHowever, we had some very bad service from our waitress. First, she forgot one of our lemonade orders, she never even bothered to come to check on us after the food was placed, not even once, which gave us no chance to ask for the missing lemonade; after we had done eating for about 15mins, she still didn't show up, maybe for a dessert menu? No, not at all. We had to ask a passing by waiter to get our check, and of course when the check was delivered, she showed up... We've heard good things about this place, that's why we tried it.. But the bad service just did not prove anything. Although the food was decent, there are just so many more better Italian restaurants in the valley that we could be treated so much better, and better food.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the Happy Hour at Brio's. Great food, drinks and people to meet. The staff is very attentive and want to ensure you enjoy your time there.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarm sourdough bread/butter are served before your meal... Oh my goodness! Chicken picatta is delicious accompanied by a glass of pinot grigio!  Lovely dining venue!\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here last night for a business dinner and was quite impressed. Our table had the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant appetizer as well as the assorted Bruschetta Quattro - YUM!!  We were also treated like royalty, I might add, by the staff. Of course, it probably didn't hurt that one of my new co-workers used to work with the General Manager! LOL\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Citrus Chicken w/Shrimp Scampi and Orzo. Wowwee wow! Tasty - went well with our bottles of White Oak Chardonnay. \n\nI didn't have any dessert (I'm trying to lose 7 lbs), but did try my new director's Creme Brulee and it was HEAVEN in a dish!\n\n\n\n\n\nAte here with esposa and our two daughters.  It was a beautiful Scottsdale afternoon, so we sat outside.  Our server was top-notch from start to finish: witty, personable, and knowledgeable.  Ambiance is nice and comfortable.  Menu offers a nice array of Italian offerings.  Everything was very nicely presented, fresh, hot, and flavorful.  Wine list is a bit limited, but has excellent choices.  OVERALL: VERY GOOD.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing a familiar place made me very happy.  i was able to order what i knew best.  The service and atmosphere was what i expected.  \n\nOnly fault i saw was the bartender failed to explain their specials and had to find them on my own by remembering that i saw signs outside as i was walking in.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood very average.  I have eaten at this restaurant on 5 different occasions and the quality has progressively gotten worse.  He the last two times the red wine was served Luke warm.  I had the server check the temperature and it was 82 degrees.  Tasted like warm water.  He said they do not have a wine cooler for their Reds and keep them in storage upstairs in a room that is obviously not air conditioned.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Hour: Monday through Friday 3-7 pm and then again from 9 pm to close.\n\nThe Details (taken from Internet): While we were surprised that they offer no drink specials, we were delighted by Brio's menu called Tuscan Tasters, which features a variety of hearty appetizers for $2.95 each. The standouts on this menu include the Steak Bruschetta ($2.95), with a balsamic sweetness to it, and the Sausage and Pepperoni Flatbread ($2.95), with its thin crispy crust, was easy to eat and very flavorful. The servers, weaving their way through the crowd of people waiting for tables, were helpful and ever present. They seemed to work as a team, and help each other run food, fill water, and give other general support. Each of them claimed the Brio Burger with homemade chips ($2.95) to be their favorite.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe staff and decor are stuck in 2003 chain restaurant purgatory.  Stiff, unoriginal, and unreasonably stuffy given the level of restaurant Brio is.  The happy hour seemed popular so we tried it.  Kudos to the bartenders that sent perfect cocktails, but the servers tried to play the 'food from a frozen bag\" off as something special and unique.  It's a chain with a good happy hour deal and that's about it.  The dinner menu lists entrees for $25+.  I can't imagine how those would stand up to better restaurants in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went for happy hour and I would for sure go back just for that again! We had the happy hour version of the following: burger, pizza, bruschetta, and ravioli. Each was $3! Only thing better would have been better drinks on happy hour. There wasnt much of a selection of draft beer or cocktails--and the prices werent as good as the food. It was packed when we arrived on a Friday evening. The service was great considering the rush at the bar area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe restaurant was out of the 1/2 grilled chicken entree at 6pm on a Saturday, so I ordered a steak.  The steak was bland and unenjoyable.  My friend ordered the pork chop and it was way over-cooked.  The grilled chicken my wife ordered was smothered in Pesto sauce but still had zero flavor.  This chain has succumbed to the same mistakes made by Macaroni Grill, Outback and Red Lobster--poor food quality driven by prepared foods and a low-skilled kitchen staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! Brio seems to be the 'place' for happy hour at the Scottsdale Quarter.  Packed and having to wait for 15 to 20 minutes for happy hour seems odd.  Happy hour was only available in patio/bar area and we had to wait.  With only 30 minutes to order, we were given a table outside, a very small table.  We ordered a few plates plus I had ordered dinner , a filet with mash potatoes and roasted veggies.  The server was good but seemed overly busy.  Other staff members that came by to serve the appetizers were not very helpful, just in a hurry to drop off the food and rush off.  We had tried to ask for an extra fork and ignored.  My friend received a different wine than ordered and again the server just rushed off.  I received someone else's filet dinner, the filet was basically rare inside.  Our small table was filled with plates since we had to order quickly to receive the happy hour prices.  Happy hour prices were great but I would advise getting there early.\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture is beautiful,  the food is delicious, and the service is always top rate.  Perfect Happy hour location - great prices, quick service, and good appetizers.  So good we usually stay for dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there last night with my family. WORST..I mean worst service ever. Our server was DREW. He literally ruined our night. Not returning!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been to Brio several times (all lunch) and it's a decent spot.  Through architectural trickery, somehow all the restaurants at the Scottsdale Quarter are made to appear very small from the outside yet lo and behold are cavernous upon entry!\n\nI had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (my diet attempt for upcoming Hawaii trip) and it was ok.  Unexciting.  I've also had the flatbreads here and I believe pasta once....but it's just not memorable.\n\nService has always been good, and the lunch specials very reasonable.  The best bread item (seasoned crisps) were stale this time--no bueno.\n\nI can't get excited about Brio, it's food, and faux Tuscan architecture but I can't really knock it.  Oh, and the bathroom really smelled like a bathroom--not cleansers but um...urine.  Seal that travertine folks!\n\n\n\n\n\nRecenly went to brio, and loved it, all expectations were met from service to meals and drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 2 and they're off to a good start!\n\n--warm, firm-crust sourdough bread, my favorite;\n--gorgonzola-topped lamb chops didn't work for me. they just don't go together.\n--crusted lavosh tries too hard, too much rosemary;\n--crab cakes moist and nice texture, needs more crisp;\n--warm garnish (lettuce, spinach) salads perfectly cooked!!\n--lobster bisque has cheese! ew;\n--shrimp diavolo, needed chives not green onions, penne not right choice for pasta, wanted tomatoes, not just sauce;\n--no steaks for lunch, except steak salad. very north-scottsdale\n\n--ratio of staff to guest is at least 4 to 1, and the place was pretty full (lots of manager types watching your every move); they've spent a lot of time prepping for service details and it shows ... and on the 2nd day!\n--exciting restaurant opening, you can feel the energy;\n--chandeliers and wall treatments and \"curly fantasy\" remind me too much of  Cheesecake Factory (just across the street)\n--chef stands at the pass in front of the kitchen, Hell's Kitchen-style. he even has the pencil perched on his ear, and he yells out the orders to the kitchen. all that's missing is the \"YES! CHEF!!\"\n\ncan't wait to go back next week for a steak dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tried Brio tonight for the first time and loved it. The wait was pretty long, so we ended up in the Bar and grabbed a table in the bar when one opened up. The dark wood and decor are nice - we liked the feel. The bread was fresh, warm and delicious. I liked my pasta and butter (for those of you who know me, you know I'm super picky). My husband, who really only ever \"loves\" hot, spicy new mexican food, \"loved\" his dish - Chicken Milanese Pomodoro - I never hear him talk that way about Italian food. The rest of our party was enthusiastic about the food and atmosphere as well. We'll be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I have had excellent food and good service here. Their free flat bread/crackers and their beef carpaccio are amazing. For entrees their chicken limone and their chicken under a brick (marsala) are both excellent. Their whole menu is a delight and I wish I ate more pasta so I could try their carbonara, vodka and salmon dishes. Maybe some day after I run a half marathon...\n\n\n\n\n\nFood fairly basic. Run of the mill Italian.  Came out quick. Our server Cody was very friendly guy.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery nice (read fancy) ambiance, even in the bar area.\n\nMy BFF and I came here for dinner one night. The raviolis were sooo good. My BFF had the chicken pomodoro, but since she's a vegetarian they had no problem subing in eggplant (which she said was delicious). Their raspberry cosmo is really good, and not too strong. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. All in all a great visit. We'll be here again!\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Gave Brio another chance tonight for some drinks and appetizers. I was very pleased. Brendan was working the bar and gave exceptional hospitality! Appetizers and drinks were great! Brendan created a great atmosphere. \n\n\n\nWaited over an out just for our food. Service wasn't great. My pasta came out looking very dry, as if it was sitting out on the counter for awhile. Sent it back as I was not able to eat it. 2 minutes later it came back to the table. Same pasta, just some extra sauce mixed in. Lobster was very mushy. This is the second time I have visited, and I will not return. First time I had a 2\" long bone in my food, and the waitress told me that I \"now have a tooth pick for after my meal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a really good experience here at Brio; the food was warm and good..the dessert was delicious, but the menu isn't anything really special. they are just regular, run of the mill items.\n\nIt's clean, the waiters are nice and it's not very crowded! it's in a pretty cute area that you can spot it from the street. \n\nmy opinion is that the one thing that stands out at Brio is the steak salad and the alcoholic beverages. those are my go-to favorites!\n\n\n\n\n\nChef John and Server Samantha,  treated us like Kings and Queens.  The entrees were scrumptious. \nChef John even created a Scampi dish for our \nyoung diner.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the reviews I've read, I really wish we could have gotten to the food. \n\nAs it is, while we were given water and (yes, tasty) bread initially after giving our orders, we sat at our table for two hours without being served our food. \n\nWe even asked to speak with the manager, but apparently (after thirty minutes of waiting) he was far too busy to discuss matters with a disgruntled customer. \n\nUltimately, two hours, one glass of water and two pieces of bread later, our party walked out.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food ...good value...nice portions...great service....first time customer gets a free appetizer....wow\n\n\n\n\n\nI gotta admit, I've spent several happy hours out on the patio at Brio. Our usual server is a cute young thing and he always remembers our tastes. While I'd like some drink specials for happy hour, you can't complain about a $2.95 appetizer list... and everything tastes pretty good. By everything, I mean we ordered one of everything and went through 4 bottles of wine our first time there. It's also a terrific people watching spot; leave it to Scottsdale to have constant traffic at the valet out front when there's a half-empty parking garage 10 feet away.\n\nRecommendations: the flavor of the shrimp with eggplant was great (I wouldn't call it spicy, though), and the roasted red pepper bruschetta was really tasty as well (despite the fact that I hate peppers).\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here twice since it opened, with good memories of one of their locations in OH from years ago.  Good service, with experienced waitstaff that recover from gaffes easily (such as not knowing their own drink menu during dinner service).  First time I had the shrimp and scallop risotto, which was poorly executed to say the least: rice was still overly al dente, sauce was thin and overall just needed a bit more TLC and it could have been good.  The second time I had the shrimp and lobster pasta, and putting aside the miniscule amount of lobster present (two small chunks for a very large pasta portion) the pasta was fresh made and done well and properly sauced.  For apps I have tried the carpaccio (not dressed with any olive oil or lemon and cooked) and the fried calamari which was passable, but not even to the standard of Cheesecake factory.  Finally, most things have been heavily seasoned.  All in all, I will probably end up giving them one more shot\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Hour visit. Return trip, the prices are half off so you can't beat that. The mini burgers were tasty, the carpacio also very good. I get it with all the stuff on it and its always been amazing. Also had a taste of the shrimp and zucchini (get it unbreaded). The Blueberry Martini also very good, had two (hey its Happy Hour). After all that was actually quite full, The bill was about $20. The atmosphere was good, we sat at the bar so we can talk with the bar staff who are very pleasant. Miss out gal Lara though what used to be there she was always awesome and knew what you wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisited on Monday at noon for lunch. The service was wonderful throughout the meal. They had a low calorie section on the menu. I had the shrimp Mediterranean which had asparagus and lots of other good veggies; and it was delicious. Everything the other three people at my table had was also excellent. \n\nIt was a very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. Very good experience overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nI once went to Brio and we had such a good food. After that first outing I would give them 5 stars. Then I went with friends twice on a different occasion and I was somewhat disappointed with my steak both times. Well done steak does not mean burned steak. Also, it did not have any flavor.  I had to ask for a steak sauce.  Jumbo shrimp was medium size and a little too garlicky for my friend's taste. \nCalamari appetizer was crispy and not chewy so I would give it 4 stars.  Sauces and wild rice - very good.  Bread also nice and fresh.  Pleasant atmosphere outside on a patio and good service.\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG!  Best thing I ever ate!  The beef carpaccio was AMAZING!  I ate the whole thing, by myself!  The staff and service was wonderful!  I will be back for happy hour this week!  I also ordered the sausage/pepperoni flatbread pizza!  Too full to eat, taking home for the teenagers!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened to this place?  Food was just ok. Ordered the Chicken Milanese (their version of Chicken Parmesan), Carbonara, and Grilled Chicken with Peppers for our entrees.  Besides the Carbonara the dishes were very dry.  Milanese was definitely over peppered. We were there on a Sunday and hardly anyone was there.  Service from \"Aaron\" was painful at best.  No interaction at all and he seemed distant throughout the meal.  Didn't offer to take our entree order till after the apps hit the table?  Really?  This used to be one of our favorites but now I wonder if we'll ever go back.\n\nSide Note\nIf someone is dining in your restaurant you should cover the valet charge.  $6 for valet parking in Scottsdale Quarter on a Sunday evening.  Give me a break.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen here before, so this is my second time eating here. The place is nicely decorated roomy and airy, had the shrimp and eggplant and shrimp appetizer, it tasted phenomenal with an incredible brown sauce, a  piece of fried eggplant quartered under a all shrimp, this sauce will make you want to eat a door mat, but the quality of the shrimp, although tasty geared more towards a franchise restaurant not a fine dining establishment. I ordered the fettuccine with shrimp and lobster for my main course. Although again tasty (same small shrimp) and lobster, really? Asked my waitress if they forgot to add lobster to my dish, because I didnot see one piece or taste any half way through my meal. She apologized and proceed to bring me a plate of chopped up lobster chunks which I thanked her for and add to my meal, I finished my meal although good still no taste of lobster, I asked waitress if lobster was frozen and she admitted yes, which I had figured but even with additional lobster I couldn't taste it. The fettuccini tasted home made it was light but they could have made it without the bullshit baby shrimp or the frozen lobster what do you want for $20 bucks. When ordered the meal I had asked my waitress who was attentive and did a great job if there really was lobster and shrimp in the dish, and she said she I should have known you get what you pay for 6 baby shrimp fettuccine and 2oz of frozen lobster\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat meal. I had the shrimp and crab cakes. They were a bit small but quite tasty. If you are very hungry, I would order an appetizer first. The spinach and artichoke dip was very good. A little on the pricey side but well worth it for a nice lunch meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile our server was nice, it's overpriced and the food tastes like it came out of a box or the freezer. Wont being going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was posting another review and came across a rather poor review for Brio.  I have been here about 6 times, but have never ordered a real meal.  We are more of the order 6 appetizers and drink a bottle of wine crowd, so I can really only comment on the service, apps, and wine.  Service has ALWAYS been great.  Never had an issue, or a wrong order, anything like that.  Everyone has always been friendly and competent.  The wine list is very good, and I am a wine snob.  Always served at the correct temperature, and nice selection.  The appetizers have always been really good - we especially like the seared scallops, gorgonzola lamb chops, beef carpaccio, and the lobster bisque soup!  Don't let the mediocre reviews here scare you away from trying it... pick a nice night and sit outside on the patio!!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best happy hours ever! Their margarita dip is amazing!! Also recommend the cheeseburger! Brio also has awesome service! Love it here\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat happy hour and service is exceptional. Real Italian at very good prices.  Nice sitting area in front with valet  or parking garage across the street\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family and I came here last Sunday around 7:30 pm. We were shocked that there was no wait, it was actually pretty empty on a Sunday night.  The host sat us down and we waited and waited and waited... They were fully staffed with an empty restaurant and not 1 person came to check on us not even offer us water.. After about 15 minutes of waiting and numerous waitress and waiters passing by us with NO acknowledgment we got up and walked out... No one asked why, where or what happened. So I can't really rate the food, nor the water since we didn't get any service... This 1 star is for VERY poor customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been wanting to try this place out for a long time and have heard great reviews.  At 130p on a Friday there was a 20 minute wait.  BUT...there was a table in the bar so we opted for that instead.  We sat down and ordered and were very excited about the atmosphere.  We ordered the ravioli for an appetizer, OMG delicious!  Superb!  Amazing!!!  We then moved on to the Italian wedding soup- Yikes- something went wrong.  The orzo looked like rice and was in clumps on the bottom of the bowl.  It was so salty I could not even eat it.  I had to return it.  There didn't seem to be a problem with that and our waitress did take it off the bill.  Oh by the way, I had to ask 3 times for more butter for the lovely flat bread and sourdough they place on the table.  Also, my friend had to ask twice for hot water for her tea.  The service was slow, forgetful, and not so friendly.  So, let's get back to the food.   I had ordered a flatbread which was basically a totinos pizza. yuck!  I had 2 corners and my friend took it home with her to take to work for lunch.  I would rather spend 99 cents for a cheap frozen pizza than eat at this place again.  Maybe a little happy hour with the ravioli- but nothing more...\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere. Amazing food. Great wine and stellar service!!! Will be back soon for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn't matter who they staff in the bar it's always the absolute worst service somehow.  I left after sitting for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. What a shame.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is the worst food ever I ate in my life. my God chicken was raw not cooked the mash potato is cold the a asked them to switch the beans to pasta they forgot oh triable.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if it was the company or what.  After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical, but I wanted to try it, and since my husband was not interested in checking this place out,  I went with two of my favorite girlfriends.  I ordered the Pasta alla Vodka, and I did like it, A LOT.  The soft ricotta purses, were so yummy, specially if you ate it with a morsel of the crispy pancetta.  Our server was very nice, I think his name was Edward.  They were very attentive to our needs. The place is like a better Maggiano's IMHO.  The prices are very reasonable and we had a great time, we were there for two hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow average Italian food and miserable service on the night we were there. I was back on a second occasion with a group and had only a slightly better experience. 2 stars for a nice patio.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I eat here quite often and really like it. The food is great and service is excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply put, I have never had a bad experience coming here. I've come here for happy hour, for dinner, for lunch, and I've even been to their Sunday brunch.\n\nOne Word: Amazing\n\nMy parents actually attended the soft opening and they told me that I HAD to come to Brio. Best advice my parents may have ever given me. I've come here for my last 2 birthday and that's a pretty high honor in my family. \n\nThe best part of Brio is that there is really something for everyone and for every food mood. When I'm feeling pasta I order the Pasta Alla Vodka or the Mushroom Ravioli. When I want to eat healthy I order one of their amazing salads (hint: their balsamic is delicious!!!). When I want meat i get their Mezza Chicken \"under a brick\"\n\nOne of the best things about Brio is their desserts. They offer some large \"full size\" desserts and they offer little dessert shots. There are some desserts that they always have, but they also add new ones from time to time. I appreciate the variety the offer.\n\nEveryone I've taken here has loved it and I will swear by this restaurant\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm giving this restaurant five stars because they went out of their way to make our party of 20 a perfect evening. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious and they took care of 10 adults and 10 kids with no problem. If you have a large group I highly recommend this restaurant. We sat in the north Terrace and we had the room all to ourselves. Thank you all including the general manager who came out and greeted us as well for a great experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried this place after hearing good things from my father, and can honestly say that I am glad he recommended it. I didn't have the full service,I just sat at a table near the bar and ordered some of the great happy hour specials they offered.  I had a mojito,mango with rum and some mint, which was very fresh and well made the bartenders are very professional looking (one even had the old time mustache). The appetizers range from $4-$6, and there are good ones at all three prices. The Margherita flatbread is an amazing tasting tuscan pizza like creation with great ripe tomato slices, and fresh cheese and basil,it was light and enjoyable.  We tried to order the spinach artichoke dip but we were talked out of it by our server who recommended something else (besides the ravioli) so we ordered the shrimp, which came with a great flavored sauce (a bit peppery) and served over a delicious fried eggplant which gives it great texture and another amazing flavor. We also had a small salad that came with a big slice of prosciutto and some greens with a fantastic vinaigrette dressing which I would recommend you try on any of their salads. The overall presentation of the place is great,it's in the Scottsdale Quarter so it's tucked away. Inside its amazing,large shelves encase some fantastic pieces of italian cookware in a rustic manner, and the temple style ceiling that raises to a point in the center of the floor is amazing as well. I would like to try the regular menu,it's quite expensive but I'm sure it's worth it,and the service will make it all worth while for you,I highly recommend you drop by for appetizers at least, they are great priced and well worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time visit.  3 of us had Danny R as a server and he was terrific.  Excellent food and service!  Manager came by to check on us.  A chef brought out our appetizer.  They had is at hello! Lol\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay Brio, I will give you the fact that your Happy Hour 'tasters' menu is quite good. I will even give you your bruschetta (the tasty steak is the best) is fantastic, but your service is seriously in need of some attention. When dining in the dining room, service is your typical average, however every time I have been in the bar for Happy Hour or for a quick bite the service has been some of the weakest in the area. Today we waited for 10 minutes for the bartender (who is the server in the bar) to come over to us to take our order. He hardly said a word and the entire interaction was simply awkward. The interaction did not improve (to my dismay) as time went on. My mom and I had a few giggles over the awkward moments but by the time we finished and had to flag down another server for our check, we were done with the giggles. If you go, try the bruschetta... oh, and avoid a seat in the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio is delish, plain and simple. I have yet to get something that isnt tasty. I live about 15-20 miles from one so I dont get out there too often but I do wish there was one closer to my area.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here last night for the very first time having received two gift cards. Was very happy to receive 1000-points for reserving a table from open table. \nOur server greeted us immediately and was served with a basket of bread. I started off w a glass of prosecco and put in two appetizers for the table: the calamari and the spicy shrimp & eggplant. The calamari was good, nothing special. It came with two dipping sauces: garlic aioli and a marinara sauce. But the spicy shrimp & eggplant was really good!! The eggplant was lightly breaded to a perfect crisp topped off with shrimp. So far, my favorite!! And another perk!! If you check in on Yelp, you get a free appetizer! So was very happy about this. \n\nAs my entree, I got the shrimp Mediterranean which is 5 jumbo grilled shrimp on top of orzo, farro, broccoli, asparagus, tomatoes, spinach, and feta. It's the light menu so it only has 485 calories! Might as well eat light since the appetizers and the Cesar salad I got. My husband got the shrimp and lobster fettuccine. It looked great but when I saw my husband's face I knew something wasn't right. He thought it tasted too fishy and he actually sent it back. (He NEVER sends anything back so I was really taken back). He ended up trading it for the pasta Brio instead which has grilled chicken, seared mushrooms, w roasted red pepper sauce. He said it was better but nothing spectacular... he felt like it needed more sauce. \n\nMy shrimp Mediterranean was good but it didn't blow me away but if you're picking from the light menu, what do you expect? Besides I was full from the bread, appetizers and salad.. my girlfriend got their ravioli special which I wished I had gotten instead. It's buy one, take one home! Very cool! You can have another full meal the very next day. I ended up eating one shrimp and lobster ravioli and it was excellent!! \n\nOverall, the food is good. Definitely recommend the spicy shrimp & eggplant appetizer. And the service was excellent! Took off one star simply due to the fact that the food is good but not spectacular. Will come back and try their happy hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery tasty place! To start, mom had the Sangria rosa and it was light and delish! We simply shared some appetizers for lunch. We chose the lobster bisque, the bruschetta Quattro, and the calamari fritto misto. \n\nThe lobster bisque was wonderful and had diced shrimp on top, great flavor, took the sourdough bread and wiped the bowl clean! The bruschetta Quattro had 3 yummy flavored bruschettas and the seasonal choice, ours was an antipasto bruschetta. Wonderful crunchy bread and flavor! The calamari as always is delicious. It had great flavor with an aioli and typical marinara, but also fried peperoncini!!! Really tasty! Only critique is that the calamari' sauces are not served on the side but on the same plate so they ended up swimming in the sauce on the bottom on the plate...oh well \n\nStill good and we highly recommend it!!! Brio will definitely have us back for more!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat happy hour food. Brio burger is amazing. The shrimptini needs to come back that was one of the best. Entree menu is very good too. Good place for a reasonable price.\n\n\n\n\n\nI happened to get really hungry right at about 3 pm and was near Brio Tuscan Grille. I've wanting to stop by for a while now. The specific time may be why my review may not resemble others. I see everyone complaining of the slow service and long wait times. I walked in and to my surprise there was only 1 other person dinning in. The waitress was very prompt and extremely friendly! So no issues there! When i took a look at the menu i was shocked to see such low prices for what an upscale decor and atmosphere this place had. I eventually settled for a cappuccino and the brio pasta. It ended up only costing me around $20!!! The coffee was rich in taste and the pasta was cooked to perfection! I couldn't have asked for a better late lunch as well as the service that went along with it. I would definitely recommend stopping by here for a meal to anyone who wants some great Italian food! I know i will definitely be returning in the near future!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place reminds me of Vegas-meets-Cheesecake factory decor wise.  It's loud and kind of cheesy on the inside, although peeking out at the patio, it seems nicer out there (and quieter)  It's your run of the mill corporate restaurants.  The food is decent, the portions are enormous!  You can't really go wrong with the pastas here, although my angel hair was about 30 seconds over cooked.  My co worker had the lasagna and she wasn't a fan of it at all plus it looked pretty pathetic and way too cheesy.  They have decent lunch specials, and if you are just grabbing a bite when you are around the SQ it serves it's purpose for an average meal, at average prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had high Hope's here, given the menu selection and the location. We started with the artichoke dip excellent, but it ended there. The Margarita Pizza was bland and mostly tomatoes, the Chicken Limone was lacking lemon flavors, the Chicken Marsela had a very strong Marsela taste a chicken was burned from being grilled not sauteed. The flavors are off on the dishes but easily fixable. This place has a very nice atmosphere and can be a rock star but they need a star running the kitchen. The food portions were huge and the price was very reasonable. Hope they can make it, would like to return and some point and have a better experience. The wait staff was great but waited at an abandoned podium for 10 minutes before we were greeted, eventually we were seated by a server passing by, not the hostess.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food, good staff. Great Happy Hour food and prices. Everything is $2.95.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo glad we picked Brio Tuscan Grille for our Valentines dinner.  Great Location at Scottsdale Quarter.  We had reservations so only waited 10 minutes.  Our server, Chelsea was great! Quick, attentive, but not annoying.  Very knowledgeable about the menu and had great suggestions.  Free appetizer with yelp. We had bruschetta and it was good.  I ordered off the light menu and had pasta pesto and I loved it.  It was light but very flavorful.  My date had the Lasagna and said it was one of the best he ever had.  Then we had to split the chocolate lava cake for desert.  SO Good!  First five star for me, even though it is a chain, they had it all on this night.. Good service, atmosphere, great server, food and price.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad lunch with my boss at this place last week. Very nice on the inside, surprised to find out this place was a chain.\n\nHad the tomato bisque and split the bruschetta sampler. Both plates were excellent. Everything was freshly made (our waiter reiterated this fact several times). My favorite bruschetta had the caramelized onions on it. Also, I loved the mini deserts. Great way to have something sweet without paying/eating too much. I ordered the Bread Pudding and it was AMAZING. I\n\n\n\n\n\nWe hadn't dined here for a few years so decided to try it again.  It is still good.  I had the two plate lunch including the wedge salad and the pepperoni (etc) flatbread. It was good and reasonably priced. My wife had the chicken risotto with a Caesar side and liked it. One friend had the  chicken limone and enjoyed it a lot.  The other friend had the pesto chicken salad and liked it.  The wine list is adequate and reasonably priced. There are interesting drinks: mango iced tea and white peach Arnold Palmer as well as the Arnold Palmer.  All were enjoyed. \nService was fine but there were long delays between drink orders and receipt of drinks and order of food and delivery of food. In addition, when a salad and entree were ordered they were served together rather than as separate courses.  That meant it was necessary to eat the entree before it cooled, then the salad.   I assume that is a bar/kitchen problem or a management decision. \nWe sat on the patio. The chairs were uncomfortable which surprised me. Some places intentionally do this to discourage long term dining.  Not sure about this.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a wonderful evening at Brio with some old family friends. Every one at the table loved their dish, the pasta al la vodka was incredible. Our server, Brooke, was extremely accommodating and warm-hearted. Will return.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my friend decided to try out brio at the quarter on Sunday very disappointed on the service we asked for one thing and the waiter brings something else after two hrs. The  food was nothing special, I will not recommend......\n\n\n\n\n\nJust fabulous food, waiters and bartenders and the atmosphere is outstanding.  Happy Hour is the best I have seen in Arizona.  REALLY FIRST CLASS.  Can't wait to go back.  Their dinners must be fabulous.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name is more marketing than a showcase of authentic Tuscan cuisine but the menu is full of items that are tasty to the American palate. Attentive service, serviceable ambiance,  and a menu that probably has 20 dishes I'd like to try.  They also have a great \"light\" menu for those of us paying 'lip service' to diets.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband (the lucky one of us) won a gift card to this restaurant, so we planned a nice meal here with another couple for double date night.  Normally we wouldn't venture so far from home base, but we weren't disappointed.  It was a lovely experience.  (Did I just use the word \"lovely\"?  Yes...I think I did.  Huh, that was weird.)\n\nWe'd made reservations for a Saturday night and were seated right away.  All the hostesses and servers were super friendly and polite.  The restaurant was very busy, so the open dining area was somewhat loud, making conversation a bit challenging at times, but we'd been there before so knew what to expect.  It has a very open feel.  Certainly not intimate or private, if that's what you're looking for. \n\nWe ordered an appetizer of Spinach Artichoke Dip, served with Parmesan flatbread, which was very good...but the bread seemed more like large pieces of cracker.  I wasn't a huge fan, felt like the dip needed some thicker, fluffier bread to really make the most of it.  But it did all get eaten.  The couple we were with ordered a single glass of wine, mentioning to the server that they would be sharing it, so the server brought out two glasses and poured very generously for each, which was nice.  My friend ordered lobster bisque and said it was delicious, although it was only lukewarm when it arrived, so she very sweetly asked if she could have it heated up a bit.  The server was gracious and accommodating, did not make us feel as though we were putting her out at all.\n\nFor main dishes, I honestly don't recall what the other couple ordered, but they did seem pleased.  I ordered the Ravioli di Bello...yum!!!  My husband ordered the Whole Roasted Chicken and let me tell you, that was a LOT of food.  The plate they brought out for him covered about a quarter of the entire surface area of the table.  For a guy, that's probably alright I guess, but if I'd ordered the whole chicken and they brought that plate out to me, I personally would've wanted to crawl beneath the table from embarrassment.  Anyway, my hubs is a pretty big guy and even he couldn't finish the entire plate, so he ended up boxing some of it for later.\n\nBoth times I've eaten here, I've really enjoyed the food and service.  The prices are to be expected on that side of town, so at least you get a lot of food for what you pay for.  All in all, a great experience.  And don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free Tuscan Taster with beverage!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I had a late lunch today and really enjoyed it. The bread, soup and lasagna were incedible. The service was perfect.  Had a great time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe usually come to Brio for dinner and drinks, and this time we decided to stop in for brunch (and drinks, haha!)... so glad we did!\n\nI ordered Berries & Cream French Toast and he ordered Eggs Oscar... um, well, I ended up eating half of his plate. \n\nThe waiter was so friendly and incredibly patient with me, as I could not make up my mind and was ready to order three or four different items. He recommended his favorite and also whipped up fabulous for-the-morning drinks.\n\nI also have to mention valet service, as this is usually a hit or miss for most restaurants. Brio's valet obviously figured it out because they're fast, friendly and go off of tips... with an ATM machine nearby if you don't have cash.\n\nDefinitely impressed with brunch selection and dinner was always five stars!\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, what a place. Food was outstanding to say the least. But our server, Chase, was who made the night that much better. OUTSTANDING service. I travel a lot so it was a pleasure to come across someone that's top notch in their profession.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I not give this restaurant five stars after trying to dine at their neighbor, Kona Grill and being ignored the whole time? We were seated promptly and our server acknowledged us right away. He got our daughter a high chair and even asked if she wanted juice. Service was excellent! The calamari, peach sangria and the lobster ravioli was excellent. It was a perfect dining experience and definitely what we needed. Thank you, Brio!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have eaten at this location 4 times now and have had an enjoyable experience each time. Yes, it is a chain. It does not try to be, nor claim to be a locally owned & operated restaurant. That being said, it is a very nice chain restaurant with a slightly upscale feel with lovely decor. I always order the Pasta Fra Diavolo with shrimp and have them add mushrooms to it. I like my diavolo sauce extra spicy so I also add some crushed red pepper which gives it a nice kick! It's a great dish so I don't bother ordering anything else. My dining companions have recommended the crab & shrimp cakes & the grilled salmon as well. The bread basket is also delicious, but be careful not to fill up on it! It's tempting, trust me!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there last night with my companion.   We had the calamari appetizer with the aioli dip and tomato-based dip.   It was good but nothing spectacular to make it stand out.  I had the shrimp mediterranean and my companion the pasta brio.   The shrimp had a bit of a spicy kick to it just enough to give it the right flavoring.   It sat on a bed of orzo with an assortment of veggies.   I noticed it had an asterisk next to it, meaning the complete dish is under 700 calories.   That was good since we had just ingested the bread and calamari, and, quite frankly, I was full from that.   I tasted my companion's pasta.   It had chicken and was seasoned with a tomato-based sauce.    I don't normally like tomato-based sauces, but it was a light sauce, meaning it appeared to be mixed with something, and wasn't too much of a tomato taste.  The chicken had kind of a weird texture, almost seemed rolled type, but it didn't taste bad.   Just a weird consistency I couldn't put my finger on.  Our server was Ashley, and she was friendly and efficient.  \n\nI have  been here quite a few times for happy hours in the past.   It is a good spot for HH.    I would give it four stars for that.\n\nI'm not sure I would return for dinner.   Don't know.    I would return for happy hour, though.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwful food, awful service...my husband and I top this as one of our worst dining experiences.  A tv dinner has more flavor than this so called \"Italian\" cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place is cavernous, and not in a good way.  Testosterone fest of male waitstaff.  Ordered the salmon, which came out well done when we asked for medium, and the lobster, which was so salty it was inedible. The waiter was apparently also the backup bartender, so I had to get up and walk to the bar and ask for my wine to be refilled, annoying. Basically he paid no attention to our table at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nAweful!!! Literally tastes no better than my frozen Lean Cuisine lunches....and way over priced. I had the Pesce Picatta. Very bland! I had to add Parmesan, salt, pepper and squeezed a whole lemon on it. Helped a little bit not much. The fish tasted like a frozen fish stick and the pasta was very mushy!!  Italian restaurants should cook al dente. Ridiculous. I would NOT recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was great, the only thing I didn't like was the time it took for my server to refill our drinks\n\n\n\n\n\nI've driven by Brio many of times and never really had any desire to visit this place. My family talked me into it the other night. So it was game on for this place. \n\nWalking into Brio I was a little surprised. It seemed like a more upscale Macaroni Grille. They use butcher paper for their table tops but fancier than MG. They have high ceilings and somewhat reminded me of some of the Las Vegas places with high ceiling and huge lights. Very nice decor. \n\nWe started off with their bread basket of hot sour dough and flat bread. Really good. Down right outstanding. So if this was good I can't wait for our meals so come. \n\nI ordered the Sausage Peperonata Pomodoro. Very nice dish. Nice amount of sausage that had a little kick with tender pasta, cherry tomatoes, and Broccoli. The cream sauce was really good. It was really tasty and I really enjoyed it. \n\nI would say the star of our dinner was my wife's Balsamic Strawberry Chicken Salad. Wow. Outstanding. My wife was raving about it and everyone tried it. Both of my kids said that next time they are going to order this salad. It was the BOMB. I don't remember what was in it but it was booming with flavor. \n\nMy daughter really liked her Chicken Pomodoro Classico with the red sauce. Looked really good and she just gobbled it up. My so ordered the Raviloi Di Bello and it had mushrooms and tomatoes. I tried this and the Raviloi was so fresh with cheese in the middle. It was very good and filling. \n\nWe had a really good meal and everyone enjoyed their dinner. Our server was Dane S. She was really good. She welcomed us very quickly at our table and brought us our water cups. She was always paying attention to us. She did a great job but she was all business. She didn't show no personality but that's okay. \n\nSo let's see. Nice decor, high ceilings which makes the place a little loud (that's okay), very good food, and excellent service. What more can you ask for.  So I enjoyed a great meal and will definitely be back. Enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen about 3 years since I came for lunch.  Tried it again for a business lunch on Friday.  The place was very busy.  Had the salmon lunch entree with angel hair pasta.  The salmon was good, but the pasta was drenched in too much butter sauce.  The meal was decent for the price, but nothing wowed me.\n\n\n\n\n\nA fairly recent family visit to Brio was relaxing for brunch. We were seated quickly as we had a reservation. The prices for brunch were reasonable,  the servings were huge, and the drinks delicious. Our waitress, Brooke, made our visit enjoyable with her knowledge, smile and comfortable ease of conversation, and her recommendations were perfect. The french toast was sweet, as she had said it would be, so we were happy that we had chosen that item to share with an Eggs Benedict dish with an absolutely smooth hollandaise sauce. The others inhaled some of their meal and took the rest home, but I can not remember what they ordered--only that they were good! We did not feel rushed by the staff, and left Brio feeling very content!\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here the other night for my wife's birthday with 10 people total and the general consensus was that the pasta dishes weren't good.  I split my wife's pasta dish, shrimp and pasta and the pasta wasn't cooked correctly and the sauce tasted bad.  Other pasta dishes at the table tasted the same since we shared dishes.\n\nThe service wasn't great either, and we had 2 servers.  The food took forever and one of our friends didn't get her food until well after we did, which is never good.\n\nWe tried this place because it looked good and for the location, but there's plenty of other places I'd try before ever going back here based on the service and quality of food.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here on a Friday night at 6:45...place was pretty quiet.  It's like the Italian version of Cheesecake Factory EXCEPT the food and the service both suck!! Not even busy, yet it took 45 min to get our food. The sever had 4 tables and didn't fill waters or ask for drink refills.  Food quality is more like Olive Garden, but the price point is fine dining...which it is not.  I'll never be back!  Terrible way to start a vacation in Scottsdale.\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner last night was a big family gathering of 15 adults and 3 kids. We made reservations ahead of time (which was done by another family member and apparently was not the easiest reservation for some reason. The initial number kinda had a shocking effect on the restaurant -20 adults initially, not sure why). \nWhen I arrived, most of our family members were already there and had ordered appetizers and drinks. I ordered my main when everyone did so we could all eat at the same time. With too many good sounding options on the menu, it took me a while to decide what to order. Craving seafood and risotto, I decided to order one of the more expensive items on the menu, the shrimp and lobster tail risotto. My brother in law ordered the fillet minion and his wife ordered the shrimp and lobster fettuccini. Other members of the family ordered more dishes, if I saw correctly, one ordered the chicken risotto and one of the kids had an order of Mac & Cheese. There were chicken dishes ordered and pasta dishes and so and so forth. \nThe food came out in a relatively good time, considering the size of our table. My dish was perfectly done. The risotto was creamy but with a slight bite to the rice, exactly the way it should be done. There was a decent amount of shrimp in the dish, maybe even a bit more than I expected. The dish might have been slightly over seasoned but for me, a person who always has to add salt to everything and likes bold flavors, this dish just nailed it. The veggies in the dish worked very well with the risotto, mushrooms, asparagus, roasted red peppers and tomatoes, everything tasted delicious. \nWhile my experience was great yesterday, I had to give the place 4 stars (and maybe could have gone for less if I tasted some of the other dishes). The comments on the table was \"something is missing, this dish isn't impressive\" that was for the shrimp and lobster fettuccini. Our second cousin who ordered the chicken risotto hardly ate any thing from it and refused to pack it and take it with her. The Mac and cheese from the kids menu came in an adult size dish with adult silverware and an adult size drink. This was kinda weird because everything ordered for the kids came out of the kids menu. Not complaining about their generosity but for a kid, this wasn't easy to eat, or drink! The fillet minion seems to have been ok, no complaints. \nOverall, my experience was great & service was excellent. Other members of the family, not too much, some may not even be returning to Brio because of the prices in comparison to the taste of the food. \nI think I would be returning with my husband next time (who couldn't join us yesterday unfortunately) and give some of their other dishes a try. I hope the other dishes will also be as good as the risotto!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I finally made it to Brio across from Kierland last Saturday night. We usually do not stray too far from the Central corridor and RARELY to Scottsdale but this place was worth it. The place is beautiful inside and busy so I recommend a reservation. We ordered a bottle of Malbec (tasty and only $27.00). My husband ordered the lobster bisque...1 word for that ....mmmmm...and I don't think that's even a word. I ordered a chop salad which was more than enough to share....we followed up by splitting the lasagna. This was where it really got good because they split for us which to me is always a plus and kudo's to the person that can eat a whole piece. The pasta was light and fresh and it was covered with 1/2 alfredo and 1/2 red sauce. Maybe not traditional but was REALLY good. I wish I could have had desert but there was just NO room. All of the other food looked really good as well....and...before I forget the service was great. We were served by Saira who knew her stuff....she was friendly, out going with a great personality and helped answer all of our questions plus threw out her favorites. Next time I am going for HH to try that menu because $2.95 appetizers ALWAYS works for me but if there is no seat at the bar than I would be just as happy in the dining room and I would definetly ask for Saira. P.S....this place won't break your wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent with a few friends the other night and had a great time. I thought the crowd was a bit douchey but hey, this is the Scottsdale Quarter. We cramped into seats at the bar with some weird dance music playing which is strange for an Italian restaurant but again, they are catering to the Quarter crowd. I ordered a martini with no olives, confirmed that the bartender heard me say no olives yet somehow had 3 olives taking up room and polluting the taste of my vodka. Not only that but the pour was extremely low, were talking about half way, and I had 4 martinis throughout the course of the evening and they all were half pours which sucks at $10 a pop. A real pour goes right to the brim. I had the Chicken Milanese which was extremely tasty, I would definitely order it again. The red sauce was awesome and the pasta tasted like it was freshly made. Their spin/art dip was very good as well. Everyone at the table fully enjoyed their dishes and the waiter, although seemed new to the game, did a great job. I would go here again and after seeing their happy hour specials will definitely add it to my list. I will try their filet next  time since my buddy swears by them.\n\n\n\n\n\nI enjoy this restaurant it had the best Caesar salad I've ever eaten. The ambience is nice I didn't really like the valet parking it's an $8 charge to park your car in front there is a public garage directly across the driveway from the restaurant but I found it to be full and was forced to use valet parking the food and the service was good actually the service was a little too good she came back every 10 minutes to ask me if I was doing okay but all in all I would say this is a very good restaurant and I would recommend it\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is ok but overpriced certainly. While it is a nice location and the food was ok, definitely not work the $70 tab for a lunch for two people. There are better spots in the Quarter to try for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food excellent service ! Came in for lunch this afternoon with my family to celebrate my sons birthday and had a great time. Our sever Nicole was very friendly and knowledgeable and helped guide us in the right direction on our food choices ,I had the pasta Brio and my son had the strawberry chicken salad both wonderful .Nicole really went the extra mile making sure we were well taking care of our drinks were always full and she had us smiling and laughing the whole time she told us about happy hour special's they offer during the week it sounds amazing. I already have plans to return this week with some co worker .Keep up the great work Brio !Thanks for making our experience memorable.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never dealt with more snobs in my life that I have at this restaurant. My wife and I went here for a couple drinks and appetizers before attending a movie in the same complex.  Our first server, didn't catch his name but he was old enough to be my grandfather, essentially scoffed at us once we told him we didn't want to have dinner but only a couple appetizers and drinks.  After putting in our drink order of some peach iced tea special they had (nothing on the drink menu sounded tasty), he disappeared and sent a younger waiter to help us.  Neither offered an explanation of why the change, but I assume its because Grandpa expected to receive a crappy tip since we weren't there for dinner.  We ordered the Margherita flatbread and ravioli appetizer.  The flatbread was a good concept, but when I think \"flatbread.\" I think flat bread.  This tasted more like a New York style thin crust pizza.  The raviolis were good but tasted like they were frozen and thrown into an oven for a few minutes.\n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves while dining out is having an empty glass.  Between the iced tea and a water that I ordered afterwards, both went empty before a refill was offered.  Additionally, after we finished everything, we sat there, with all plates and glasses stacked at the end of the table signifying that we were done, for about 10 minutes before our server finally appeared for the first time since taking our order (no one came to check to see if everything was okay after food was brought out.)\n\nIn conclusion, I rated this restaurant a \"1\" due to a commercialized food taste as well as receiving a level of service that was amazingly horrible.  This place is the very reason people call the area \"Snobbsdale\" and never in a million years would I recommend this place to my worst enemy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot impressed! With a reservation we still had to wait 15 minutes for the table. Once escorted to the table there was foid spilled and left over from before on the carpet. I guess they don't clean in between customers. Someone had a food fight before we sat. Out of six dishes , three pasta dishes were okay. The other three , one was sent back to the kitchen and the other two were nothing to write home about. In between the appetizers and salad, we had to pile up the dirty dishes in the middle of the table to make room and finally ask the waiter to please take it away. Not impressed and will not go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service. Very tasty food. Get the shrimp and eggplant appetizer. It's very unique and tasty.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the many restaurants located in Scottsdale quarters. Mix of American and Italian food. We went for lunch. The pasta entrees were great. One of the salads came without the dressing but that was taken care of immediately. Checking into yelp does get you a free appetizer. Service is friendly as well \nThis place has an excellent happy hour with several great food items.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had high hopes for this place being good, but, it was not. The decor was the only redeeming quality of the place, but that was pretty much it. The food was not good at all, and probably one of the worst Italian restaurants I have ever been to. I guess one might think I was exaggerating, but that person would be wrong. The flavors are off, the temperatures are wrong, the food just tastes stale or bad overall.\n\nAlso, the place was SO NOISY. The booths are not tall, and there is nothing separating the different sections of the restaurant, which means every voice adds to the collective noise within this place. When you walk in, you immediately have to start yelling to be heard, and you constantly find yourself asking, \"what?\" Honestly, Carrabas has better food and has a better atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been going there for a few years now and we are about done going, today was another poor experience.  They used to be well run but now it's all down hill.  Food and napkins on the floor, poor service and a general lack of care.  Too bad too but it's no longer a well run establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this restaurant!  From the crusty fresh hot bread to the yummy desserts, Brio is the best.  Our waiter, Danny, was phenomenal - great attitude, super customer service, very attentive and professional.  It was the perfect evening to sit outside, sip a cocktail, people watch and enjoy a good meal. Highly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy guy is a big fan of the not-so-chainish-chain, so we went to check out the new location in Scottsdale on opening night.  Thinking it would be busy up til the late hours, we went at 945 and it was empty, leaving us to be that awkward couple left in the restaurant.   The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a great tuscan feel and beautiful draping curtains everywhere; the dining room it a bit odd, however, being just big and open and THERE.\n\nOur server was awesome, ensuring us that we were totally welcome to enjoy and take our sweet time.  Though the wine took forever to get to us, the bruchetta came out quick and was DELICIOUS - get the quattro, thats all I have to say.  Caeser was just ok.  \n\nPat ordered the Chicken Alla Sorrentina, which though he thought was only ok, I thought was fresh, flavorful, and wicked tasty.  I got the Penne Mediterranean - I had asked for extra tomato and onion; the server made a mistake and it had none rather than extra.  I pointed it out, and the server brought it out - stone cold straight from the fridge.  When mixed into the pasta, it was basically pure tasteless 1/2 hot 1/2 cold crap.  I told the server it was no bueno, and he sent the manager over immediately.  Before I could say anything, she opened with \"I heard your dinner was unsuccessful and unsatisfactory - I wanted you to know your entire dinner is on us\" and continued to offer to fix my meal or let me order whatever else I wanted!!!  That kind of customer service is rare and hard to find, and though this is not what I would expect every night at this restaurant (it was opening night after all) I was extremely impressed with the type of restaurant they were trying to establish.  \n\nI will definitely be going back again not just for the customer service, but for the satisfying fair priced well cooked food.  Cheers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne word...\"Bleh\".\n\nI am thinking this is a place where writing a positive review is a condition of employment or something.  However, I do see that many reviews are for \"Happy Hour\".\n\nMy buddies and I took the 129 reviews and a 4 star rating as a guide but were incredibly turned-off.  Really a shame as we didn't have many opportunities to meet-up for dinner on the trip.\n\nDecor like a typical pre-fab faux everything chain restaurant (which I later learned to be true).\n\nService  by a clueless 12 year-old.  Very sweet girl but clearly overwhelmed and not supported by any of the \"managers\" walking around trying to look cool.  No server assistant help either (we had to pile-up plates for them to figure-out it might be a good idea to remove them).\n\nFood was horrible.  Yeah, not overly expensive, but how hard is it to make this kind of basic Northern Italian fare decent...if not great?  The bread is a joke, the noodles I had asked for as a substitute for mashed potatoes (yup) were dried out from sitting in the pass under a light too long, etc.  Really pathetic.\n\nOh well, we should have veered away when we saw it is attached to a shopping mall area.  Our fault (and the reviewers on Yelp sad to say).\n\nSo, veer...veer at all costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBAD SERVICE AND if u want a gathering don't think of this place I will never again \nNot sure where to start I booked this place for my daughter's baptism in there privet room I had 36 people they gave me two servers so can u only imagine the service we got we ask for water it takes 30 minutes and most of the drinks we order we end up not getting and not only that it was my daughter baptism and I wasted so much time and effort to get everything and yet the restaurant had ruined it all so embarrassing in front my group friends and family the food they said we will bring food till everyone is full that is not true my tables were empty and I asked them to bring more food and the server tells me that they will charge me more and they brought food out enough for 32 people and she pouts at two kids I had they were eating small portions with us she like I didn't count them and they through us off for food I looked at her I said how much u think they ate I had smile on my face like r u freaking serious and I told and anyways I have picked one of ur family Styal menu then she's like let me go check and my people start asking for food because they didn't get enough so my husband told just bring us more food she like so will charge u double he we were so shocked but my husband is not that type of person that would say anything but yet he said that's fine so now the manger calls overly husband he was the same one I did all my taking and set everything up with me and him I had even asked him how is ur menu is it like family styal he said yes will be bring food till everyone is full so then when he asks for my husband he talked to him and he tells him I will give u %50 off of the second order of food so my husband didn't say anything because again I was dealing with everything so my husband said okay so I go to see what's going on the manger walks away so I ask my husband and he told me what the Magee told him I was like what he thinks he's doing us a favor I wanna talked to him because this is not what we talked about and the manger never came I asked for him twice and he never came we end up paying for 50 people instead of 36 and the second round food was worth nothing because we only got couple of plates and u know what's so sad not the we end up paying that much but was the service very bad and we waited for the food over 30 minutes it made us very mad and embarrassed with our people for my daughter's baptism I will never ever go there or tell anyone about it I have never put a bad review on a restaurant and we own one but this was just too much not to tell people about I don't wanted it to happen to anyone they really ruined my day\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place for dinner with the family or a group of people. The food was very good. I would definately recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike they say, you can put lipstick on a pig...but its still a pig. The food and the service are NOT what I expect from this beautifully decorated restaurant. I would have been better off at Caraba's. \n\nI've been to Brio about 3 times now. The 3rd (and likely last) time was a recent Sunday for brunch. There were 7 adults and 4 children. Our server seemed disorganized from the time she took our order to the time we had to hunt her down thru a passing server to ASK for the check.  \n\nOur entrees came out in batches. Some at my table were eating 3-4 minutes before my food arrived. I expected all the food to come out at the same time...even if that meant our server had assistance. To top it off, my food was cold. My salad that I ordered for appetizer was over dressed and the lettuce wilted. \n\nWhen a woman in my party asked for water, the server only brought ONE water. She didn't ask anyone else at the table if they'd like water also. When the server brought the single water, she made it a point to say \"we don't automatically serve water\". I know we have a water shortage in AZ, but damn! At least ask! \n\nOnly the kids and the 2 adults who ordered French Toast seemed pleased w/ their food. 2 of the kids probably don't count, as they are 1.5 years old! These growing boys were just happy to be eating! \n\nFantastic food can make bad service bearable. Outstanding service & presentation can make \"OK\" food great. But mediocre service AND food call for a 3 strikes and you're out in my eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTed was an excellent server! We were there Wednesday night. Had the salmon with crab cake topper, diced sweet potatoes & asparagus. It was phenomenal. Please add to your menu! Would come every week for that dish. Birthday dessert trio was very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have eaten many times at their Gilbert location and usually enjoyed the food.  Today was National Lasagna Day according to the restaurant, in the email they sent to me almost daily this week.  Lasagna at half price folks, who could resist? I have not missed this holiday with Brio in the past 4 or 5 years and always enjoyed their take on lasagna.  I remember it being better in the past but it has slipped from a 4 to a 3, still quite tasty, perhaps a bit too salty this time.  There are better choices on the menu but it was Lasagna Day!  The locale itself remains elegant and upscale.  The wait staff friendly and efficient.  We had a doctor's appointment to get to and I told our waiter that we needed to be out in 40 minutes, and we were.  Can't wait for Ravioli Day, better than their lasagna.  As usual, it was quite noisy and difficult to have a conversation.  It is good enough to return to fairly often, see you there perhaps:)\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Food, Great Service! Not one bad thing to say. Two thumbs up all the way around\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a restaurant with prices this high, I would expect a better meal. The food is decent quality, but definitely nothing special. The wait staff is decent, but definitely nothing special. I have only been here for work dinners, but would not necessarily choose to come here on my own.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the food here and most everything is great. I was not a fan of the chopped salad though and won't have it again. It looked like it had started to oxidize and was a little wilted. My friend had the wedge and I tasted the Ceasar dressing which I understand is home made, that Rocked! I also loved the service. Nice guys and attentive without rushing you. I'll be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. The managers and staff are beyond rude. The establishment is disgusting and not up to health codes. The food used to be delicious now I wouldn't feed their meals to my dogs. Brio should be closed down immediately Scottsdale deserves better!!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I have to admit this place ain't cheap. However, the experience was very good.\n\n1. Food was good. I had Lobster bisque and a Lobster and shrimp fettuccine. No complaint.\n\n2. Service was excellent. My uncle's lamb chop was over cooked, they pleasantly replaced it right away and offer a lobster bisque while he waits. Excellent service.\n\n3. Wine price mark up is also reasonable. But you can't bring your own wine.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir calamari was great. I love their pasta alla vodka. It is filled with just the right amount of cheese. The bread always comes out hot and fresh. This place is great for date night!\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped here for lunch on Sunday and we had forgotten how good the food is. My husband and I grabbed a table in the bar and the service was great. I had the grilled salmon and it was one of the best pieces of salmon I've ever had. It was served over a bed of sweet potato hash with a drizzle of balsamic. Wow. He had the chicken Marsala and it was great, too. The grilled veggies that came with it were fresh and delicious. I know their happy hour is good as well.  We'll have to visit more often. Note: they had a yummy brunch menu but we were not in the mood for eggs or breakfast-y items. I did have a glass of peach sangria with my lunch. But no fresh peach piece was served with it...an orange slice and a strawberry. That didn't make sense to me. Hence, four stars, not five.  But don't forget about this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio is outstanding. The GM Matt is top notch if there is a problem which is very few he is on top of it to correct the situation. The servers are all a step ahead of all restaurants in the area. Food is exceptional. Brio is very community orientated. By far my favorite restaurant. The Chefs Jeff, mike and Jorge are very accommodating.  You cant go wrong with Brio They have 3 lunch specials for 8.95. I usually have to have a to go box\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised. They have a $2.95 food menu for happy hour and the options were very good. I had the Margarita flatbread and my companion had the Angus burger. Both tasted great. The burger, although on a $2.95 menu is a full size burger cut into 4 pieces. I also had a mojito which was very good, although this can easily vary by bartender.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad dinner, lunch and brunch here many times. Food is always good, servers are great and there are no surprises. I've also been to parties there and the restaurant is always accommodating in the back room.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio has a fantastic happy hour with everything $2.95 and drinks resonably priced!\nYou can get a hamburger, pasta, pizza, artichoke dip, caprese, etc. \n\nIt is worth going early to find a nice spot in the bar since seating can be limited!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Brio Tuscan Grille in Kierland for a lunch meeting.  It was the perfect atmosphere to do business - prompt service, good food, lots of space, and a moderate pace to the meal.   Plus, upscale food at reasonable prices.  A very diverse menu and lunch specials ranging from $7.95 to around $20\n\nI had the salad and risotto lunch for $11.95.  A huge wedge salad and a solid portion of the sweet potato and chicken risotto.  There was a considerable amount of meat in the risotto (I actually would have preferred less) and the rice was well seasoned with chicken stock, sweet potato, asparagus, and onions. Bread and flatbread were brought to the table before we ordered.\n\nThe service could have been a little more attentive.  The server admitted she was new to the restaurant, but seemed unnecessarily nervous or distracted. I'm sure with a little more training, this will be a 5-star experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been to this Brio a few times and everything is always great!  I am a huge fan of the lasagna.  The different sauces really sets it off!  The service is great too.  Great food + great service = 5 stars!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Brio has often done a very good job with their food, it was slightly disappointing on this visit.  While I enjoyed the Lobster bisque and my wife enjoyed her Brio burger, our 4 year old kid's menu pizza was very much underdone.  The staff service was prompt in addressing the issue. \nThe service was good as usual!\nThe Brio burger had applewood bacon that made it a very good burger and the lobster bisque was nice and hot!a. Our dessert consisted of the mini Tiramsu cups and they were very good!  Even our daughter's taste buds Have evolved to enjoy such a unique flavor\n\n\n\n\n\nBest part of the meal was the Carpaccio!!! \n\nThe steak was okay and the caesar was okay, by okay I mean much better than I'd get at many places, but not the best. The flatbread crackers they serve before the meal are delicious.\n\nI think the service correctly resembles anything I'd expect from fine dining, there's no rush and a lot of room to breathe and relax. Usually there was a server within eyesight and they were eager to help.\n\nThe atmosphere is all that, great for a nice night out or once a year family gathering. \n\nOverall, worth the trip!\n\n\n\n\n\nPasta is okay, but the salad is really good I got a harvest salad the chicken was delish and so was the dressing. Service was great but I'm not a fan of their food the ambience is nice. No super expensive it's moderate. Love the location and the parking so close! Thanks to the yelp event I got $25 off yay! Thanks yelp! I don't know if I'll be back I wasnt wowed or anything. My friend did say the lemon drops were exceptional!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the inside looks like Cheesecake Factory.  The servers were friendly enough.  One of our guests just wanted water and was asked by another server and the manager if she needed anything to drink.  Attentive, but kind of annoying.  \nThe bruschetta I tried was tasty.  The bread was more soft than crusty, which is what I like.  I'm not a fan of bruschetta  that tears up the roof of my mouth, so they got props for that.  The florentine reminded me of spinach dip.  I also tried one with prociutto, figs, and asparagus.  I think they should have cut the asparagus in half to cover the bread rather than run down the center.  It was still good.\nI was brought a chopped salad, but I ordered a Ceasar.  The food runner tried to convince me that I actually ordered the chopped.  This is a pet peeve of mine.  It's ok to make mistakes; just correct them.  Don't try to convince me I've lost my mind and can't remember what I said 15 minutes before.  The food runner seemed to have drank about 13 Red Bulls before his shift; so that may have had something to do with his intensity to force chopped salad on me.\nThey definitely took the name of the restaurant literally when creating their food.  My pork chop tasted like the grill.  It was weird.  It reminded me of when you cook a hot dog on a grill for longer than a minute and it's covered in black.  My pork chop tasted like the grill burns.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus were good.  Nothing to write home about.  \nThey set down food 3 other times to try to serve us that was meant for other tables.  We all said if they did it one more time we'd just take it and ask for a box.  I don't know that I would care to eat it though.\nIf you're looking for a place to dine in the Kierland Corrider, you have many many better options to select.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio is a great option if you're at the Quarter looking for Italian. Plenty of outdoor seating in addition to their large dining room inside. I ordered the pasta alla vodka - ricotta filled pasta with a tomato cream sauce. Either my appetite is gigantic or the portions have been average at the Italian restaurants I've been to in the valley because I licked my plate clean. \n\nEntree prices range from $13-20.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my girlfriend went here for restaurant week and this was a good choice. The deal was good and the food portion wad a lot, we took food home so that's always a good thing. For appetizer we had the tomato bisque and the bruchetta. For the main course we had the lobster and shrimp pasta and rock fish they were both good. For dessert she had the termusu and I had the cheesecake. Food was so good we will come again for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had dinner with my wife Sunday evening at Brio I ordered the New Zealand lamb chops for like 36 bucks I've never in my life had thicker and juicier lien or lamb chops between the three lamb chops there must've been 12 ounces of meat. It was unbelievable because most time when you order lamb chops you wind up with a little medallion of meat the size of a quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food....been here 3 times and never disappointed.\nWaiters/waitresses explained clearly menu options.\n\nWill be back for sure\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned on dinner with the hubby tonight and we sat in a booth in the bar area.  Waitress takes 10 mins to come by.  This should have been my first clue.  We ordered water. We finally are able to order about 20 minutes in.  We ordered an app and 2 entrees. Oh and the app is free cause I used the yelp check in. As we are waiting and starving another 1/2 hour goes by and still no food. Then the power goes out. I see the waitress tend to all the other tables and I'm trying to flag whoever I can in the dark for an update. The hostess walks by on her cell phone and she said that they are still cooking food. Another 10 mins go by and still no food and I see the waitress on her cell phone and tending to the tables outside. Now the tables around us, the waiter places candle so they can see but not our table. I started to get up to talk to the manager and as soon as I got up she ran over. She said that she's been busy with the tables outside. And I said that we are sitting in the dark not knowing what's going on. She said last time this happened it took 3 hrs for power to get back on and that they are not cooking any food now and we could wait. So almost an hour in, we get up, starving and leave.  I know the power outage is not her fault however the extremely poor service is no excuse. So the one star is for the awful service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Lasagna remains one of the best in the valley- the overall  condition of the restaurant and the lack of server professionalism prompts this less than stellar review. A past favorite however, the restaurant needs a serious deep clean! The  floors, chandeliers, silk plants and even the wall areas around the kitchen vents (clearly in view from the dining area) seem neglected and in my opinion unacceptable in a restaurant. It made me feel - what is the food quality?  It was fine by the way!\nOur server, Ashley- needs additional training on service as she constantly walked up to our table and abruptly interrupted our conversation.  \nWith so many options nearby - this location needs attention to stay in the mix !\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my 200th review I am choosing Brio Tuscan Grille.\nFirst let me say that it is a beautiful building , looks just like a Villa in Italy to me. The colors are just what they should be.\nInside is beautifully decorated, and wonderful music is always playing. \nThe restrooms are very clean and nice.\nWe were seated at a corner tablefor 4,it was perfect. The nice thing is the have a waist high wall built around it ,so even though you are on the corner you are not bothered.\nIt is really a relaxing setting. I enjoyed lunch very much.\nI have had their food before,because they have catered a few events I have been lucky enough to go to. Always good!\n\nOur waiter was Demetrius, he was very good,until he got busy,then he was a little frazzled. He gave us the wrong check twice, but things happen and it was the day after Christmas. So it was very busy.\nThe food was wonderful as always. T got the Crab cakes and Italian Wedding soup, delish! I got Chicken with pasta and lobster Bisque. Outstanding!!!\nWe will be back,I wish we could go again this week.\nLots of parking in the great FREE parking garage.\n\nThe more I come over here ,the more I like it!\nOh and do not forget to get your reward card.Every time you come in you get points for dining here. Which adds up to free food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I went here Tuesday night for dinner with a plan to come a bit early, sit at the bar, and enjoy some happy hour cocktails.  Our plan was thwarted when we realized this place was some sort of cougar gathering place.  The bar was packed with little hope of somebody getting up.  So, we just took a seat in the main dining area without a wait.\n\nAnyway, everything to say about this place has already been said on here.  I expected much more because of the location but it really was just an upscale Olive Garden that charges triple.\n\nThe Gorgonzola Lamb Chops appetizer was great and so was the Bistecca Insalata.  I should have just stopped there and let that be my dinner.  Instead, for an entree, I ordered the Garganelli Carbonara which was waaaay too creamy, oversauced and under-flavorful.  It was not advertised like that on the menu.  Almost everything else on the menu sounds good but I doubt the stuff tastes as good as it looks.  My wife had some sort of shrimp dish that looked excellent but was way to salty and no doubt contained frozen shrimp.\n\nThe service was very good but I probably won't be back.  I almost never have pasta so when I do splurge I want it to be delicious and the stuff here is just blah.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've only been to Brio for special occasions. The first was my 21st birthday, the next was the night I got engaged, and the last was for dinner after my husband and I had our civil wedding.\n\nBrio does special occasions like a buncha pros. On my birthday, they made me feel so special, with a free dessert that said \"Happy 21st\" and a coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit. We didn't get engaged until after dinner, so they didn't do anything for that, lol. But it was still a really romantic date (as far as I knew at the time!) Then, for our wedding dinner, it was me and my husband and our parents, and they really went out of our way to make it a celebration. The waiter was so friendly, and we got an entire dessert sampler complimentary. My husband was wearing his dress blues since we came straight from the wedding, and the staff was thanking him for his service, which we thought was cute.\n\nBottom line, I love this restaurant. Eat here!\n\nFoods I love: the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer is to die for, the caesar salad isn't too anchovy-tasting, and the mushroom ravioli is my favorite dish. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were packed on Saturday night, they had saved us a wonderful booth table for our reservation, service was good, food was excellent.  Very lovely experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to Brio for our 4 year anniversary and were very disappointed. It was our first time ever at Brio and we've heard good things so we thought we'd try it. Our server was great, but the food not so much. We don't mind spending extra money on good food but we ended up spending extra money on mediocre, bland food. My boy friend got raviolis which were 16 dollars and came with 5 bite sized raviolis. My pasta was bland and I ended up adding extra pepper to it just so it could have some flavor. We ended up spending over $100 on bad food.  Needless to say, we won't be going to brio ever again.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scottsdale on vacation and the bellman recommended the happy hour here.  He was right!  This is a great happy hour!  $5.00 drink menu and $3.95 appetizer menu and the drinks and appetizers were good.  I got the Capri Salad and hubby got the burger with homemade chips, then we shared the Margharita Flatbread.  It was all quite good.  The flatbread could have had a bit more zip to it, it was a little bland.  Both the burger and the salad were very delicious.  The drinks were good too, although hubby's second glass of white peach sangria was very watered down.  No problem though - we told the waiter and he brought another right away.  The service was a bit slow at times, but since we were in no great rush, it was no bid deal.  Overall, a very pleasant happy hour experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really dislike this place and I'm always surprised to hear I'm in the minority here. It's got a very grand setup with nice looking menu offerings. But I've had so many bland, boring meals with forgetful and unfriendly servers. I was polite and even agreed to come here recently for happy hour on the patio, only to find our favorite part of the late afternoon happy hour food and drink being the cover singer and guitarist who played for us. \n\nBrio is certainly better than Olive Garden, but it has that similar chain restaurant flavor. Underwhelming, especially for the price. \n\nI pray that my in-laws find a new favorite restaurant before our next family get together.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturned for a birthday dinner. Service was yet again horrible. We had to ask for our waiter 3 separate times as he was never anywhere to be found. Food was delicious though. \nAt the end of our meal we gave our waiter a gift card, and $100 cash to pay for the meal. The waiter comes back with the cash gone, and a remaining balance on the gift card. Uhhh what?! He claimed that most people want to pay with cash first than a gift card. I highly doubt it as I'm a GM who works in the industry. \nIf you choose this place, eat at the bar. That's the only employees who seem to have a sense of what hospitality is.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful location. Great for large groups. The staff was so accommodating and attentive. It felt like we had our own personal waitress. We had a large, needy group and the staff did a wonderful job. We started out with the Roasted Tomato & Herb Pesto Bruschetta and Roasted Red Pepper Bruschetta. Soup was lobster bisque and the entree was Pasta Alla Vodka. The pasta was heaven in every bite. Everything the rest of the group had was very delish!\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible service. If you want to be ignored this is the place to go. The one and only \"Hostess\" decided to flirt/chat with servers and forgot about the people in the lobby. \nOur server noticed we had kids and kind enough to get us child menus.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust had the Pork Chops....only got one and it was so good, I requested a second. My cousin had the Veal Milanse and he loved it. Our server Karen was top notch too.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts really noisy in the restaurant. The decor is fake and a bit over the top. The day I came every server was chewing gum...every one. Not just chewing gum, but chomping gum...with reckless abandon. Every time I eat here I feel like I'm in a retirement home restaurant in Las Vegas. The food isn't terrible or anything..its just not that good. Its like Cheesecake Factory. The service is just fair-slow and certainly makes the decor seem even more fake-fancy. Nothing in this review should be misconstrued as a compliment. Missed opportunity for a great location.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorrible service! I have been at the place twice! I asked 4 diffrent people for a side! Eventually had to walk up to the bar! I was very dissapointed both times! I even ask my waiter what was wrong his answer was it is what is! Food is decent tho, but do not expect even decent service\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here for a very late lunch and got a table easily. It's such a gorgeous space with high ceilings and very old Tuscany look and feel. My boyfriend and I ordered a bunch of plates to share: Bruschetta, Flat bread, and crab and artichoke dip. The bruschetta had balsamic vinegar drizzled on top which I did not like. I don like balsamic vinegar and wish it said that on the menu :( The crab and artichoke dip was my favorite dish, mhmmm so creamy and had huge chunks of crab! The flat bread was yummy but I was so full at that point I couldn't have too much. The portions are HUGE and we were so stuffed after, so much for a light lunch. The orange juice however is not fresh squeezed lol I saw them pour it out of a huge generic brand bottle.\n\nP.S. bathrooms are very pretty. I love me a pretty bathroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here two times.  Same server - same (unpleasant) service.  He was training someone else, but himself was incapable, slow, forgetful, unprofessional - just not what you would expect from a restaurant that is trying to be a Scottsdale classy place.  \n\nAmbiance: Nice. Classy.  Enjoyable.  Baby Friendly. \n\nFood: Decent. Smaller proportions.  I like their tomato creamy sauce and bruschetta . \n\nService: Below average.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wife and I had a GC for this place. We visited on a Saturday night about 7:30 and decided to sit at the bar for a drink and soem Apps. There were 2 other couples at the bar and the rest were open seats. I have a beer and the wife a martini. We tried to spark a little conversation with 1 of the bartenders but he was somewhat stand offish. he took our order and delivered the food. The Apps were good but there was lack of conversation/ personality. Now the GC is gone I would prob. not be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had reservations for 5 at 5pm.  Immediately, we were told they were out of many dishes.  So, being VEGAN, and having a limited selection I attempted to order fingerling potatoes (later to find out they were out) so switched to mashed potatoes only to learn they were also out.  Our bill totaled over $135.  We did leave a generous tip, but I am furious and will  most likely not return to your restaurant....oh, yes!  It was a birthday celebration - NOT a Happy Birthday to me.  And oh yes, the waiter talked so fast we could barely understand him.  OMG!  Not highly recommended.  Also, the seating is abysmal ... the warehouse feel is loud and of course, we were seated next to the kitchen!  BAD evening for us.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwhelming, undercooked rigatoni and cold lava cake. Not sure what else to say expected significantly better. 1/2 Star each for the good service and tasty cocktails but the food was just a hair above the Olive Garden, meh.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio has a terrific happy hour that my wife and I always recommend. All the apps are great tasting and reasonably priced. Hard to believe it's a chain. The bartenders (Brendon gets a gold star) are courteous and remember your name. Good selection of reasonably priced wines with a few great bargains on the list. Too many good appetizers to have a favorite but we often order the carpaccio and shrimp and eggplant (we like sauce on the side) and we usually get a Bistecca salad which is really good. We often eat dinner at the bar because the bar staff is so friendly. Our favorite regular menu items are the shrimp risotto and the double cut pork chop. Lastly the management here really cares that you have a good time. Any missteps are usually taken care of without us ever having said a word.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ate here on Feb 19, 2018, part of a larger group.  We had 4 tables of about 9 or fewer at each table with a pre-planned menu, which was small caesar salad, chicken masala with mash potatoes and broccoli and carrots, creme brulee for dessert, and non-alcoholic drink (coffee, soda, cold and hot tea).  \n\nService appeared to all of us at my table, anyhow, as very slow and \"inefficient\".  \n\nFor instance, they bring us coffee, without any creamer.  After waiting for the creamer a long time, I got up and asked for creamer.   Maybe an hour later, they came to refill the coffee cups but the little creamer cups were empty and used from the first coffee pour.   So I went to the server outside the door, and said \"I like it when we are brought coffee refills, but no one noticed the creamers (tiny one-serving ceramic pitchers) are also empty.\"  The waitress got a little defensive and said that I did not give her opportunity to get the creamers together to bring to the table ..... yet.  \n\nWell, OK.  It took a LONG TIME AFTER WE FINISHED OUR DINNER PLATES, before the dessert was brought.  They were not waiting for our dessert choices, the choice was made by the host before we even arrived, what we are being served for the evening.  However they brought us the creme brulee without giving us spoons to eat it.  This time I waited and did not say anything.   But it took a long time waiting for the spoons (not sure if someone at other tables told them we did not have any spoons) to arrive.  \n\nNow I would think that when they serve the desserts and bring them on a tray, that they would have spoons on the same tray, so we can dig right in, and not have look at the creme brulee for 7 min before we have utensils to eat it.  \n\nThe lady had a different and larger salad from the caesar.  I asked her how she got that salad.  She said she told them she does not eat caesar salad, and asked for a \"house salad substitution\", so guess what?   They brought her another caesar salad with same romaine lettuce, but they put the CAESAR dressing ON THE SIDE.   I asked her if it was the same server she asked for substitute salad, as the one who brought her the second salad with the CAESAR dressing on the side.   She said no it wasn't the same person.   I said, \"Oh the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing\", which I found happens at many chain restaurants because it is not the same server who takes the orders, who later brings the food, etc, and the food server does not bring you the tableware (so you get none).   The person who seats you when you first come in, gives you the tableware, so the food server does not \"notice\" that you have no tableware to eat the dish they just brought, cos it wasn't their job to give you tableware.\n\nWe could have all gone home much earlier, but the service was so slow.  And the lady who did not want caesar salad, sitting across from me did not get her chicken masala until the rest of us were almost finished eating, some had already packed their leftovers.  \n\nAs for the chicken masala, I give 3.5 stars.  It is one of the rare chicken breast experiences, where the chicken was not cooked all dry and hard. That is why I never order \"chicken\" when I go out to eat, cos even places like upscale steak houses \"vulcanize\" chicken breast.   Here at Brio's, it was tender, and had a bit of charbroiled lines and flavor but the masala gravy was very very miniscule.   I asked for more gravy, and our male server brought a large urn, which I happily shared with everyone at our table.  I put the gravy on my mashed potatoes, too, so did other people.  It had plenty of mushrooms in it.   Gravy is 4 stars.  \n\nCreme brulee, when it finally came, and the spoon later arrived so we could eat it, I give 4 stars.   It was really good, but not one of the best I've eaten.  \n\nIf I was the host of this group event, I would not book at Brio's again.  Service is the reason for the 2 stars, and \"the service is so bad!\" did not come from my mouth, but was a general consensus, that some of the people at my table, were talking about.   I concur.  I told them that I would be writing this Yelp review.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent place for some great Italian food. Service was top notch and the food was spectacular. It was a great way to top off a great Saturday.", "useful": 0.7065217391304348, "cool": 0.4746376811594203, "funny": 0.39492753623188404, "date": "2015-02-01 02:24:18"}, "19": {"business_id": "-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg", "business_name": "Joyride Taco House", "address": "302 N Gilbert Rd", "attributes": "{'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Alcohol': \"u'full_bar'\", 'NoiseLevel': \"u'average'\", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'BusinessParking': \"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}\", 'Caters': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsAttire': \"u'casual'\", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': \"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}\", 'WiFi': \"u'free'\", 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Ambience': \"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': True, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}\", 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True'}", "categories": "None", "city": "Gilbert", "hours": "{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-23:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-23:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-23:0', 'Friday': '11:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-22:0'}", "postal_code": "85234", "review_count": 1172, "stars": 4.0, "state": "AZ", "review": "I just EASILY had the BEST lunch I've ever eaten!  It was THAT good!\n\nThe chicken tortilla soup was out of this world...light and delicate...fresh and HOT!!!\nI had two fish tacos with no tortilla.  One was a regular fish taco and the other was a beer battered fish taco.l\n\nThe fire roasted salsa was EASILY the best salsa I have ever had, too!\n\nThis place is a serious gem!  I could go there every single day!\n\nThanks guys!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here a few times. Food, drinks & atmosphere are great. Stopped in this evening and service was so-so at best. There were a few dudes behind the bar  (as well as plenty of other staff throughout the restaurant) & it still took a while to get noticed. Once we had menus, ordering a pitcher of beer was painful. After we got the beer, it took nearly 10 minutes for someone to come take our order. Food was delivered promptly - and it was delicious, as always - but no one stopped by to see if we needed/wanted anything else or to ask how things were for quite a while. We ended up ordering a 2nd pitcher & didn't hear a peep from staff until the people around us had left. I did notice that the couples on either side of us at the bar received plenty of attention...lots of chit chat until they paid their tab & were out the door. I guess they could have been regulars, but the treatment we received would make it impossible to bring in any new \"regulars\". \nAnyway, I haven't given up on this place entirely... Hope next time is better with regard to service. XOXO\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food and atmosphere. Server, Bailey, was one of the worst servers I have had while eating out. Never felt welcome from the start, it was our first time at this restaurant. Difficult for our server to even crack a smile, she actually seemed irritated when I asked for a refill on the salsa; barely any in the dish the first time around. Chips that were brought to the table were completely broken. After the first 10 chips, we nibbled on quarter sized corn chips until the meals arrived. Do we want another round of drinks? Hell, no! The check please. So, she takes the basket full of broken chips that we were still nibbling on, while waiting to pay. A sad experience. Friendlier and more courteous service at In N Out Burger, but they don't serve drinks and tacos. \n\nFollowup: The general manager did reach out through Yelp to make it right and take corrective action. I declined contact, my key points are covered above.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there for lunch on Sunday. Sat at the bar and received chips and salsa immediately. The salsa was really good, spicy the way I like it. I ordered 1 chicken taco, 1 carne asada and 1 grilled fish taco. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos. We received tacos, like taco bell fast, I was impressed. All 3 of my tacos tasted good. But as previous reviews mentioned, the carne asada is a little dry not sure why. My friends shrimp tacos looked awesome. I wish I would've ordered one. He said they were good and he would order them again. The staff was really friendly and the restaurant has a great vibe and feel. I love the patios. I will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally tried this place today and was not disappointed! Sunday afternoon, nice weather and they were packed! Ordered a shrimp and a fish taco and they were very good, fresh ingredients and they were just the right size. Salsa is very good, but if you want more spice ask for the habanero version. My only complaint is that they don't have full sized pitchers of beer...small ones at about 2.5 pints each. However, that being said it was happy hour (we were there about 1pm) and they were only $5 so all is forgiven. I like that you can sit outside and the back outside patio has a large grass area so if you bring your kids they can lounge around and not bother anyone as it is not right next to any tables. Will for sure go again!!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I used the \"Add to Waitlist\" feature on their Yelp page and it was awesome! We arrived just in time and got seated immediately! My friend and I each ordered 3 tacos. My friend loved her fish taco that the waitress recommended and I really loved the shrimp tacos! I was a little sad that my taco shells fell apart and they became pretty messy. I would request flour tortillas next time! They have really good tequila and margaritas as well! It is quite loud in there at night so if your looking for an intimate setting, this probably isn't it. But this is a great place to go with a group of friends! Will definitely go again!\n\n\n\n\n\nNice outside area. Service was friendly. Very expensive for what it was. And for all the random things, the food really didn't have much flavor. Not impressed with the \"tree hugger\" menu. We had just moved here and ended up at this place by mistake. (Couldn't find so cal fish tacos). It's a great yuppy hip health food place, but not family friendly looking for REAL tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tried joy ride a few weeks ago during happy hour - the prices were great -  the atmosphere is great - we will be back -\n\n\n\n\n\nFun atmosphere. Yummy thin chips with salsa. Agua frescas con booze por favor. Would go again with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy food was reasonably good and they did a decent job keeping up with our large party - I may just be getting too old for places this dark and loud.  If you are out for, say, girls night out, etc, this may be a better fit for you than it was for me.  I did like the variety of tacos offered and loved their cheese dip, but could not hear the person seated across the table from me, so that was a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried a trio of various tacos. All of them were fantastic. Fresh ingredients. Very tasty! Fun atmosphere. I have to go back for the taco Tuesday and margaritas special. Will definitely eat here again.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here for happy hour with a friend.  Loved the Joyride margarita and pineapple mojito.  We got tacos and those were really good, too.  The bartenders were fantastic and attentive.  Only complaint is get a foot rest around the bar!!  Will definitely be back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the 4-1-1:  The atmosphere is hip, good music, nice wait staff, cool decor. The food is meh. I had the Mexican street corn and crispy fish tacos. The corn comes on the cob with this cheesy butter mixture that is good when you start but way too much a few bites in, can you say water please? The fish tacos were something I can get at any restaurant - good, but not great. We also got the churros con chocolate that were not cooked all the way through, blech. The salsa was VERY good and the chips tasted homemade - think thicker corn tortilla style chips with lots of salt, yum!\n\nSo there it is....I went for lunch BTW so I didn't have the amazing drinks everyone on here raves about, but I don't think I'll be back for food. Maybe some chips and salsa and a marg.\n\n\n\n\n\nCool ambience and good food. There were a couple issues with our order, but the server fixed them. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. I love the fact they have organic milk for the kids meal!!! I recommend the nachos and the braised beef. Choose black beans over pinto (normally I prefer pinto) and the fresh fish wasn't my favorite, fishy flavor.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here on a weekday for lunch with my daughter. She goes her all the time and she thought I would like it. It was amazing. got three Baja fish tacos and a cucumber Mandren orange salad. Also very good. The place was crazy busy and very fun. The place is very edgy in a good way. Definitely will be going back here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis. Place. Rocked. I remember when it first opened and I was excited to try it again last weekend. I was happy to see that they have mainatined standards. I went with my family and we enjoyed apps, margs and entrees. Everything was fantastic; from the food to the service.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive star all the way! Great staff! Very good food! The only thing missing is the beach! Will be back! With the rest of the family. Seems to be a local favorite! I'm sure you'll be able to find something you'll like, and if you don't ask and they probably could accommodate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo disappointed....Been to the location in Phoenix and it was so great, everything from the staff to the food, not here in Gilbert.  Went in late last night about 10:40pm the posted hours are open until 12am so figured we had plenty of time.  We were greeted and sat immediately. While we were given water and had drink order taken at 1045 pm we were told it was last call for the kitchen and to hurry and order. We ordered Guacamole, and each ordered 2 tacos, we also requested pico since the salsa that came with the complimentary chips were too spicy for our taste.  The pico was awful it came out warm and tasted off but since we placed the order we have not seen our server, he was cleaning and getting ready for closing, plus it wasn't busy. The tacos were good but that's really all I can say.  Had I never been before it would be my last, its my last time at this location, I may try Phoenix again but not anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here last night with some friends.  We were seated quickly on a Saturday night.  Got our drinks , and chips. The chips were thick, and not my favorite style, but the salsa was great flavor. We also ordered the Habanaro salsa- it was spicy, but not too bad. My blood orange margarita wasn't very good. Tasted like a mix. I ordered a fish taco, and a salad with walnuts,  goat cheese, yellow beets, and a great cumin vinaigrette.  The salad was wonderful! !I could eat it all day!! The taco was good, but super small, and it had a weird mix of corn and flour tortilla consistency.   The fish had good fresh flavor too. My friends each picked 3 tacos. They were done,  and waiting on me to finish my salad. If you are a big eater, get 6 or 7 tacos, or an entree.  Very expensive too. My margarita, salad and taco was $31 with tip.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is so deliciously hip!\n\nAlthough it's not your typical authentic mexican food restaurant, the creativity of the menu makes up for it.....oh! and the happy hour menu is everything! \n\nThe 'Cheese y Mas'  is a must! very cheesy, topped with chorizo and paired with homemade chips......yummmn!\n\nI also ordered three tacos: chicken tinga, carnitas and pork adobada. Noo regrets! the meat was flavorful and very delicious!\n\nIf you happen to be in the mood for a drink or two, try their 'Prickly Pear Margarita'...super tasty! it compliments anything on the menu.\n\nAs far as service, Tony was amazing. His taste buds were on point, everything he recommended was delicious! He was also very attentive and friendly as well as everyone else who serviced us.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ended up here after the place next door had an hour wait. They sold us on their $5 drinks but ended up staying for lunch. I got the chicken burrito which looked unassuming but was full of flavor and huge. My wife got the kale salad and it was awesome. We will definitely be back !\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there on a Tuesday night with some friends for my husbands birthday dinner. Got there at 6:30 and was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. We got ourselves seated at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender. He walked us through the fresh Agua Frescas drinks and their signature cocktails. I ordered the cucumber lime Agua Fresca with gin and my friend ordered the blood orange marg. Both were knock your socks off good! Little hefty on price, but delicious! Also ordered the Citrus Agua Frescas and a Pineapple mojito....same caliper...delish! Chips and salsa were amazing. Nice hefty chips with just the right amount of salt. Smoky, spicy salsa that wasn't too chunky. We waited for our table for about 30 minutes before the waitress came and grabbed us. She was very apologetic but we told her were fine waiting with drinks and chips! \nNext came the food. Our group ordered the machaca burrito, short ribs tacos, carne asada burrito and a grilled and fried fish taco. Also ordered the mexican street corn. \nStarting with tacos: \nWe were told the best seller was the short rib tacos. I found them to lack any flavor at all and had to add salt and salsa to give them any taste. Same goes for the grilled fish. Very bland. \nBurritos: Carne Asada burrito was ok. Not great.  It was a huge burrito that my husband only ate half of. \nMachaca burrito was good. I didn't try this but was told by my friend that it was really good at the beginning, but then lost it's luster half way through. \nGrilled Street Corn: I consider myself an aficionado on Mexican street corn. When driving through Mesa, I drive slow so that I can look for the carts and will stop and order it. I love, Love LOVE street corn. While they made a great attempt, it wasn't on point. The corn was way over cooked...almost mushy.  Didn't have a great deal of spice, even though there was chili powder on it. The cotija cheese was yummy. \n\nAll in all, this place is great for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers. I will definitely try it again, but will order something else.\nI give the drinks a 5 out of 5\nI give the food a 2 out of 5. \nI give the chips and salsa a 4.5 out of 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nMargaritas are meh, they weren't balanced well.  They were strong.  I was hoping for Spanish rice, they have white rice with lime and cilantro.  Although, my sister and her friend really loved it.  The tacos we enjoyed were the carne asada and crispy fish.  I would definitely have them again.  Our friend lived the Mexican corn.  Chips and salsa were 10 out of 10.  We ended with almond horchata.  Thank you.  I am the loctose intoleranant queen.  Pleasing experience.  Not a wow, but I would recommend.  The energy is uplifting and relaxing.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food, nice atmosphere, great location.  The tacos are good, I had one of each, very unique!  The Beast burrito is my favorite! The ceviche was tasty, but almost too chunky so it was hard to scoop on a chip. No televisions, so that can be good or bad depending on if you want to watch a game while eating.\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably my favorite place in Gilbert. $5 pitchers of awesome beer during the day every day! Their carne asada is ridiculous. I usually get the beast burrito or a carne asada quesadilla, but everything I've ever had was amazing. Great service too!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad dinner here with my bf. We were craving tacos and he found this place through yelp cause we wanted to eat nearby. The weather was nice so we ate outside! I had Carne asada, shrimp, and crispy fish with Spanish rice on the side. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh! So much flavor and I was satisfied with every bite. Their house salsa and chips were good for starters.. My bf had braised beef, shrimp, and crispy fish tacos as well with grilled veggies which he enjoyed very much. All we could say is MMMM! Service was great and they were all friendly. Thanks for the great experience on our first time being here. Definitely will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven coming here for a few years and the food is very delicious. My issue is that all of a sudden, you are getting nickeled and dimed on salsa. They give u a small little bowl to share among my husband and I and if you want another, it's an extra buck on top of the two entrees we order every time we come in. We always get a margarita and ice teas as well. They want to charge extra for taking our ice teas to go too. As customers for a long period of time, who spend good money here, why act so cheap all a sudden. They never done this before. It's just tacky and poor taste to do that in a restaurant. Won't be coming back for some time and if we do, I'll be asking for the manager the next time one of these waitresses tells me, \"it will be an extra dollar for salsa.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service and food. Our visit was on point. They have a nice menu selection and everything we ordered appeared to be prepared fresh. The restaurant also gets five stars for design and ambience. In the area? Just go! Place attached next door they own as well and it's all good!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've had a lot of fish tacos, and the Crispy Fish taco topped the chart.\n\nRecommended: Order 2 crispy fish tacos, one Standard taco, and get your free side order of cucumber orange salad.\n\nAtmosphere: 9/10 (good music, out doors, lights)\nFood: 9/10 (crispy fish and standard taco)\nPrice: 6/10 (little pricey for what you get)\nService: 9/10 (they have text alerts for seating!)\n\nGood stuff, definitely worth going to.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe best quesadilla ever! \n\nGreat fresca's and margaritas too. \n\nSalsa is smoky and spicy. no mild spice here\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to go back to Joyride. We went there when I wasn't feeling the best and I still enjoyed the hell out of my carne asada tacos (what I could get down, I was disappointed I couldn't eat more). The area is ideal if you're out and about in Downtown Gilbert. It is super close to the galleries and other attractions in the area. Watch yourself on the salsas. We asked for the hottest one they had and they charged for it. Granted the menu says that but we had just sat down and hadn't gotten to the menu. It wasn't worth the extra money. A sample first would have been nice.\n\n\n\n\n\nMet a good friend here for lunch today. Really outstanding service! Chips were light & served with a nice tomatillo salsa. I ordered three tacos: the Standard (chicken, guac & a mild aji amarillo), the Crispy Fish (beer-battered fish & slaw), and the Shrimp. So.Good! With three tacos, you get a side, and we both got the Orange-Cucumber salad -- cukes sliced on the diagonal with pepitas. The food enhanced the company, which is always nice. And the restaurant provided a great vantage point to watch a very fast dust storm move in! Will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride Taco House includes all of the wonderfully trendy requisites that those familiar with Upward Projects concepts are accustomed to: contemporary interior, big-indie playlist, hipstaff with an accommodating if occasionally tepid disposition,  and cheery bathroom displays of branded toilet paper.  It's owners' predecessors are much more subdued and earthy in character; Joyride is borderline frenetic by comparison, and I mean that in a good way: it's all bright colors and motley decor and 'we're blasting our decent taste in music on purpose you damn suburbanites so don't bring the babes if you're going to be uptight about it.'\n\nAfter scoping the decidedly mixed taco reviews (we Phoenicians are a notoriously cheap lot, aren't we?) I opted for the Cosmic Torta (veggie sandwich).  Too many mealy textures more appropriate in a burrito (squash beans salsa etc.) made for a mouth-feel that was muddy as hell, (which I really should have anticipated, by the way.)  The bread was perfectly tender and the presence of avocado improves pretty much anything, but overall big thumbs meh: that bite needs reworking.  The cocktails were the type of cloyingly saccharine deliciousness that you can't stop from ordering even though you know they're going to roil ceaselessly in your stomach later on.  I had a Mazatlan Mule and two Blood Orange Margaritas - so much delightfully tooth-aching tastiness going on, enough to +1 in terms of stars.\n\nNot the best of the UP lot.  That said, still better than 95% of the restaurants in the god awful locale that is Gilbert.  A must try if you're within a ten mile radius.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the Ensalada Fila.  It was a delicious salad, and I know my salads!  The others in my party loved their food as well.  Delicious!  I live far away but will come again when I next visit.  It is a fun place with great food and friendly service.  It has a loud atmosphere so not the place for a quiet dinner, but fun and even kid friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's gets high marks for its trendy atmosphere and inventive taco combinations, but I prefer more traditional Mexican street tacos.  This is a fantastic place to go on a date, but there are certainly better taquerias if you simply want great food.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride has the absolute best mini tacos. Their corn - out of this world. I love eating here! The staff is always excellent and quick- even on busy Friday nights!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first time, sadly last time. Nothing special here and we came on staff doesn't care day\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is FANTASTIC. Fantastic food, fantastic drinks, fantastic atmosphere... And most importantly a great great staff. This was our first time here and, even though it was crazy busy, they wanted to make sure we understood the menu and all the things that were so good. Big big kudos to Shelby who took care of us beyond what we were expecting. Warily do I go to a restaurant and ask for a specific server, but I will in this case in the future.  Will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI absolutely love this place! Their carne asada tacos with avocado were super delicious! The wait staff was attentive and helpful. But really, the best part... they played 90s music the entire time I was there and I seriously didn't want to leave!\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have a great lunch special- 2 tacos & either a generous portion of soup or salad. The crispy fish and the shrimp tacos are very yummy!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been to this place several times now and I have had a good experience every time so far. The service is good and the tacos are tasty.\n\nTo anyone who doesn't eat meat - the vegetarian taco is so flavorful and delicious!!!! Order a couple of these and a beverage ;)\n\nI love how they fresh squeeze all their juices and the happy hour is a great deal. I recommend the fresco drink with fresh pineapple juice and tequila.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the tacos!  Can be noisy inside during busy times.  I prefer to eat on their spacious patio in the cooler months. Still one of my favorites places.\n\n\n\n\n\nI cant believe i am saying this but I will never go here again.  I had such high hopes for this place with postinos being my wife and I's favorite restaurant but man they did not get it right here.  For those of you that are thinking about going here I want to list out some pros and cons so that you don't make the same mistake I did.  \n\nPros \nThere is a great hipster trendy atmosphere and they do the same type of happy hour as postinos so if you are there before 5 the drink prices are pretty good.  Similar to postinos they do the candle light at night which some I always think had a great ambiance.  I think this is preference though as I did see in another post that the lighting was poor.\n\nCons\nService was incredibly slow it took us two and a half hours from being seated to paying the bill.  There was several times we even had to get up and go find someone to place orders or get the bill.  The tacos were small street style tacos and decent but not big enough to be 4 dollars a taco.  The enchiladas were also not very good at all.  The mixed drinks were 9 dollars a drink which is about on par for most places but they hardly gave you anything in them.  They served them in rocks glass (small to begin with) an had them filled to the top with ice.  We actually finished our entire drink before it melted and then when the ice melted it filled the cup up with 2/3 water.  \n\nI am glad to see more stuff going into downtown Gilbert and I hope these issues get fixed so that maybe at some point I will end up liking them as much as I do there sister restaurant postinos but for now I don't intend to go back any time soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: I NEVER come to this part of Gilbert (don't live close by), but there's a cute few blocks of restaurants & I'd definitely venture out here again to try some other places. End aside...\n\nI met a friend here for HH and really like it! It was on a Tuesday which meant \"Taco Tuesday (all tacos are $2 each).\" I had a crispy fish taco, that was good. The breading was crispy & the slaw that was on it was crisp as well. I also had a carne asada taco. The meat was a little dry, but it was still very good. We also had chips & salsa, and honestly all of this would have been a good meal. The tacos are pretty decently sized. \n\nHowever, since it was HH I ordered a quesadilla as well (intending to split it) and it was HUGE. It was thick, full of a ton of cheese, and was yummy. During HH Joyride does certain apps for $4 (the quesadilla was one of these) & $6. I saw a lot of people were ordering nachos & the platter they were served looked HUGE! \n\nI ordered a couple margs as well. I started w/a prickly pear even though I generally don't like flavored margaritas. Honestly, it was a bit sweet but still good. I also got a regular marg. It didn't stand out it in any way, but it was still good. \n\nThe service at Joyride was good, as well. I'll come back!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is awesome!! The food is outstanding! Everything my wife and I had was wonderful and full of flavor. The beast burrito is a true \"beast\" so bring your appetite for that one. Drinks are new and very good. Let them help you pick a good one. The atmosphere was great and they play some really good tunes. Of course you have to like old hair bands to dig the tunes. We will be back to this place again and again.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 stars\n\nA group of 4 - about $75 \nOn our table: \nMexican street corn\nVegetarian tacos\nCrispy fish taco\nCarne asada taco\nCarnitas taco\nNachos\nBeast burrito \n\nDrinks: \nAlmond horchata\nRosemary mint tea\nIced tea\nCoke\n\nThe atmosphere: The atmospheric here is cool. It had outdoor seating and indoor seating, tables and chairs and some booths with pops of color here and there. The seats are adorable. The only odd thing was that I sat back to open water pitchers and if I had left my hair down I may have been able to get in another bath for the day. They have outdoor seating and on a less windy day I would have enjoyed our meal outside but I like my food hot when it's suppose to be hot. \n\nThe service: I don't know who our server was. A younger guy came and took our drink order and another brought out our drinks and then a young lady came and took our order and the younger guy came to take our order again then someone else brought our food. We had water refilled but not offered to refill our soda.. They did continually bus our table as we finished plates though.   I think the only highlight of the service was the last guy came to talk us into desserts and named every ingredient for each dessert like his life depended on it but couldn't sell us on it but did sound good. So right here is where a part of my 3.5 star review came into play. Honestly if there was a good flow here I think lunch would have been better but in their defense they were absolutely nice. Just not attentive and no communication between each other.  \n\nThe food: \nMexican street corn was probably the only thing I'd come back for. \n\nMy hubs did enjoy his beast burrito. \n\nThe tacos were really the only thing we had come here for in the first place but they didn't hit the mark. Maybe I'm not used to cold food, maybe the the corn tortillas is supposed to be that thick? Is this typical & I just don't know good tacos when I see them? I've eaten a lot of tacos in my life (it shows) and these were ok but not wow. The crispy fish taco I think could have been really good but was a tad too salty but at least it wasn't greasy and rubbery. \n\nThe nachos lacked cheese. I think good nachos should have good coverage, layered for every chip to hang out with some cheese, a protein and pico. A good nacho can then have a cohesive marriage. These nachos were in a long distance relationship.\n\nWhat I like is going places that have a vegetarian menu. This place offers such but the offerings  taste-wise were just okay.\n\nThe horchata - technically our only specialty drink. It was ok - not overly sweet but idk if it was too nutty with the almonds for my taste. It almost had a nutmeg flavor in it and maybe I'm just used to a more cinnamon-y rice drink. \n\nSo overall it was ok all around. Not overly disappointed when we left but not excited for another visit here. \n\nWould I recommend? There's potential. The location is great. The people are nice. The food could be better and customer service could be better. -----but no I probably wouldn't recommend or bring my friends here if they were craving Mexican fare.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is a bad restaurant to go to because the music is far too loud. Also their margaritas are of very low quality, using only the cheapest possible ingredients. I don't know why they need a bartender because they serve what could be a store bought margarita mix. The cost of two margaritas and a diet pepsi was $22. Also, Joyride as no blender, so all they make is margaritas on the rocks. Why they would not have a blender is totally illogical. The waiter actually said, \"it we would be great if we had a blender.\" Joyride is the type of restaurant that you have a hard time believing is still in business. \n\nWe were not able to stay to actually eat anything becuase the restaurant itself was so unpleasant to stay in. But the restaurant is clearly focused on style over substance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright so I'm going to start off with the negative part of the review. The customer service was absolutely terrible. Worst I've ever seen. I got to the restaurant and there was an open, clean table, waiting for someone to sit at, and they made us wait 15 minutes to sit there. We order our food, not one waiter/waitress introduced them self or offered to help. They didn't replace the chips or salsa and the wait was very long. None of them asked if we needed a refill of anything, and when the bill came out , it was not separate like we requested, but all as one. When we left the lady at the front did not say anything to us, did not say \"thanks for coming in\" or \"have a nice day.\" She was on her phone tweeting about her day. It was ridiculous. The food was pretty good but it was a little over priced. $12 for my burrito. But i smacked all of It. Maybe will attend again, if they hire new employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: I'm not going to do an entire review, as I previously reviewed Joyride. Instead, I'm going to update it and review what I think is the more typical experience here. The last visit I had, we waited for way too long to get our receipt, and it really soured an otherwise pleasant visit. This time, the service was very attentive, and we all had a great time. The tacos were all quite tasty, just like the last time. The chicken burrito was excellent. The guacamole is tasty--with chunks, just like I like it.\n\nThe one item that I tried this time that was entirely new was the orange cucumber salad side. It was absolutely fantastic! It had a nice fresh taste to it, and it went great with the other flavors in the meal. Good stuff.\n\nI'm glad that I gave this place another try.\n\nOld review: Pretty tasty food, fun environment, really odd experience overall.\n\nSo this was my first trip to Joyride Taco House, and it was a rather odd experience, service-wise. I'll get to that after mentioning the food first.\n\nThe setting is pretty fun. It's right in the middle of Gilbert's \"main street\". The big side doors open for a nice open, airy experience. When the weather is nice, it's a perfect setting.\n\nThe chips and salsa came out first. These chips are better than most out there--a little thick, with some good flavor. And the salsa, though not particularly spicy, is really good stuff. My date told me that the guacamole is excellent--I'll have to try it another time.\n\nWe shared the chicken burrito and a couple of tacos--the pork adovada and the chicken. The burrito was excellent! There are a ton of items in that burrito, and the combination of all of them was really good. The sauce provided added some nice extra flavor as well. I must say that quantity-wise, this is a pretty small burrito. If I ordered this as my full meal, I'd probably have been a bit disappointed. Fortunately, I had 2 other tacos. The tacos were decent. The pork was disappointingly bland, though. I'm not sure what happened with it, but it just didn't do it for me. The chicken was really solid. I'll come back to try some of the other tacos.\n\nSo the odd part of the experience. We sat at the table for over 3 hours, and not a single person ever asked us if we wanted our check. Now, this normally would be grounds for a really low rating in my book, but I am considering the situation in its entirety. We were having a lot of fun talking, and that was likely apparent to others. Maybe they were just respecting our having a conversation. But still, not a single person asked us if we wanted our check, and at some point, they seemed to completely forget about us. We'd have left earlier if somebody had come and asked us, but because nobody did and we weren't in a rush, we just kept talking. When we finally had to leave, I walked up to the bar, because we couldn't find our server. A manager saw me and asked me if I wanted the check. So we got it and finally left.\n\nGood food, good setting. And I'll give the service another chance in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen here a number of times, decided that I've gone enough to write a review. \n\nPutting it in bullet points to make it easier to read: \n\nPROS:\n- Cool looking spot to hang out with friends (Not completely friendly to large groups).\n- Outdoor seating area is nice on a warm night. \n- When waiting for seating to open up, they have a texting service so you can wander about (but don't wander too far!).\n- Drink TASTE is decent. \n- They give you chips and salsa when you're waiting (They do charge $1 for refills).\n\n\nCONS:\n- Drink prices are on the higher side. \n- Food prices are a little ridiculous as well (I guess you're 'paying' for the atmosphere as well).\n- While staff are friendly, but guest service is pretty horrendous. \n- Food takes WAY too long to get out to you, so forget coming here with a large group of people (as mentioned earlier).\n- The food isn't the most exciting in terms of taste. \n\nOverall  the price you see on the check I believe is too high for the quality of service and quality of food/drink you receive. If the service greatly improved, I wouldn't have a problem with how much the bill comes out to. \n\nGo at your own risk! Hopefully, you have a better time than myself.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot impressed. \n\nI realize its a holiday but maybe management could have planned better.. The wait wasn't ridiculous it just seemed like chaos everywhere, free for all if you will..\n\nThe location and concept are on point though a little over ambitious, it seemed like everything on the menu had one or two too many ingredients making it just a little over complicated.\n\nThe reason for two stars is the poor execution of a great idea.. EVERYTHING (nearly, pinto beans were piping) was Cold, eck!! Side of chicken, roasted veggies and tacos all intended to be eaten warm were luke warm at best.  It lends concern to the \"danger zone\" theory. And why so hot on the beans but so temped on everything else? Microwave maybe? Either way, ew!! Plus side my salad was cold but oddly closer to that room temperature feel (given over 100 outside cold to warm food is acceptable, warm to cold is just inconceivable this time of year)..\n\nLastly I feel like they were a little over priced for the size of tacos we received. Like tiny small, I'm all for quality ingredients but lack there of is kind of a slight at $3-$4 a PIECE.. \n\nI would be willing to give it one more try, but I won't be going out of my way if I have a choice..\n\n\n\n\n\nAwful service, hit and miss food.  It was a revolving door on the wait staff.  Our waitress showed her face to take our order then everyone else had to pick up the slack.  I had to flag down bus staff for drink refills.  The good taco was the braised beef and the rest was okay.  Really the service is what blew it.  Walked up to the manager to have him tab me out after waiting 10 min with a cleared table.  Then he forgot to return my card.  Not going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery hip place to be. I love the decor, the music, and just the general ambiance. \n\nWe seemed to be served by all the servers, who were all friendly. They would all basically come up to us, and ask us how we were doing, and if we had ordered yet. Not sure if they were doing this on purpose, or if they were really disorganized that night.\n\nOrdered the carne asada taco, crispy fish, ahi tuna, and braised beef. I thought 3.5+ for 1 taco was expensive, but surprisingly they were pretty beefy tacos. 3 will leave you satisfied/full. They were all delicious and the salsa is quite spicy. My only disappoint is that half of the tacos came out cold, which gives you a harder tortilla and cold meat. They were still good, but could have been better.\n\nAlso ordered churros with chocolate salsa. They were alright, a little doughy, and not thin and crispy enough to my liking.\n\n\n3/5 Would eat here on a rare occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat taco shop!  Good food, drinks, and sides with excellent service. Set in the heart of downtown Gilbert, Joyride is a great take on street tacos.\n\nWe started with the free chips and salsa (second order only $2) and some ceviche. The size of the salsa and ceviche was small and wasn't enough for two people.\n\nOrdered three different tacos and a side of cucumber orange salad.  All tacos were good and the salad was excellent.  We ordered the fish taco, but they were out of it. Guess I should have went down the street if I wanted fish tacos.\n\nThe drinks are probably Joyride's best menu choice. We had the Cucumber Mint Agua Fresca.  Definitely our best decision.\n\nWith all the wonderful choices in downtown Gilbert Joyride is a good eatery, better drinkery, with five star service.\n\nStop by if you're into chips, salsa, street tacos, and delicious drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe moved from central Phoenix and have been to the Joyride on Central multiple times. Great food, great service. We just left Federal Pizza, owned by the same company on Central. Just like always.. excellent food and service. My family has been to Joyride in Gilbert multiple times and it's been a disappointment each time. The service is sub par. It's as if the servers are stressed and almost annoyed which transfers a negative dining experience. The staff doesn't handle pressure well at all.  Great food but the staff needs to step it up.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really like coming here after a long day at work! I tend to come like an hour or so before closing time, and I find the dim interior and loud music kind of relaxing in a way. The food here is pricey but delicious. My favorite things to order here are three tacos plus a side, the carne asada nachos, and the brownie. They're more often than not out of my budget I'm an unfortunate soul who can't make it to happy hour but I remember the margaritas being good, too.\n\nI actually want to give this place a 3.5/5 for service reasons. I'm not sure if this only happens late at night, but I seem to never get one consistent waiter to take care of me; I usually end up having to call over different people to get refills, see the menu again, etc. because no one person gives the standard occasional check-in, which can be a tad bit annoying. I've also noticed dirty dishes laid out on tables for use several times, which was off-putting.\nOn another note, I remember my girlfriend wanted hot tea once because her stomach was upset; the menu said there was hot tea available, so she ordered it, only for the waitress to just rudely say, \"No, we don't have that. We've never had that.\" Just saying, a place shouldn't say it sells something if it doesn't...\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat chips and salsa, nachos, and guac.  Tacos are mediocre.  Don't get the tuna tacos, they are NOT good.  Crispy tacos are good.\n\nI fear this place won't last long unless they just pick up the overflow from the other busy restaurants.  I expected more from the postinos owned restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis joint is always packed but I don't care about the wait when the tacos are incredible. I ventured out and got something new this time around, I absolutely love the crispy fish, the standard, and the pork adobada. \nFamily got the beast burritos and my little loves the quesadilla. I would recommend the entire menu, especially the drinks too. Come at happy hour to get more for your money on drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Joyride taco house! Whoa! Love it!! Addicted. Fun place for the whole family!\n\n\n\n\n\nA bit of a wait most nights but an outstanding place to eat. Only thing I'd wish they would change is for the margaritas to have a frozen option, But don't worry they're still delicious\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickly becoming one of my favorite joints in downtown Gilbert! Joyride has great food with a great vibe. Trio of tacos is a fantastic deal with diner's choice of ten different tacos. My favorite three are shrimp, fish, and braised beef and, since the side dish comes with, the back beans. I suggest eating at the bar. The bartenders make it a fun experience with their service and making sure the right games are on. In the booth, it's perfect for get togethers! Side note - the old school early 90's hip hop that happened to be playing was the cherry on top. On a final note, to the owner of Joyride, your manager is absolutely fantastic. He is epitome of the Joyride customer experience and his staff follows his lead. My server accidentally forgot my dish and he made sure to come by, apologize, thank me for my understanding and ask what dessert he could bring the table to make up for it. The pudding. The answer is always, \"The pudding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a cute place. \nGood size menu and pretty good alcohol selection. \nChips and salsa were very good. \nShrimp ceviche did not impress my boyfriend but I liked it. \nTacos were just fine. I expected to love the Baja fish taco but it was disappointing. \nThe standard was pretty good. \nMy boyfriend loved the battered fish taco. \nFor dessert the bf had some banana Carmel bread pudding thing. Can't remember the name. \nI had the churros. \nI loved mine, he was not excited with either of them.\n$5 pitchers is a good deal. \nGood service! \n\nOverall I think the food is overpriced for the quality. $13 for ceviche it really should be more impressive\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I went first to Joy Ride back when it opened about 4.5 years ago. I really enjoyed the uniqueness of the dishes and came back a couple of times. Then, a year later I came back and their menu had drastically changed and the meal I got that my server recommended (since my previous meal was no longer there) was very spicy (but I am SUPER sensitive to that). I was totally disappointed that whatever I used to order was no longer on the menu. But I guess it hadn't been that popular or else they wouldn't have changed it. The atmosphere is good and the food to me is just now \"OK.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Joyride! The tacos are amazing, the queso is awesome, the tea is magnificient! I even like the cucumber orange salad and I don't usually eat any types of salads! The service has always been great when I've been there. Even when the person I was with sent something back. They took care of it and the manager came over to check that everything was better when the alternate taco came out.\n\nThe lunch special is pretty great too!\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall the food was really tasty.  However, enchilada style means only enchilada sauce, no cheese.  Also, they need to clean their meat a little better.  The carne asada had a lot of funky bits in it.  I will go back though.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride makes up for some inconsistency in flavor profiles with a super cool ambience, friendly and capable service, and reasonable pricing.  Some of the tacos we ordered were well-seasoned and flavorful, and others slightly bland - the shrimp could have been fresher.  The nachos were to DIE for, but the side of pinto beans was heavily over salted.  \n\nThe setup is open with a hip and inviting color scheme that speaks to the casual and laid-back vibe.  There is a sizable bar with interesting drinks (aguas frescas) which are all spike-able.  \n\nThe hostess was probably the friendliest person I've ever met and servers were definitely capable and friendly.  A little more work on food consistency and this place would easily earn a 5-star rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere. .good location. .nice food.\nSlightly pricey though. \nThe icing on the cake is the drinks which are awesome. They have the right mix and content of alcohol which is usually missing in most of the joints.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing!!! It's our first night here and we weren't greeted for about 10 minutes at our table, the manager comes up to us and comps are our meal the best customer service I've seen EVEr!!!! Plus to tacos are off the hook!!! Nothing Taco Bell about this place yummy!!! Deeply satisfied :)\n\n\n\n\n\nI had heard a lot of buz about this place and the food was just okay. I has the carne asada and was terribly disappointed. I've had a lot of carne asadas in my time and never has been so fatty. The reason for the 4  rating is because of the staff. My waitress Dee was awesome and informative and very accommodating. I will try again.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusy lunch spot, parking was the biggest challenge. Once inside we opted for the bar.  Wow, the drinks are amazing. \nChips and salsa can easily fill you while you are waiting to place your order.  Good thing they were fast with the drinks. \nWe all had tacos, nothing special.   The drinks however, WOW.  Get the prickly pear,  yum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is AMAZING! The drinks are unique and fresh and the atmosphere has a California cool meets hipster vibe. We love this place and it's located in the heart of downtown Gilbert. The service is the only thing we haven't had good luck with, but we keep going back because the food is just that good.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dig it. The tacos were really good. I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken taco but we tried the carnitas, the other pork option that I can't recall the name of and the carne asada and those were all really good. The guac was also good. I really like the outdoor area and will love to try it out when it cools down. The interior is small, but comfortable. The servers were really attentive and polite.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I got a gift card that we wanted to use from Joyride since we had never been here before- and we will definitely be back!! From the hostess to the waiter to the food- everything was wonderful! The chips and salsa were great- and we ordered both the Joyride and the Blood Orange Margaritas. Fantastic! Then we ordered 3 tacos each: The fish taco(1 grilled & 1 breaded), carnitas taco, chicken taco, carne asada taco and my favorite- the veggie taco! We also got the orange/cucumber salad and the mexican slaw. This will be our go to place for great tasting tacos!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely the best tacos and tamales we've ever eaten anywhere. Adding to that, the service and atmosphere of this restaurant were both exceptional!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I had high expectations because I'm such a fan of Postinos, and I probably hyped it up too much in my mind...\n\nCute, stylish decor, as expected. We opted to sit on the patio (unfortunately) because it was an hour wait for an inside table. It wasn't too bad because they have misters.\n\nWe were served water and chips and salsa right away. Thank god because I was starving! I really liked the salsa. Not a big fan of the chips though. Too thick for my taste.\n\nI got the cucumber mint aqua fresca and OMG...it was SO good! It sucked it down so fast! Our dining companions got the pineapple and said it was too sweet.\n\nAnd since it was our first time at the taco house, we got tacos. The carne asada, baja fish, shrimp, and fried fish. They were all so so good! Carne asada was so flavorful and the meat was really tender. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of shrimp.  I was disappointed that there was such a small amount of fish in the fish tacos, but they were delicious. I was really pleased with the food. In fact, I usually take pics but we dove right in and they were gone before I got a chance!\n\nWhere they lose 2 stars for me is that I feel it is overpriced and I received lackluster service. Which is weird because I don't think Postinos is overpriced. But really, $4 for ONE small taco? Come on! That's ridiculous.  Also, the service was, meh. Not friendly, indifferent really. It wasn't rude but it wasn't the great service I usually experience at Postinos, so I thought that was bizarre.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love love love the ambiance of the restaurant. It is fun and funky, great youth for Gilbert! The margaritas are great and you can't really mess up chips and salsa!\n\nHaving worked in restaurants for 6 years, I have probably sent food back less than 5 times in my life. Joyride would be one of those times. Very bland carne asada. Management was great in offering me something else and giving me coupons for my next visit - I really appreciate the customer service. \n\nSo basically, I will go back, but I will stick to drinks and apps :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decor and surroundings are fun and inviting but, the food and service was average. We had the enchiladas and tacos that were just so, so.  They never brought more chips and salsa and they never refilled our drinks. Now, we never asked but having two daughters that work in the restaurant industry, I know what's expected. Would I go back? Probably not, unless I was with friends that wanted to go. I would much rather have SoCal Tacos right down the street for half the price and ten times better.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food, a little pricey. It's always PACKED and honestly the food is not worth a 45 minute wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nLol......well it hit 100 degrees and all the snowbirds are gone. So now i can go out to eat!! \nGood service.....water refills were on point \nTacos were tastey along with great tasting free chips and salsa.\nHad the beast burrito.......it was ok......refried beans in it....really?? \nFor me ...,refried beans are the opposite of fresh mexican .\n\nMade it out with a 25.00 bill for two, tip included.......by drinking water.\nAlcohol has become a ridiculous waste of money and their beer , wine and drinks come at a premium. But....they do have happy hour prices.\n\nIf your going to eat and drink...expect  15.00- 20.00 + bucks a person .\nIts the ultimate hipster hangout so expect music and hip people wearing hip clothing\nTo be buzzing around.\n\n\n\n\n\nA very cute and vibrant spot! Loved the patio seating, and a fun place to go for a quick date night, or meeting with some girlfriends. \n\nThe tacos are very good, but small so if you're a big eater you might want to get a little extra. \n\nIt can get busy quick (especially at night), so make sure to come a little ahead of time to grab some parking and put your name down on the list. \n\nHave fun!\n\n\n\n\n\nI enjoyed this place quite a bit. I had three different types of tacos. I liked the carne asada best. The meat had a slightly Asian flavor due to the marinade that my wife didn't care for. My wife liked the veggie taco. This place has a cool funky vibe. Be prepared to wait there is always a ton of people.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we had excellent service. The servers were so on top of everything. We enjoyed the different types of margaritas they offer. Mine was Serrano chili with cucumber and it was very good. More of a drink to slowly enjoy. The server was knowledgeable about the drinks and was spot-on about the heat levels and recommendations. The only issue we had was the really tiny table. It felt like we couldn't move at all. When the menu was moved on the table, the really light weight plastic water cup tipped right over and embarrassingly spilled water and ice all over. Ugh. I hope they get different cups. The staff helped us immediately, however. \n\nThey do play great music and overall enjoyed our time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my favorite taco spot on a Tuesday. The food is delicious and the drinks are strong. My friends and I have never had bad service and we keep coming back every week!\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause this place is so close to home, I feel badly to say that I'm not a fan. The first time we came here many months ago, it took 30-45 minutes just for our food to arrive at the table. I don't remember disliking the meal, or anyone else having complaints. However, last night we went back and did not like anything. \n\nThe kids nachos were burnt and not very appetizing. \n\nThe Baja tacos were dry, bland, and the added salsa and other garnishments on top did not help make it better.  \n\nPinto beans had no flavor..\n\nThe beef in the beef tacos was shredded and over cooked (Crispy over cooked). Not my preference for a beef taco I guess. \n\nMy boyfriend really disliked that we didn't have 1 waiter. We had several different people (some waiters, some bussers) come to our table to try and assist. What I really disliked the most, more than anything else was how loud the music inside was. It was way too loud for the place. You had to fight to talk louder than the music, that's just not enjoyable. It's a restaurant with families and kids inside, not just a bar. \n\nI'm giving 2 stars because I really liked the 1 busser we saw more than once who came to our table more than once and was very friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's surprisingly hard to find a GOOD taco place in AZ. I'm so particular about them. But these were absolutely amazing and not insanely overpriced. And they have THE BEST salsas!!! I had gotten all of them.. because once again.. I'm so particular lol.. And each one was sooo delicious-- you can taste the freshness.\nKeep  it up =) I'm definitely coming back\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should only be eating here if you care about being seen and want to be surrounded by hipsters.\n\nThe tacos were some of the most bland i have ever had.  Add that to the price and there is absolutely no reason to go here.\n\nSo sad to see people flocking here when the food is sooo underwhelming.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad been wanting to try this place since it is so close to me. There always seems to be a pretty good crowd there. Went for dinner on 12/7/13. Service was good and the waitress was informative when we had questions because there are a few funky items on the menu. We asked if we could get the vegetable enchiladas without mushroom and the waitress said no because they are all pre made? Food was ok, everything is a la carte so it gets pretty pricey. Not sure I'll be back unless it's just for drinks, just not for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my fianc ate here for the first time today and the food was delicious. I had a blood orange margarita for my drink which was very yummy. We both decided to do the 3 tacos and a side of our choosing. I got a carne asada, the standard and a shrimp taco with a side of black beans. The fianc got a carne asada, carnitas and a baja fish taco with pinto beans as a side. The weather was nice out so we sat on the outside patio while enjoying our visit here. We will definitely be back for sure!!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the best customer service tonight at joyride.  I didn't even tell my waitress I didn't like my food. She asked me what can I get since you don't like your food. I said nothing I'm fine. Then the manager came out and said I'm not leaving till I ordered something else and it would be on them. I ordered some braised beef tacos and they were amazing. The customer service I had tonight was AMAZING.  They went out of there way to make me happy. Something that you don't usually get when you go out. Very impressed with there service.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood, but not great.  My experience was similar to that of other yelpers.\n- cool atmosphere\n- condiments were the star more so than the actual food.  Excellent salsa\n- drinks were delicious, but mostly ice\n\n\n\n\n\nWe received a gift card and went back to try Joyride again.  We have been back 3 times since my first review.  We obviously love the tacos, because we keep coming back.  Definitely go on Tuesday or during happy hour for $2 tacos!\n\nThe service is still hit or miss, sometimes it is good, sometimes you have to ask for things multiple times.  You never know how its gonna be.\n\nWe try something new every time we go....the beans...huge disappointment, don't waste your money!  The cheese y mas is very good!!  Not worth the normal price of $9.00 (outrageous), but we will get it again during happy hour for $4.00.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything we had was excellent. Great flavors, reasonably priced, and not too heavy. Will be coming back for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to stop here after finding it on Yelp - so glad we did. The atmosphere is casual, but not overly so. Our server, Taylor, was one of the most knowledgable and bubbly servers I've ever had. She knew about all the food and had great recommendations (based on our tastes) and even made me feel just fine for ordering an item plain (standard taco with just chicken and cheese). The blood orange margarita is phenomenal and not terribly priced. I HIGHLY recommend the \"Better than Betty's\" dessert - it's brownie, ice cream, caramel, and walnuts but oh man. So delicious. If you're in the area - make it a point to check this place out...ASK FOR TAYLOR (this is extremely important)...and get some dessert. You'll thank me for it later. Ugh...so full.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tacos and street corn.  It's always packed and it's super loud.  But good service and good food.\n\n\n\n\n\nI loved the mango-mandarin margarita. It was awesome. Definitely try the standard, crispy fish, and pork adobada tacos. The servers were friendly and attentive.  I'm looking forward to coming back\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere do I start...came here due to a recommendation from a co-worker who's local. The place is great, whether you are coming here on a date, with friends, or in my case, alone (because you're on a work trip and others are too lame to drive more than a block for dinner). It's such a cute place and open setting so very welcoming. In doors or outdoors, no matter where you sit, you'll love it.\n\nSat at the bar and at the recommendation of the bartender, had one of their agua frescas (citrus) with tequila which was very refreshing and delicious. Ordered 3 tacos (braised beef, fried fish and chicken tinga) which comes w a choice of a side. No other comment except FKN DELICIOUS (the tacos that is)! \n\nI then ordered a spicy cucumber drink which was pretty fantastic. I love that their drinks are refreshing and not heavy just because their alcoholic. \n\nOnly disappointment was the rice which didn't seem to be cooked enough but not a big enough deal that would keep me from coming back to this place! I WILL BE BACK!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBest bang for your buck taco Happy Hour! $2 Tacos Paired with $5 Margaritas or pitchers. Can't beat it. My husband loves their Carne Asada Tacos. My favs include the chicken tinga and crispy fish. All of them are super fresh and flavorful! Huge patio and good sized bar. All the staff was friendly and efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food ! Great service , the Carne Asada tacos are the best I have ever eaten. Will be coming back again!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat outdoor dining!  My husband and I came here because I had a voucher for a free appetizer, which happened to include any app! We got Carne asada nachos ($15) and they were so delicious. There was no lack of toppings and they were extremely flavorful. \nWe also ordered a chicken burrito ($10) which was huge, but didn't have sides or anything. \nThe service was quick and very friendly. We never ran out of water.  The first round of chips and salsa is free!  \nI wish the prices were a smidgen more reasonable, but overall we are for sure coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\nCute decor and delicious food. The tacos are small street tacos so if you come really hungry, it can get a little pricey. I've tried all of the tacos, except for the ones with seafood, and all of them were very tasty. There is a good selection of beer and other alcoholic beverages. I really like all of the watermelon drink concoctions they have, but everything I've tried is delicous. I enjoy coming here for drinks and smaller meals. I like to come during week days on sort of off hours when its not as crowded.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a lot smaller inside than I expected but they have a patio I will definitely check out when it's cooler. Came on a Tuesday at 5:30 and told we had a 20 minute wait but it ended up more like 45 minutes. Not a big deal since we brought our drinks outside. The margaritas tasted fresh and are on special for $5 on Tuesdays along with tacos. I'll be coming back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been wanting to try this place since they opened up a while ago. Several of my friends have been now several times and I finally got to go check it out. I am a fan. It is a great place to go with friends and have a nice conversation and meal. The tacos are quite pricey (hence the four stars) but they are tasty as well. There is also the street corn that my buddy got when we went there. He likes corn and he said it was pretty good. Overall, I would go back again, but only with friends. At least for me this locale is not somewhere I would go by myself due to the pricy-ness for Mexican food. Honestly, it's more of an American-Mexican fusion type of food place. Authentic Mexican foodies beware! Americanized ethnic foodies go here!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here twice and plan on going back again!  My first visit was almost a year ago. It was a Friday night and really busy. My friend and I were given a 45 min -hour wait but we were lucky that some people left the bar so we ate there. The tacos and drinks were great and I kept telling myself I have to come back!\nI visited again a couple days ago for a work gathering. We were there during happy hour which they have $2 tacos as part of their special. I tried the Carne Asada, the Standard and Chicken Tinga tacos. We also shared the street corn, guacamole, and the churros with chocolate on the side. The carne asada, street corn and guacamole was lacking flavor but rest of the food was good. Service was good. They didn't look to busy and we had about 4 people serving our table of 8 so it was confusing to figure out who was our server. The atmosphere was fun and inviting. I am curious to try out some more food so I plan on going back and I'll take some pictures for ya! =)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had to choose one word to sum up my latest trip to Joyride it would be: Egh.\n\nMy wife and I went for happy hour on a Friday night. As we walk in patio side we see one table open. We check in and are told it would be a 10 minute wait. 15 minutes later, were seated at that same open table! \n\nThe menu states $2 tacos during happy hour. Sounds like a pretty good deal. In addition, if you order 3 tacos, you get a side for $1. So, we order 3 tacos each and a side (for a dollar extra as advertised by both the menu AND our server).\n\nTacos come out fast enough, but not with the sides. Had to remind our server for those. I asked for hot sauce, it was delivered several minutes later. Our waters were not refilled ONCE the entire meal, even though we mentioned it a few times.\n\nThe bill: came out with all the tacos and sides at full price. I was quick to correct the server. She took the bill and said she'd take care of it. 5 minutes later another server comes out with a new bill. You would think she was describing advanced calculus to justify the reason why some tacos are at actual price and some are at happy hour prices and why the sides are not a dollar extra during happy hour. So confused. I was ready to pay and get the hell out.\n\nGood thing SoCal fish company is right down the street. I won't be back anytime soon.\n\nOnly reason it's 2 stars was for mediocre tacos. Service was baaaaad.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOVE THIS PLACE! Great ceviche and listen to me when I tell you this... make sure to get the \"STANDARD TACO\". It's seriously the best taco in the menu but everything else is good too. This just tops it. Margaritas are strong and delicious. Guac tastes fresh. Only issue is the fish taco is 0/2 as we've attempted it a couple times and it's way too fishy. The margaritas are amazing too and with a happy hour every day until 5 where they're $5, you can't beat it!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped here for a quick bite before heading to another spot and we stumbled upon their $2 Taco Tuesday.  Although you cannot select any taco from the menu the choices provided are quite good.  I had 3 tacos the Standard which was my favorite, the pork was okay and the carne was typical, no surprises.  I have to say that the Prickly Pear margarita was the absolute best!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a very late dinner here and was very excited to try this place out. The atmosphere is very laid back and the hostess nicely greeted us when she saw us walk in. We had the taco platter and ordered the beast burrito. The meat was deliciously flavored and I loved the fact the there tortillas are freshly made! There salsa is so good and spicy and we couldn't get enough. To finish off our meal we ordered churros which tasted freshly made! I can't wait to come back and have some more great tasting tacos!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service friendly staff. One of my favorite taco places for taco Tuesday. Nothing beats $2 tacos and $5 margs!! Cheers\n\n\n\n\n\nI have lived here and have not tried this restaurant until today. I always see huge lines and my friends posting pictures on taco Tuesdays. I came here for lunch and their lunch special of 2 tacos and a salad or side for $9 is a great deal. The chips and salsa were just okay. The tacos I was expecting to be great based upon how popular this place was, but I was disappointed. I felt like my two tacos lacked flavor and were very basic. Nothing about this place wowed me to the point were I would probably come back. Just think there is better taco places out there.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest place to eat dinner! Everyone was so nice and the food was delicious! We had the street tacos and nachos. Everything had a lot of flavor and was super fresh! The wait staff and manager were the nicest of any restaurant I've been too. Will definitely go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing food! I came 2 nights in a row while in Gilbert. I would give it more than 5 stars if i could! All food is made fresh on premises, you can tell!  Great service, great atmosphere, great prices, but most amazing food! The sweet mexican corn was my favorite.  You can also tell tortillas are homemade =)\n\n\n\n\n\nDalton made me the most mediocre Manhattan i've ever had. Yet, it was one of the best drinks I've consumed, on account of such an awesome team here.\n\nChristian keeps the team's spirits up, with the hardest job in the restaurant.\nTony slangs drinks. \nMJ is calm and collected. \nGustavo is awesome. \nEmily is new. She brings an air of newness. \nAshlynn makes everyone feel included. \n\nAmanda brings great ideas and keeps her team together.\n\nThere are many others that make Joyride a perfect speakeasy. I hope to get to know the rest of them one day. You should too. \n\nAlso, the happy hour kicks ass.\n\n\n\n\n\nMUST GO AGAIN!!!! Most awesome fish tacos! Happy Hour includes taco, guacamole, & drink specials! Wait staff was great - they all helped each other bring food & drinks out! Audra was SUPER!! Atmosphere was great!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far tacos go I haven't had anything better and I lived in scottsdale for a few years and tried everything.  Only taking a star away because we've had a few occasions where they got our order mixed up\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was awesome you dont see these kinds of places in Philly and with cheap prices. Food was so good and the service was exceptional. She was really nice and energetic and made me feel really comfortable :) I am only in AZ for one more week and I def have to come back before I leave.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood tastes great. You don't get alot of food for the price.I took my family there it was nice.  We went during the summer.  My son enjoyed the outside misters.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery casual and laid back place downtown Gilbert with great margaritas and tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nStumbled in here to escape the 115 degree heat and really glad we did! The tropicale margarita was great, it's a blend of coconut tequila, pineapple and I believe passion fruit. Sounded sweet but the flavors really balanced themselves out. I had the carne asada, carnitas and chicken tinga tacos. Carne asada one was a little dry, nothing a little lime couldn't fix. The $1 black beans on the side were awesome; not dry and tasted great mixed with the fire roasted salsa. The salsa by the way... oh my god it's so good. I get why the refills are $2 because I could see a lot of people ordering 5 sides of it if it was free  All in all it was a great experience. I don't live in the Gilbert area so I'd be great if you guys opened a location in Phoenix somewhere!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood customer service. Not too expensive for being in the middle of downtown Gilbert. Be sure you go during happy hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food great service!! The crispy fish taco, hands down the best fish taco I've had to date!!! Also the cucumber mint with sapphire gin is amazing. If you are ever at the bar Kyle is your go to bartender!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere. Drinks are refreshing.  My wife loves their pineapple mojitos and the mazatlan mules are tasty. \n\nThe tacos are pricy (about $4) for a tiny taco but they are good. The crispy fish taco is the best fish taco I've had in az. I also had the braised beef tacos which were good as well. \n\nDefinitely worth going back\n\n\n\n\n\n'hip' taco joint, really? gilbert is not nor will ever be in the least bit hip. Told it was a 20 minute wait on a wednesday nite and waited for an hour. strike one. Waiter asked if we wanted to see the menus, seriously? don't they teach you this on the first day of training? strike two. chips were way too salty and only one kind of salsa was chincy strike 2 1/2. i have had better tacos off of taco trucks in Yuma for 1/3 the cost. if you really feel that you can open a restaurant catering to 20-30 somethings and forget about everyone else I can envision the 'for rent' sign on your window much sooner rather than later. and finally, booths that seat 6 with 2 people sitting in them.  who ever designed this place should immediately be fired. poor layout, fair food, clueless servers. make that one star. want real food with knowledgeable service at fair prices? try si senor on alma school in chandler\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat happy hour spot in Downtown Gilbert. During happy hour (2-6pm), there is a good selection of fish tacos and $5 margaritas. \n\nI've had three types of tacos: The Standard, Carnitas, and Fish. The fish was by far the best; it was crispy and the fish was cooked perfectly. The Standard and Carnitas tacos are decent, but not memorable. I pleasantly surprised at how strong the blood orange margarita as for $5, I expected a watered down one. The churros and chocolate are good as well. Not exactly authentic, but a good spot nonetheless. \n\nOnly real complaint was that they were skimpy with the salsa and guacamole.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst impression looking for this restaurant wasn't that great - half of the lights on the sign were out. I'm glad we stayed to try it out though! The staff was friendly upon arrival, and we were sat immediately. The decorations were very modern and I noticed that the left wall could open up to include the patio as part of the restaurant, which was pretty cool. Seems to be a great spot for lunch especially during nice weather. The salsa was different and I remember it having a bit of spice to it, which I love. I only wish the portion size could have been bigger! Not that we left hungry. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer and almost filled up on that. They were very good and fresh. I'm not sure what it was, but the green salsa on top tied everything together for me although all of the ingredients had a lot of flavor. We also ordered a fish taco al a carte and the Bandit Taco platter. Both were very good, although nothing in particular is jumping to my memory. Overall, very good experience I will definitely be back to try the lunch menu!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was actually trying to go to postinos- my AZ friends won't stop talking about it. I accidentally walked into joyride instead, So glad i did!!! Everything I had was insanely good. I love the funk decor, great music, very friendly (and good looking) staff. Service was quick! There's outdoor and indoor seating- it's comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. The food was yum. Yum YUM!! I had 3 tacos- braised beef, Tinga, and pork. First off all it's awesome that they even have Tinga on their menu. But the fact that it was good?! I'm grateful for being so tired after work to make this restaurant mistake. Oh!!! They serve aguas frescas too- they're take on them anyway. I had a cucumber one and I wish I had that recipe. I only wish I lived locally so I can return over abc over again.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently had the famous Joyride Taco's. I had a shrimp, carnita and two crispy fish tacos. The first two were good, the crispy fish were fantastic, I highly recommend! We finished off the meal with the chocolate churros which were god as well and perfect for sharing. Overall good experience and solid food.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent during happy hour and had the strawberry agua fresca with vodka, it was so refreshing and for a great price. Also had the ahi tuna ceviche, was a little spicy but again great flavor. Must try the chicken burrito! Was a great experience all around and can't wait to go again!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood here is pretty tasty but not as good as some. Meat was a little over cooked and tacos were plain. Plus specials weren't great! Still will eat there just giving an honest review\n\n\n\n\n\nReally awesome food, good portion sizes and the salsa is fresh and awesome! \n\nThough I do wish they would give more salsa with their food, it was a great experience and atmosphere!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have never had a negative experience here really. I have sent back one plate I think since coming here. I come to Joyride at least once a week and always get the 3 tacos with a free side and always have some nachos. Having some churro's with a dark chocolate dipping sauce is also delicious at the end of the meal. \nIt's a very chill, relaxed place to hangout and have lunch or dinner. Every so often I will go in by myself and sit at the bar, have some tacos and just enjoy watching some TV. The staff is always super friendly and the food is extremely consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome Happy hour specials and patio!\n\nThe happy hour $2 taco special is great! We love to try the different tacos and for $2 each your not out too much if it's not your thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has fun atmosphere and with the roll up doors is a nice place to visit during the winter.  So, grab a bucket of beers and enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took a few minutes for anyone to greet me once I arrived, however, staff was friendly and helpful with selections. \n\nThe environment is great! Very urban and hip like their other restaurants in Central Phoenix. They have Local First AZ books at the front which I'm a big fan of. Cool vintage steering wheels and headlights hang around the interior walls... Lots of group seating which is perfect for get-togethers. \n\nWe ordered three tacos (crispy fish, short rib and chicken) and a carne asada burrito to share. In my opinion, the tacos are a bit overpriced for what you get, but everything else seems normal price wise. \n\nThe carne asada burrito is a BIG YES - absolutely delicious. The crispy fish tacos are also really good. The chicken taco was fine (not worth $3.50). The short rib taco is a complete \"pass\" in my book. All I tasted was the corn tortilla. \n\nAll in all, I loved it and will be back!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, 1st time here and I must say, DISAPPOINTED!!I know a few people who have recommend this joint. My brother, from Texas,  was here visiting and on his last day we decided to try .THIS place could be considered * Trendy* I call it artsy fartsy!! I wanted good tacos..  \nI ended up with a lunch special of 2 tacos and a side. Now, these are small street tacos.  Corn or flour tortillas.  I had a braised beef ( shredded) and 1 shrimp taco. The side was a salad. Not traditional.  Kale based with crunchy dried peas, jicama, tomatoes and corn with cojita cheese. Chips were good and salsa was fresh and had just enough kick.  The chicken burrito plate was huge!!! All in all not my style for tacos and a bit pricey!!  Charging for a chips and salsa refill is ridiculous!!!  3 stars is for great service at the bar, MO AND TONY took good care of us.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Joyride again tonight. Had the chicken burrito. ***AMAZING** That is one fine burrito. My wife and I each ordered a margarita. OOPS!!! Delicious, YES, but small and $9.00 each. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!! I will not order that again. WOW!~!! This is a 4.75 - 5.00 drink and it is really good but MASSIVE OVERPRICE. The service was excellent again. Definitely go to this place but, watch those drink prices. WHEW!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Joy Ride today and was disappointed. The service was wonderful and attentive but the ceviche did not really have much shrimp and the tacos were light in filling. The ceviche had maybe 2 shrimp for 12.5 not a great value. However, the shrimp that we did try was seasoned well and tasted great. The carne asada taco again, great flavor little meat. I began to wonder today with the lunch specials that they offer are they skimping other places? Bummer... Joy ride is one of my favorites places to go. I love the funky atmosphere and food but it not really living up to my experiences there. I hope that in the future they get back to where they used to be fusing all aspects of dining: great atmosphere, great tasting food and providing a great to good value.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the pork tamales and they were pretty good. The meat was nice and moist and flavorful. The aqua fresca's were excellent as well. My wife had the horchata with a splash of amaretto added and it was tasty. I tried both of their margaritas, the blood orange and the house and they were very good. My wife had the enchilata's and she enjoyed them.\n\nMy only complaint to this place is the drink prices of their speciality drinks. When it's not happy hour they are $10 each. If you like to have a few drinks, it would be best to visit here during happy hour which offers some great prices for drinks along with food. We will be back and plan on trying their happy hour food/drinks next.\n\nForgot to mention, we were able to get seated right away, service was excellent and food came out really fast. We were in and out within an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is really nice it has beautiful outside dinning and the food is pretty good especially if you're hungry on a Saturday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first time here, we showed up with a group of 12 people on a Saturday night and almost got laughed out of the place but all with a great sense of humor. They set up a place for us outside, which was mighty kind of them, and we had a wonderful evening.\nI hate to give a review based on one evening and I definitely plan to come back soon and really experience the place.\nFrom a \"first look\" perspective-the food is fresh and interesting-loved the complimentary smoky salsa-I had bites of several kinds of tacos and enjoyed all of them. The Blood Orange Margarita is tasty but like others have commented-it's a wee bit of drink for the price. \nI get the concept and I love it-fabulous ambience-fresh ingredients-unusual flavor profiles, clearly not Rubios-this is a destination place. But, that being said, Arizonians are used to great Mexican that doesn't bust the wallet. \nI'll be back for a second look!\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BANDIT TACO PLATTER was the choice for dinner, all three tacos where very good but my favorite was the Carnitas tacos. Also had the pineapple mojito which was very good!\n\n\n\n\n\nWowzers! This place's food is Rock&Roll in your mouth. Great service and great ambiance. The food is obviously prepared with fresh ingredients and you can tell. The meats they use in their tacos are slow cooked to perfection with love. Small portions on the street tacos and higher then expected price point but satisfied nonetheless. \n\nMy only mark down comes from when we requested some cucumber slices instead of chips for the salsa. The cucumbers they delivered had mold on them. They were very apologetic; however, it should have been noticed (appeared the cucumbers came from the bar not the kitchen). Not to take anything away from their chips as they were really good and salsa outstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has a great atmosphere and fun craft cocktails, but during our visit the host staff was less than cordial. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the food and service, but our first impression at the door was mediocre. We will give them another shot, though. Sometimes people have bad days!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride, best fish tacos and good for welcoming Moriah's two new additions. Also they were kind enough to make me coffee and bring Everett regular and chocolate milk.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a group of 6 and a baby and we were all impressed by this non-traditional Mexican restaurant. With items like squash and goat cheese enchiladas and a dozen different tacos to choose from, each was extremely satisfied with their food. I also thought it was a nice, strong but not-too-sweet marg. loved the decor and kid-friendliness outdoors. The only small complaint was they didn't have a dedicated waitress per table, we kept being helped by different people, so you could say requests were a little slow, but the food came out fast. Maybe it was a Sunday night thing. Can't wait to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food and good drinks! The ambiance is chill and the happy hour menu is great as well!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is overpriced Mexican food, and doesn't even have as much flavor as many of their less expensive competitors in the east valley. Tacos the size of my wife's palm should not be $4.50 each, especially considering the unimpressive flavors (of the shrimp and crispy fish). The \"Mexican coleslaw\" tasted like regular coleslaw and was a dripping wet addition to a lackluster taco. The lunch special ordered was $9.75 for two tiny tacos, and a bowl of soup. Chips and salsa are complimentary but I felt the salsa was overwhelmed by onions. \n\nThe tortilla soup was good, I do admit, and is the only thing I'd go back for. The service at lunch was attentive and they have an extensive bar menu, so I believe the target audience is for hipsters having a night out, rather than those looking for a delicious and filling meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nKind of a crazy place during rush times ... but they did well in handling it all.  We were seated within 20 mins ... and points for keeping track ... and making sure people were seated in the order of their arrival.  Food was really good.  Maybe the best Mexican we've had since moving to Gilbert, AZ.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place. We do work happy hours here and all and enjoy their margaritas, tacos and mexican street corn!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood atmosphere and tasty options. Good service and full bar. Nice addition to gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent Margarita, chips were warm and fresh. Baja grilled fish taco was really good, and our servers were very friendly and attentive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mojitos are worth the visit alone. This place is awesome. Great vibe, great service, and the food is good too. A bit of a wait on the weekends as this place is very popular. It has indoor and outdoor seating and is located in the heart of downtown Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't talk, stuffing face! Nachos are outrageous! This is my 5th \"ride\" and have yet to be disappointed. Service has always been top notch, soup excellent, burros rock and the tacos... ahhh, the tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere was fun and vibrant...reminded us of Austin.  The tacos were a bit bland, but the margaritas were great!  Not sure if we would go back for the food, but the drinks and atmosphere were great!\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved this place! My husband got a steak quesadilla which was fresh and the meat was juicy, tender and flavored perfectly. I wasn't very hungry but wanted to try a taco so I went with the crispy fish, so glad I did. It was really good. The restaurant was pretty packed and the workers were all busy but the service was fantastic. Can't wait to go back !\n\n\n\n\n\nJust had my first visit to Joyride and I loved it! I had an amazing salad, the drinks are wonderfully refreshing and the atmosphere is heavenly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is average if you even get it while it's still warm. The staff is so nonchalant and could really care less. It takes forever to get in and out of here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is awesome. I had the chilaquiles  and my husband had several tacos. The spice profile is perfect. It's like food my mother would make but better.\n\nI plan on returning many times. This is now my Mexican food place to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a tad pricey. They are stingy with their guac. The tacos Are quite small as well... But great food.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a perfect spot for a weekend afternoon to go with friends or solo and sit at the bar. The atmosphere is just right for any type of occasion really and they have plenty of outdoor space.  I had only been to this part of Gilbert at night and was carving some shrimp tacos and I must say I'm glad that I decided to check this place out. It was a little busy but they have amazing deals , I had a small pitcher of IPA for $5. Bartender told me they have great happy hour deals Monday - Friday!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place for happy hour. Plenty of options for $2 tacos and killer margaritas for $5. Highly recommend the street corn, which was awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been coming here for almost 2 years. Keeps going downhill on service. They now charge for chips and salsa. Sort of seems like a hipster spot as of recent. The taco Tuesday and 2pm specials seem to always change depending on what server you have. Think this is our last time coming here which sucks cause it was our lunch spot for a while. Referring to the Gilbert location. The last 6 visits have gotten worse and worse in service. There's a taco shop across the street we're going to try. \n\nJust gave this place another try. Worse service than last time. No refills. Only offered one margarita then given the check. Food was decent at best. Asked to speak to a manager and he came over, looked about 16 years old and didn't seem to care that we had bad service the first time, tried it again, had even worse service. He said he'll try to do better and that was it. Very disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe just had lunch here and had a wonderful experience. The food was delicious and the staff very friendly and helpful. Gabby was our waitress and she was very knowledgeable of the food and beer. She made our day by being cheerful and so easy to interact with. We will be back again soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove them.  But now charging  $1.00 salsa and $2.00 for chips refills on a $50.00 tab for 3 people for food and drink! Seriously?\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyrides was delicious, I got the tacos and they were great. But this place is very overpriced. The atmosphere was sweet and I had a great waitress! She has blue hair shout out to you!  good food just to expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was awesome! Exceeded my expectations! I had 3 tacos and wish I would have tried the fish taco but figured the 3 would have been plenty. Plus going on $2 Taco Tuesday night even topped my first visit here!  I also tried some of the nachos that my friend ordered and it was very yummy, as well as the 3 tacos that I ordered. The chips and salsa were also great! The waitress was very welcoming and the service was above and beyond! At the end of our meal my friends and I were debating getting dessert, and the waitress paid for our dessert since it was our first time there, how awesome! I will definitely be going back!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food.  We have been a couple times with our toddler and she loves the rice and little chicken tacos.  Service could be better at host station.  One of them tried to push past my little one and I and didn't say excuse me.  Nearly bumped into us.  No manners.  Hipster waitresses were ok.  Pretty much what I expect from them.  Looking cool but not great at pretending they care that we have a good experience.  Still, the food is really good so we will be back again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really wanted to like this place, but I was disappointed after the first sip of the \"almond horchata\". The atmosphere is trendy and cool, but the food is a tad over priced and isn't worth the hype. My drink was literally hard to swallow- it was very powdery and chalky. Totally not worth the $8! I ordered the crispy fish taco which had no flavor, the braised beef taco was flavorful but the cochinita pibil made me give this rating an extra star. It was delicious! Also the salsa is very fresh and had the perfect amount of heat. The tacos are small so I feel like paying almost $4 for one is a rip off! I'm glad that I tried it but probably won't be going back. The fresh salsa and cochinita pibil tacos really are the reason for the 3 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place for Taco Tuesday! They always have a rear selection of beer on tap as well. Their margaritas are also very pleasing with some chicken tacos!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe horchata and Frangelico with the Mexican street corn, chips and salsa were amazing. We tried three tacos - crispy fish, beef and ahi tuna; and a shredded beef burrito - all were tasty! Jessica and Andrew provided out of this world service! Ended the evening with Mo's special and while a little \"liquified\", special it was! Thank you Joyride for the treat of an evening out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing place!!\nSmoked sweet corn - this is my first try for a sweet corn. Topped with 3 kinds of cheese and paprika. Totally loved it. Worth a try.\n\nVeggie tacos - most delicious tacos I have had after velvet tacos in Dallas. Week days deals are the best - $2 tacos.\n\nMargaritas - bang for the buck.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease bring back your yummy cocktails like the Key Largo and Naked n Famous! These were our favorites!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place!! The staff was friendly and accommodating. We kept chasing the shade and they accommodated. The tacos were off the chain- Delish! Carne Asada, fish, carnitas, it's all great! \nI plan to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFavorite little place to eat in downtown Gilbert (as of right now!). I haven't tried all the restaurants but we love the tacos and burritos here! The chips and salsa are complimentary and the margaritas are great! They also do $2 taco Tuesdays! Yum!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe owners of Postino, Windsor, and Federal Pizza have done it again!  The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the ambiance and decor were adorable, colorful, whimsical, comfortable, and stylish with a hint of sophistication. \n\nFavorites menu items include the Street Corn, the Short Rib Taco, the Baja Fish Taco, Minerva's Mix Tape salad (so refreshing and bright), and the Banana Pudding (the crust in the bottom is SO TASTY).  I also had the Bandit, which was kind of like a tamale plate.  Didn't think this was particularly unusual, but I loved their marinated pork - so good. \n\nThis Mexican/Latin based food restaurant even has delicious agua frescas (with or without alcohol) and its own version of a Moscow Mule called the Mazatlan Mule, made with tequila and passion fruit puree. DELICIOUS!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went twice and had okay-poor experiences both times and haven't been back.  Both times the hostesses seemed generally uninterested and couldn't even manage a smile.  Both times the service at the bar was slow, I get it when the bar is busy but you have to acknowledge a customer when they arrive at the bar; ie, \"I see you, I'll be right with you\".  The food was okay, the fish and shrimp tacos were good, the chicken tacos had no flavor and everything is pretty pricey for what you get.  I did not like their signature drinks (maybe it's just my taste) they were very sweet and had the consistency of pured fruit.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing Tacos. Everything is amazing the food, the atmosphere and the staff. The margaritas selection is huge and flavorful. The tacos are perfect everything you want in a taco. Chicken tinga and pork adobada is the best 2 there!!! I will be coming back before I leave Arizona. I love this place $-$$\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time trying this place out the other night. We went with a large group to try out some Mexican food. \n\nThe service was very good. The group was taken care of very well. Our glasses were always full and they came around a lot to check in on us. \n\nThe food was also very good. I tried the carne asada, crispy fish, chicken Tiga, and Mexican rice. My favorite taco was the carne asada. The other two were good, but this one beat the others out. \n\nSome other people in our group tried the nachos (which were huge), chicken bowls, and burritos. I heard from them all that it was a pretty great place. \n\nIs it authentic Mexican food? Probably not. None the less, it was very good food. We will be back again!\n\n\n\n\n\nWonderful trendy place!  Food is sooooo fresh and so good tasting!  Highly recommend for lunch or dinner!\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely go here if you have a love for tacos! We got THE BEST service ever. Our waiter was top notch! The food was incredible and a lot of variety for a taco place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an awesome fun place with food you love to eat and come back to.   Our server Jackie was a Rock star!\n\n\n\n\n\nFun place, California atmosphere good food. The corn on the cob is excellent, the black beans are excellent. Tacos are very good with good selection. Highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\npros: almond horchata was good, as was the strawberry agua fresca, nice atmosphere with indoor/outdoor seating. free chips/salsa, manager stopped by to check up, carne asada was the best of the 3 I tried.\n\ncons: tacos were small, one very sloppy/greasy, didn't like the flavor of the adobado one, waitress seemed snobby\n\n\n\n\n\nA good place to eat and drink. Love the decor and the vibe. The tacos are pretty tasty and the drinks are all on happy hour price before 5!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place does have a nice atmosphere, but the fish tacos were average.  This is a nice place to grab a drink while waiting for a table at Postinos next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nTried this place for the first time tonight.  I love that they are open late, serve coke products,  have a fun atmosphere and decor and the service was great.  \n\nOur server suggested the nachos as an appetizer... which was absolutely terrific.  For dinner,  we took his suggestion and ordered the taco sampler plate, which had rice ans beans with carne asada, carnitas and Chicken.  I have to say my favorite was the carnitas,  I will for sure order that or the carne adada next time.  \n\nI also ordered the corn, omg this was delish.... something really worth ordering.  \n\nWe will for sure be visiting this place again,  a new favorite.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is delicious and fun. A bit overpriced, but the lunch specials are great. I enjoy the two taco and salad special. Keep in mind their happy hour ends at 5\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing right down the street, Joyride is a great place to go for a quick, delicious lunch.  First time I went, i was pleasantly surprised at the authenticity of the food.  The carne asada tacos were cooked perfectly, had great flavor, as did the pork carnitas.\n\nTheir salsa is good...a little mild--ask for the hot, you'll love it.  Only thing I would recommend is dialing down the music a bit as it's a little loud if you're talking biz.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite washed tacos & Mexican corn. Very bland. The crispy fish wasn't crispy and all of their tacos had no real flavor.\nThe horchata was legit.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove it! I can't say one negative thing about this place. Delicious food, great menu selection, fantastic service, nice ambience, good prices and yummy Aguas frescas. I recommend the strawberry with vodka! You won't be disappointed. I could eat here every week and not get tired of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally good! Shrimp tacos are great but really pricey... Highly recommend going during happy hour. Other wise your paying a lot for a little bit of food.\n\nUPDATING MY REVIEW:\n\nWe have gone back a couple of times since this review and me and my husband really enjoy sitting up at the bar, watching a game and munching on that delicious bowl of chips and salsa.  The staff is super friendly and is starting to become one of our favorites downtown. But still we try to only go at happy hour, otherwise its really pricey.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is incredible. The salsa that was served with the chips was actually spicy, which I have never experienced at any Mexican restaurant ever before. I ordered a Raspberry-Ancho margarita and the veggie enchiladas, both of which were absolutely delicious. I tried some of the carne asada from my friends beast burrito and enjoyed that as well. I wish there was one of these in California - favorite food spot in AZ so far!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great dinner! First, let me start with the salsa and chips, which is the first thing they bring you. Nice heat, little sweetness and acidity. Really some good salsa. Actually, I was a little bummed I didn't try it before getting appetizers since I would have tried some of the others.\n\nFor apps we had the shrimp ceviche and mas queso. LOVED the ceviche. It was so stinking good. Little jicama in there with a pico type mix. The queso was good. I'm not a huge cheese fan but my husband really liked it. \n\nEntrees, I had 3 tacos from the happy hour menu. Totally suggest doing that since they are $2 each. Ordered the traditional, pork adoba and carne asada. There was a mix up and I got the fish instead of the traditional but that was fine with me since I was debating that one. Fish and carne were fantastic. Adoba wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was okay but not near as good as the other two. Husband had a burrito with eggs and beef in it. Name escapes me but he really like it.\n\nOver all, awesome meal. Best of all, whole thing cost us $33. Can't really beat a nice meal out for that price.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've heard so many good things about Joyride that I was super excited when the opportunity came up to try it out. I had very high expectations. I guess it goes to show, that time & time again, when expectations are high, they are hardly ever met.\n\nMy comments about the service are very positive .. No complaints at all. When we walked into the restaurant, there were quite a few tables open & the hostess let us pick where we sat. The establishment isn't that large, but it was kind nonetheless for her to offer us the option. In general, we noticed they are really quick about bringing chips & salsa to the table as they do it as soon as all patrons are seated. They are good at keeping water glasses filled, making sure any questions are answered about the menu, orders are put in right away, etc.\n\nMy comments about the food are not so positive. I opted to get three tacos (comes with a free side when you get 3) - the shrimp taco, the crispy fish taco, & the chicken tinga taco (the second two per recommendation of our waitress). None of them blew me away .. Nor were they even that good to mention to someone. The chicken tinga was just spicy, which I am ok with, but lacked flavor. The shrimp was the same way. I would say of the three, the crispy fish was the best, but again, nothing to rave about, & almost too heavy with the added stuff on top. I got the black beans as my side ... My mistake. They just tasted like beans out of a can topped with a little bit of cheese. No seasoning. I didn't understand nor enjoy them. My dining-mate got the veggie burrito & it was really good. For how much he paid, he enjoyed it & more.\n\nLastly, it's to be noted that there are a ton of flies in the restaurant. It was not only annoying, but also felt un-sanitary. I almost wanted to leave before we even ordered, but decided to stick around. I guess I should've gone with my original gut instinct!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe enjoy the experience of eating at Joy Ride; the vibe and decorations are amazing! However, it's a little pricey and the food always seemed rushed even though the wait for a seat and your food is quite long. When we go we always set aside all night because we know we'll be waiting a long time, but it's to be expected in such a trendy area! We LOVE downtown Gilbert!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service, waiters, hosts - poor to mediocre food. Got a real, real cold \"chicken\" taco which was essentially a skinless chicken tender for way too much money.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe give all 5s. Our server tori and the manager on tonight Billy were AMAZING! Little mix up with happy hour advertisement. But Billy hooked us up anyways! The customer service was something that should be in every restaurant like it is at joyride! We will be back as long as the service doea not change!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a hotspot for hipsters.  I went there a year ago on a date because she was a big fan of Mexican food, as am I.  She ordered a burrito and I got three tacos: 2 fish and 1 carne asada.  We also got the almond horchata.  \n\nThe food was incredibly forgettable.  It wasn't spicy or flavorful in any way.  The presentation was great but who cares if the food is bland.  We were both very disappointed in the food as well as the horchata.  I got the feeling that this place was so busy creating a hipster-friendly environment that they forgot to worry about their food.  \n\nOverall, the place had a cool look, friendly service, and the prices weren't terrible but I'm never going back simply because the food was not that good.  I'll be hitting up Joe's BBQ across the street if I'm ever in the neighborhood again.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a delicious and cool vibe! The vegetarian tacos and burrito were filling. We had the Mexican corn and it was so tasty topped with spices and cheese. I highly recommend that! \n\nGreat service as well! Our waiter was personal and helpful. \n\nThe bathrooms are so cool and clean.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was here on a short trip and my friend took me and my mom here to eat. I really like tacos and being in the southwest, I expected great things. \n\nI was kind of hungry, so I decided to try the beast burrito and my mom got some fish tacos. The burrito was good, but it just wasn't what I was expecting, like something was off. Maybe it was that it didn't taste as authentic to me. The tacos also weren't bad, but again, something was off to me. I thought it was slightly overpriced for what we got, since I was expecting more, but I wouldn't mind trying this place again given the right conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow... Just had the worst experience EVER at an Upward project establishment... We were seated promptly and the hostess was very inviting. Here's where we went wrong (apparently), the bartenders started off attentive, but that was short lived. Once our food arrive not once did either of them check on us. The busser/or server did, not the bartenders. They were so wrapped up in cleaning/side work  we didn't get to order our second round of drinks, ask for more guacamole or even get our check in a timely fashion. We actually waited 20 mins to ask some one if we could pay. Then another 10 mins for them to actually bring us the correct tab. I've been here numerous times! Truly disappointed....\n\nOn a good note, the food is always good.\n\nWe left and went next door to postinos to finish our meal. Had a great experience there....\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber one happy hour spot in Gilbert, no contest!  There are quite a few drink choices on sale as well as tacos.  We loved the assortment of salsas available as well.  This is a great place to go on a spring day when they have the huge windows open.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is very good. The atmosphere is perfect. It is nice, but not stuffy, and very relaxed comfortable place. I was most impressed with how kid friendly they were. Our kids food came on kid friendly plates - nice hard plastic red ones. I have never seen this before at restaurant. The kids food was also very good. Sometimes when you order kid menu items, you can tell they are frozen, or no effort is put into it. Not here. They made their kid food with the same quality as the adult food. This is the part that impressed me most. Our adult food was also amazing. We will be returning customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride's Gilbert location started out strong on the burgeoning downtown Gilbert Main Street as one of the best places for trendy Mexicana in the east valley. My first experience there was phenomenal as I was given the full rundown of the menu and even a sample of some of their newer tacos. Since then, it has become a regular spot for myself and my Gilbert dwelling friends to enjoy an afternoon repast of beer and fish tacos. The atmosphere is great, the wait staff is friendly and attractive, and the music they play never disappoints. \n\nI give four stars rather than five however, because over the last year or so, some of their recipes have undergone some changes. To this day there are a few dishes that remain inconstant, and some of my personal favorites like their pulled pork torta have been removed altogether. \n\nDon't fix what ain't broke, joyride!\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbiance: It was Sunday afternoon. We had about 20 min. wait so they texted us when the table was ready (better than having to wait outside or carry a buzzer). There were 2 trans-gender bathrooms & 1 women's bathroom. The bar was pretty full with people drinking cocktails in the middle of the afternoon. There were 2 flat screen TVs hanging in the bar area, one showing golf & the other showing baseball. The sound level was pretty noisy due to the number of customers in the dining room. It was very bright due to the sun shining in through all the windows. There was outdoor seating & a fireplace for cooler weather.  \nFood: Great chicken burritos if you like mushroom & mango. Finding a piece of chicken was like finding a needle in a haystack. \nThe complimentary salsa on the table was too hot so we had to pay $2 for a small bowl of pico de gallo which arrived warm (much to my husband's chagrin). \nThe complimentary chips were the best thing I had. They were thin & salty.\nThere was complimentary cold water on the table for us which was great since it was very hot outside.\nThe carne asada taco with cilantro & cabbage had a spicy sauce that made it inedible for me, after one bite I was drinking my water trying to rescue my tongue. I ended up having to give it to my husband who said it was great.\nMy daughters split a chicken burrito which we specified they only wanted chicken. However, it is either cooked in a spicy sauce or they added something spicy because one of my daughters couldn't eat it. \nCheese was non-existent in any of our meals. \nWaitstaff: The waitstaff was attentive & happily explained the menu since we told them it was our first visit. \nPrices: $3.50 for a street taco served with a flour tortilla. $10.50 for a quesailla. $8.00 for a chicken burrito. They have taco Tuesday with $2 tacos & margaritas are $5 before 5pm.\nOverall, I would say it is not a place to go if you don't enjoy spicy food.\n\n\n\n\n\nGame changer.\n\nGilbert has long awaited a place as cool and classy as this. Extremely well crafted cocktails, imaginative desserts, and delicious food. Despite the stress of a brand new restaurant immediately flooded by 100's of customers, Joyride held up extremely well. \n\nDrinks were served in regular fashion. Mike, the bartender, and Chris, also a bartender, served Mazaltan Mules with short delay. What ever wait we had, the taste, texture, and payload of the drink more than made up for it. We also tried the Agua Fresca's.... yum. Fruity with a kick.\n\nI am delighted. \n\nLauren, the manager of Joyride, was on point without being in the face of her staff. She genuinely cares about her restaurant. I know sometimes new places get a bad rap here on yelp when they begin as they work out the bumps. I urge you to speak with her prior to giving anything less than a 4. She's pretty real. \n\n\nThank you, Joyride. Thank you. I will be back... lots.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of our \"go to\" places for a good quick meal...or even a longer one with friends.   Great food, great service, laid back eclectic crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were seated promptly.\nThe menu was simple and easy to read.\nPrices ... Some were slightly pricey.\nWe liked the ambience. Retro fun! ^_^\nService was prompt, and those who helped us seemed knowledgeable of their offerings.\n\nWe ordered tacos and chimis. Oh and salad as well. We liked the fact that it's not processed. However, it seems to lack flavour. It's either salty, spicey, or tangy. \n\nTheir chips were yummy, and like the fact that Darth Vader kept us company! Lol\n\nGive this spot a go! ^_^\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is not to Rant & Rave about this place? You have got to try it! So last night the Lady and I decided to try this place. We tried to make the Happy Hour but just missed it by about 20 minutes (FYI, HH is all day until 5pm). Not so bummed b/c the prices were reasonable especially when you factor the OUTSTANDING service and the fresh ingredients. Made to Order corn tortillas for your tacos! It won't get any fresher unless you grind the corn at your table. We had the fish tacos...unbelievable! We usually rate a place by their nachos but already have a new Fav place. Its a mix of people who dine in there retro-ish looking place, low music (which is nice for conversation). Can't wait to go back and try other items like their nachos, aqua fresca and melt your face salsa! See you there\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple varieties of tacos, carne and standard chicken are the best. Their happy hour is great and the drinks are even better. Service is fast and friendly. nice outside seating as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride never disappoints! I always get The Standard tacos, but I've had pretty much everything here and it's all delicious. You could order anything on the menu and end up a happy camper.\n\nThe atmosphere is super chill and bright. It's definitely a tight squeeze, but I've never felt claustrophobic or squished. It's like a cozy little family in there! The patio/outdoor eating area is beautiful during the winter months and is a great hot spot during Happy Hour.\n\nPro tip - I (obviously) recommend The Standard. Plus, if you buy 3 tacos, you get a free side-dish, which I love. Their Blood Orange Mule is pretty awesome too!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guacamole is fantastic.  My wife and I can ride our bikes there.  Occasionally they have a special that if you ride your bike you get free tacos on your next vist.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen my friend invited me to the Hale theater I asked her if she wanted to indulge in some light bites before the show and she agreed. Not sure what was over there since I live clear over on the other side of town I told her to pick. Amongst the list of fantastic new eateries right at the theater was Joyride.\n\n Not the biggest fan of Tex- Mex food it takes a lot to get me to want to try Mexican. I have only about three favorites and constant Mexican eateries I will go to in town and they are more of a traditional Mexican. With that said, I had heard how great this place was so I wanted to give it a try. The verdict? Thumbs up! They have a great Happy Hour, good Guac, and tasty street tacos. ( And cheap!) My Raspberry Ancho Marg drink was tasty and again, cheap! \n\nThe place was packed though. On the way out and I got spilled on twice. Pretty tight quarters for sure if you sit inside. I guess that is part of the fun. I had a shoe that smelled like beer all evening. Oh yeah, the servers were all very nice. The food was delivered fast with a group concept. I like group concept restaurants. I'd go back. However, maybe  to the phoenix location closer to my hood.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad lunch here with a couple of friends. The overall ascetics of the place was inviting. Service was good and food was okay nothing spectacular. For what you got and the quality of food I thought it was a tad over priced.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place that fits right in with downtown Gilbert. \n\nFirst off, I love the feel of the building. Makes you feel your in California next to the beach.  The place is very clean with a modern/hipster feel.   That have a decent beer selection and their personal pitchers is the way to go!! Hands down. You tell me personal and beer pitcher in the same sentence and I'm sold. You had me at hello!! \n\nNow for the tacos!! Some say they are small and they can be a bit pricey, but these pack a lot of flavor and and order of 3 will more then get the job done.  I love how they let you mix n match. I love the chicken, barbacoa, and the steak. Can't go wrong. \n\nBut for all the love of tacos do not skimp on the sides. The Mexican corn is out of this world delicious and the black beans are legit!!  \n\nI came more often when I lived in the area, but still try and find time to find my way back as often as I can.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been to this location of Joyride a couple times now.\n\nIt is super cute and I love the decor.  \n\nCurrently there is construction next door for a new breakfast place, so there is no more \"play area\" outdoors to chillax.  Still, they have tables outside.  I was seated there on my most recent visit.\n\nI love their chips and salsa and could eat it all day long.\n\nI've ordered a few different entrees and tacos from Joyride.  They were all pretty good.  On the most recent visit, I ordered a Garden Variety veggie burrito ($8)  sans the white magic (as it contains egg).  It was actually really good.  \n\nHowever, I have to say that the food is inconsistent in that the entrees have all been pretty good, but the sides and soup are just plain boring.\n\nI ordered the pinto beans on my last visit ($3) and ate two bites of the dish.  They seemed to lack any flavor and could have used, at the very least, some salt and pepper.  On a previous visit I ordered a bowl of the tortilla soup ($6).  It tasted like chicken noodle, at best.  It was not good and I sent it back (which I never do).  My dining companion ordered a side of \"The Bomb black beans\" and he only ate a few bites, when he normally inhales them.  I noticed a guy at a table in front of us ordered the side of rice.  I observed the guy ate one bite and left the rice untouched after that. \n\nMy daughter ordered the kid's meal nachos, which had some sort of fondue-like melted cheese on top.  The chips looked good, but she had fewer than ten nachos on her plate.  It came with milk and a side of some cut up fruit.  The tray had a place for another side and I think it should have had beans or something in addition for the $5 they charge.  Still, it would have been fine if my daughter would have eaten all the nachos. Unfortunately, we were seated under a tree and leaves kept falling into her food.  She refused to eat the food, even after I removed the leaves.  Unfortunately, we did not see our waitress often and it was too inconvenient to be moved at that point.  I would  ask to be reseated if the tree still had leaves (on a subsequent visit).  \n\nIf Joyride had more \"zippy\" or exciting sides, they'd have a loyal customer.  It's too darn bad they can't get better beans going.  I am still thinking about how good the veggie burrito is, but I won't be back unless someone else drags me.\n\n\n\n\n\nChill atmosphere, cold beer, tasty tacos. \"The Standard\" is my personal favorite. And the rice..... be sure to get the rice!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is one of my favorite restaurants. I go regularly and always have a great experience with both the food and the service. I love the lunch special: 2 delicious tacos and a wonderful salad for less than $10.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for a great happy hour and great food I would recommend joyride! On to too it off the service is amazing! I will defiantly be coming back here!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food! I ordered a variety of tacos - grilled fish, carne asada, and carnitas. All of them were very flavorful, but the carne asada was AMAZING. Their pico de gallo was mild in heat, but delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place! The best tacos in town. We have been coming here every week for the last year, and the service is always great and the food and drinks are even better! Tori has been the best server we have had, and we love coming in to see her. Trust me we will come back for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat spot in downtown gilbert.\n\nI always sit outside. \n\nI like their burritos. \n\nGreat chips and salsa and they keep them coming which is how it should be.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for the first time on a Saturday night.  We had a large party and they were able to accommodate us quite quickly.  Everyone said their meal was delicious!  I had the ceviche which barely had any avocado in it.  The server was nice enough to get me a little extra.  My only complaint was that the drinks were overpriced.  9.75 for a margarita and 9 for a 5 oz glass of wine.  Those kind of prices you need to be using top shelf liquor and 9 oz wine pours.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place! My friends and I bike here almost every weekend. The staff is amazing and the food is great. Not much else to say but we'll be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely the best Tacos I've had in years!!! We enjoyed sitting outside for lunch in downtown Gilbert where you can find many new eateries that are also very, very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were so excited to try this place but it did not met the hype. The food was mediocre, my tacos lacked flavor and tasted a little dry. We did get our kids \"kids meals\" which weren't bad and priced reasonably but they were small portions and not enough to fill up my 9 year. More suitable for under 5 years old. \n\nThe one thing I really did like was the Horchata. It was amazing. One of the best i have had. Unfortunately, no free refills and half the cups was filled with ice. \n\nThe service was mediocre as well. They actually forgot my husbands meal and they had to rush order it. They did offer us complimentary churros as an apology. The churros weren't bad. A little crunchy but the chocolate dipping sauce made them taste better. \n\nOverall, i don't see us going back. Save your money there are better taco shops out there.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have eaten here several times and from what I've seen, the experience at Joyride is consistent. So the positives are the atmosphere, service, and drinks. Whoever designed this place did a really great job at creating a hipster environment that is also really comfortable. There is a great outdoor seating area and all of the design choices are happy and pleasant. Service has also always been friendly and efficient. The other major upside is the drinks, which are well made, creative, and delicious. They have a nice nonalcoholic selection as well. \n\nThe major downfall at Joyride is unfortunately the food. It isn't awful, but it's just not very good. I have had a variety of tacos, the torta, and some forgettable huevos rancheros type thing and none of it has been any good. I mean, it's edible, but it just falls so flat in flavor. Pretty much everything needs more salt and spice. Even the salsas are really quite bland. \n\nIf they improved the food situation, this place would be five stars, no question. As it is though, I'd stick with drinks and eat at any one of the other more delicious choices within walking distance of Joyride.\n\n\n\n\n\nI should start by saying that I'm a native Arizona girl born and raised on authentic mexican food. Epic joints like El Ray, Casa Reynoso, and La Casita are my favs...Globe/Miami kind of mexican food. So, in comparison to what I'm used to I had to give Joyride 3 stars. \n\nThe parking in downtown Gilbert sucks and that's where Joyride is located...parking is a real negative. The decor is bright and awesome! Very hipster type decor. I loved the Star Wars art and the really cool chairs. The seating is indoor/outdoor so there was an issue with flies at our table. This definitely took away from the experience. My son was grossed out for sure.\n\nThe customer services was great, really nice people and prompt service. Without asking the waitress brought out water for my toddler with a lid so that was nice. \n\nChips and salsa are served free as an app, it's okay I guess, kind of a smokey/Chipotle type salsa flavor...not really my style. I ordered some tacos, they were okay, more upscale American infused, fancy pants style. My husband has a more refined palate and he enjoyed his dish. He got the The Beast burrito. It had a smokey fresh grilled flavor, pretty good if you're into that. The execution of the dish was stellar, you can tell they have some pros in the kitchen. The guacamole seems to be fresh and it's good. The jalapeos on top are a perfect heat, not too hot. The plating of the dishes was very nice and professional. \n\nBottom line: if you enjoy eating more of an upscale American style Mexican food, this is a place for you. If you have a simple palate, like mine, and were raised on authentic mexican food, you may be disappointed. Service is great, environment is neat, colorful, hipster. I didn't have a drink, but the bar looks cool. It would be a nice place to kick back a few with some girlfriends on a Friday night. If you want to check it out I would go early. We went here before dinner rush with no waiting. I had a friend who tried to stop in and there was over and hour wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe family decided to have dinner at Joyride Taco House on a Sunday evening.  We arrived at about 6:00pm, and we were promptly seated indoors.  Since there were only a few available tables when we arrived, we didn't end up having the best seating.  Our table was cramped for four people, and we were tucked away in a corner without much of a view   Overall, the restaurant is somewhat cozy inside with a modern decor and a bit of a hipster vibe.  There are also a few outdoor dining areas, but on this day with temperatures exceeding 110, there wasn't anyone sitting outside.  Overall ambiance - 3/5.\n\nIn terms of the food, we had the complementary chips and salsa as an appetizer.  Then I ordered 3 tacos - the Crispy Fish, Chicken Tinga, and the Carne Asado along with the Mexican veggies for the side.  The tacos were excellent with the Crispy Fish being my favorite followed by the Carne Asado, and the Chicken Tinga was a distant third.  The veggies were excellent and consisted of roasted corn and peppers with some added greens.  Overall food - 4.5/5.\n\nPaige was our server and she really took care of our table.  She had a very warm personality and took the time to answer our questions.  She checked-in on us at appropriate intervals and made sure water and ice was refilled without having to be asked to do so.  Overall service - 4.5/5.\n\nWe enjoyed our dining experience at JTH, and we would be interested in dining here again.  Next time I'd like to try Happy Hour or Taco Tuesdays where most varieties of tacos on sale for $2 each as well as drink specials.  This is a good deal that can't be missed.\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess it's never too late to say thank you, and I want to give a big shout-out to Joyride.  Even though they were closing at 4:00 p.m. Christmas Eve, they let my group of 15 adults and kids come in at 3:00.  The seven young grandkids sat at a table near us, and the manager took the time to learn their names so she could ask each what they wanted to order. This made them feel special.  She even treated us and the kids to a free guacamole appetizer! \n\nThe food was delicious, as always.  Good variety of well-stuffed tacos.  I made sure everyone ordered the Mexican corn (off the cob), and not one kernel was left.  Our server had a fun sense of humor and paid the right amount of attention to us.  So, thank you, Joyride, for making our Christmas Eve fun -- and saving me from having to cook for everyone!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here on Sunday for the first time. Service was horrible. Very over priced and average at best food. The restaurant was not very busy but the service was painfully slow.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave been regularly coming back! Good modern Mexican food and good service. The enchiladas, tacos, and street corn are favorites. Also, Taco Tuesday is a great deal for trying new flavors. Usually a wait for the food, but worth it!\n\n\n\n\n\nGame changer.\n\nGilbert has long awaited a place as cool and classy as this. Extremely well crafted cocktails, imaginative desserts, and delicious food. Despite the stress of a brand new restaurant immediately flooded by 100's of customers, Joyride held up extremely well. \n\nDrinks were served in regular fashion. Mike, the bartender, and Chris, also a bartender, served Mazaltan Mules with short delay. What ever wait we had, the taste, texture, and payload of the drink more than made up for it. We also tried the Agua Fresca's.... yum. Fruity with a kick.\n\nI am delighted. \n\nLauren, the manager of Joyride, was on point without being in the face of her staff. She genuinely cares about her restaurant. I know sometimes new places get a bad rap here on yelp when they begin as they work out the bumps. I urge you to speak with her prior to giving anything less than a 4. She's pretty real. \n\nThank you, Joyride. Thank you. I will be back... lots.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust went to Joyride with the man friend ;) and we had an AMAZING time. What they have in limited menu selections they make up for in extreme flavor and unexpected flavors (can you say roasted pumpkin seeds??). Their alcohol menu is great with the addition of the agua frescas and their full bar. Billy is an AMAZING server; her \"Indian Jones\" hat was very \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and not \"Temple of Doom\". She was very knowledgable about the menu and made our experience great. Hey manager- keep her in mind! You've got a great one on your hands! \n\nThank you, Joyride! We'll definitely be back, hoping to see Billy and her fun attitude and fashion trends. We love you!\n\n-Melissa\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to try: Cucumber Serrano cocktail, crispy fish taco, chicken burrito with the veggie medley, veggie taco (weird, I know), and the beet salad! Awesome lunch special: 3 tacos and half salad under $10. $5 cocktails every day until 5pm.\n\nThe one pitfall: although the complimentary salsa is decent it lacks spice. I like spicy and I think it's ridiculous I have to pay extra to kick it up a notch at a Mexican restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our 1st time here. Wer family of 5. Everything is good , tacos r so good. N services is 5 star no doubt, but only thing i have complained is d price of Shrimp Ceviche is xpensive for that lil bowl itself. Oh well not gonna order that again for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere food is probably a three, they have taco Tuesday which is nice, with two dollar tacos, however they charge for there chips and salsa something they previously hadn't done in the past. Paying two dollars to get some extra chips and salsa when historically they were free is unacceptable. Especially when there food is nothing special to get you through the door.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll keep this short and sweet. Came here expecting nothing great. The inside was very hipster and they had good music. The service was really good but it could be because they weren't too busy yet and they were only open for an hour and it was still early. Our server immediately brought out chips and salsa for us to snack on and the salsa was delicious! Well seasoned and really refreshing. I ordered the short rib, crispy fish, and carnitas tacos and wow were they delicious! The crispy fish and short rib tacos were really good but the carnitas wasn't all that great. There was a lot of meat in the short rib taco and the crispy fish was a nice size and had a great crunch. My boyfriend had a carne asada burrito called \"the beast\" and wow was that amazing too! The meat was tender and well flavored and the meat had a charred grill flavor to them which made the burrito super delicious! We had their mexican 75 cocktail and almond horchata with armaretto and those were delicious too! the drinks are on happy hour all day till 5pm and they were only $5. Overall experience was great and we'll definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time visit today...wow, that was fricken' awesome!\nI figured it would be busy @1pm on a Sat....holiday weekend and all. It was but they have quite alot of seating in/out. The staff was friendly and I saw lots of hustle going on. I had the fish & standard tacos. These are street sized so 3 is a meal and for $1 you can get a side. I didn't do that because I joind the Eposse and received a free appetizer! I had the guacamole which was fresh and tasty with alittle jalapeno kick, excellent.\nMy tacos we also excellent with fresh ingredients and big flavor. If you find yourself in need of a taco fix I recommend Joyride.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a gem. I took a friend here for a little birthday celebration and we had a great time! Staff here is so friendly and sweet and I don't know how they could improve. Just super! It was Taco Tuesday and all were pretty good. They have their own twist on fresh Mexican cuisine. Their Margaritas were killer. One in particular stood way out. It is the Cucumber. Fresh, smokey, and balanced. Just great. Will be back to try more of menu. Churros were delish too. Nice vibe. Demographics were across the board which makes for excellent people perch spot too. Will be back. \nUPDATE:  The food is inconsistent.  Went back on Friday and the steak burrito was grisly and bland. They swapped for a chicken and that was bland and sparse meat...all for 12 bucks...drink here, but food needs help.\n\n\n\n\n\nI heard all of the hype about this restaurant so I tried going there with my friends 2 times now.  Both times we had great service. 5-stars in that section, very nice and attentive. The -2 stars are for the pricing vs. the quantity for food. You can easily rack your bill up here for some of the most standard dishes. Food itself is good. Drinks are good. But I cannot believe how much the menu items are. The wow-factor was not there for me unfortunately.  However, it is worth trying once if you're looking to splurge on a night out.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would rate the nachos here about 3.5-4.0 stars.  Nice flavor and homemade nacho chips are awesome!!  Steak is decent.\n\nThe baja fish taco was inedible.  I ended eating all the toppings like the guacamole and left the fish alone.  I just tasted so off, I couldn't eat it.\n\nComplimentary salsa sucks.  But once again the chips are good.\n\nThe $5 tropicale margarita was horrid.  I had to return it after one tiny sip.  I just can't stand cheap quality drinks.\n\nService was great.  Staff was very nice.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy experience here was nothing special. Let's start with the good.\n\nPros\n-Amazing atmosphere \n-Great Margaritas \n-Great Location\n-Outdoor seating\n-Fresh air inside as well\n-Awesome tacos\n-Amazing Happy Hour specials \n\nCons\n-Poor Service by some\n\nUpon arriving, my girlfriend and I were warmly welcomed and sat promptly during what seemed to be a busy time.  They host sat us in a wonderful spot in the restaurant and was very kind. \n\nA young lady who was walking around filling water and occasional light busing table came by to fill our water glasses during this process she spilled more than an acceptable amount of water on our table and walked looked at us and walked away without speaking, apologizing and/or wiping up the spilled water. Them seemed odd as I'm sure I am not the only person who enjoys eating at a dry table.  None the less I waited to see if she was coming back to clean up and noticed that she wasn't  I went ahead and unrolled my silverware and cleaned up the table myself.  \n\nOur waiter arrived and and kindly took our drink order, he was a nice gentleman and returned shortly after with drinks in hand.  Before the waiter left I noticed a hair in my marg and made him aware.  He was great and apologizing and returning promptly with a new one. My girlfriend had the blood orange marg which was amazing.  I had the Joyride which I also that was great, so good that I ordered a second round. We were both very satisfied with our drinks.\n\nWe each order our Tacos, I had the Standard, The Chicken Tinga and the Crispy Fish which our server recommended.  I must say all of the tacos were amazing! Great choices and a great recommendation on behalf of the waiter. \n\nWhile eating the same young lady who was refilling water stopped by and filled our water again, this time not spilling on our table but instead as she walked away spilling on the floor right next to me causing water to splash on my leg.  At this point I am laughing out of disbelief of her carelessness and poor demeanor as she works.  She has yet to smile and/or speak.  Luckily this was our last experience with this individual. \n\nWhen the check came I was surprised to see our bill for 3 margs, and 5 tacos was so cheap. \n\nWorking in the service industry I know tips are a way of showing your appreciation for great service.  I refused to allow the hair in my marg and the careless water lady affect our service good service and left around a 30% tip after factoring in the discount given due to happy hour.  I wish I could remember his name so I could shout him out and let him know I appreciate his service.  \n\nHopefully he along with the hostess will rub off on the others in the restaurant.  Just because you aren't designated to serving others doesn't mean you are excused from working with a smile on your face and putting effort into your work.\n\nI am in no rush to comeback...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is quite a charming place in Downtown Gilbert. Great food, atmosphere, and service; what more can you ask for?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were seated quickly with water, chips, and salsa to follow. Salsa was very good and chips were ok. I had the Beast Burrito in a bowl with the tortilla on the side and it was very good. Wife had the fish taco and carne  asada taco with a half salad. All very good with excellent service.\n\n\n\n\n\ngood food staff is always friendly and great sour mix for any drink!!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place but why oh why did you get rid of the El Capitan sandwich?? It was amazing! Bring it back please!\n\n\n\n\n\nChips and salsa are good. So is cheese y mas. \nFound a hair in our chips, server and manager apologized and comped the cheese y mas.\n\nFried fish tacos were crispy, dish tasted previously frozen. Chicken tacos were the best thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent tacos and service was great! Couldn't get any better!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat service fast beautiful mister patio great tasting salsa... we came on taco tuesday 2$ tacos from 2 till close...\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent!!! Food was awesome, the atmosphere was great. Service was busy but still kept me happy :) Free chips and salsa but we then bought a different kind, the habanero (YUM!!!!) and HOT! Will be back very soon!!!! Plus, awesome happy hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nI enjoyed the ambiance and location of JoyRide Tacos Hut was very disappointed with their street tacos. WAY overpriced for \"gourmet\" tacos and the flavor and taste is rather underwhelming. I don't think we'll be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reading all of the mixed reviews, my wife and I were a bit nervous to try what appeared to be an overly hipster Mexican joint.  It's an understatement to say we were blown away!  Our server Justin was super friendly and provided stellar service. We started with the Shrimp Ceviche which had just the right amount of acidity and copious amounts of fresh plump shrimp.\n\nFor our entrees, we shared three tacos: a fried fish, a grilled shrimp, and a cochinata pibil. All were absolutely delicious, but the standouts in my opinion were the shrimp and fish, especially the fresh guacamole which added just the right amount of freshness to the fried fish.  We also split the Enselada Fila which was fresh, crispy, light, and vibrant!  Although slightly overpriced, Joyride Taco House is well worth it with its fresh ingredients and friendly service.  Lesson well learned: never judge a hipster book by its cover.\n\n\n\n\n\nShelby at Joyride was awesome! So personable and friendly! Thank you for the great service. We will be back soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went here on a Friday night for dinner. Hadnt been to downtown Gilbert in a while. \n\nThe wait was about 45 min so we sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails w/tortilla chips n salsa. Pretty good salsa! I had the mandarin Margarita first & the almond horchata w/amarreto second. The margarita was good but not memorable, I liked the horchata even better. Would get again.\n\nOnce we got seated I decided on the chilaqueles for my entre. Was my first experience with this dish. I'm happy I tried it. Lots of different textures and flavors that went went well together. From the crunch of the tostada and salsa verde, along side shredded chicken and beans as well as the sunny side up egg on top. The dish was hearty and filling. Would definitely order again. I'm hungry for it now while I'm writing this... ;)\n\nMy wife ordered the ceviche. Unfortunately I didnt try it. She really liked it and she's had ceviche in a number of places. So must be good. \n\nI saved room for desert at Peterson's ice cream & cafe down the street so we'll have to go back to Joyride to try thier sweet stuff.\n\nWe would go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaw a lot of reviews for this place and we went as a group of about 10.  I am not sure if they weren't prepared for a group or if that service was typical there.  it was a bit slow going and I took into consideration that there was a group, but it was still slow going.  I ordered two different types of tacos.  Prices are per taco. (dinners do not include rice or beans or anything else).  They are street style tacos (aka very small).   It was quite bland and small, and there were no extras.  It was just some meat and a little extra pico.  Two bites and you were done.  Don't come hungry and expect to fill up.  Even with a small appetite, two tacos will likely still not be enough.  Three tacos would be good for lunch size portion.    They charge for salsa with the tacos and nachos and extra salsa for the chips.  I did get to try the chips and salsa (very small container considered they were serving 4-6 people per bowl).  There was no spice whatsover here.  Disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the atmosphere and ambience. Surprisingly downtown Gilbert is popping. This spot in particular seems always packed. Drinks are great. The blood orange and prickly pear margaritas were great. Then for dinner we had some corn appetizer dish which was the highlight of the meal. I'd go back just for that. Dinner was a chilaquille dish and a veg enchilada with green and red sauce. It was good but not the best. I'd give this a 4.5 but I'll round it up. Bc the overall experience\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I had some errands to run in Gilbert and We drove by this place so We thought we would give it a try. Wow! We weren't disappointed. We had shrimp ceviche, chicken burrito, pork and chicken and fish tacos. Everything was on point. Delicious and fresh. We will definitely come back here again when we in the area. Wish there was the one near by where we live.\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos were very overpriced for what they were. Waitress could not have cared less we were there. Smelled. Boo.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy experience at joyride tonight was pretty disappointing. I am new to the area and had several recommend joyride to me. We were a group of 5 - 3 kids, 2 adults.  I knew that this was a busy restaurant and was not upset to have to wait about 30 min for a table, I was less happy to sit at our table for another 10 min or so before seeing our server. Our server was friendly and efficient but perhaps a little too busy, as she was pretty rushed every time she stopped at out table. \n  Our food came at strange intervals, kids food first, then our appetizer, then once the kids were pretty much finished my and my husbands meal came out. We split the 3 taco plate. 2 grilled fish tacos and one shrimp. Here's where things really went down hill. The fish smelled pretty fishy before the plate was even at the table but we thought maybe we were just being weird for some reason. Nope. The grilled fish in the tacos was definitely less than fresh and had a sour low tide kind of taste. We each took one bite and decided that it was a no go. Our server was great and took the plate right away and replaced the order with veggie tacos which came out in about 10 minutes. \n I know the restaurant did everything they could to take care of the problem but by the time we got our new tacos our kids were bouncing off the walls and ready to go. The veggie tacos were just ok, the kids food was ok at best and the wait times were a little too much for me. Not to mention, how did no one in the kitchen notice the stink of the fish?!?\n Our server did comp the taco meal and offer us free desert, which was nice but this place did not live up to my expectation at all. Sorry joyride but I think I will be getting my taco fix elsewhere from now on.\n\n\n\n\n\nI hate paying for food that isn't good. Nice vibe but that's what you're paying for! Food is just ok.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is has a nice atmosphere both inside and outside. My boys got the kids meal with the chicken tacos. They did not care for the tacos that had beans mixed in them. We ordered the standard, carne asada, and the fried fish tacos. The tacos were ok along with the Mexican cold slaw. I think I was looking for more of a Mexican taste. The food is healthy but just not for was. The place was nice to try...\n\n\n\n\n\nTrendy new place in downtown Gilbert, adjacent to the equallty trendy Postino.  Joyride has a good menu, and fresh ingredients.  The carne asada taco is excellent, as well as the fish taco.  \n\nThere area couple of reasons why I'm only giving three stars.  First, the atmosphere is trying to be very hip and trendy, which I found a bit of a turnoff.  The servers were friendly enough, but I just personally prefer a cozier ambiance, rather than feeling like I'm in downtown Scottsdale.\n\nAlso, I thought the prices were a little high.  They offer an excellent in-house salsa, but offer additional \"premium\" salsas for an additional charge.  I like trying different salsas, but found my choices to be fairly bland, and not as good as their house salsa.  The tacos are priced ok, though.\n\nJoyride is a decent restaurant, and I'd definitely try it again - but it didn't make me put it on my \"must-return\" list.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur favorite place in downtown Gilbert! Happy hour is the best, $2 tacos and $5 margaritas! The food is phenomenal and high quality. The only thing stopping me from giving a 5 star review is the service has been a little slow from time to time, but usually only when they are super busy. When it's not packed, the service staff is all friendly and helpful!\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, I get why this place is so popular. It is decorated uber-cool and has great music. Unfortunately the popularity means that we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. That would have been ok if it weren't for the fact that A - the hostess told us it would only be 15 minutes and B - she took our drink orders and my friend's credit card and then never came back and C - we saw multiple other parties that arrived after us were seated before we were. We sat outside in the lawn chairs, drinkless, until my friend went and tracked her down to find out what was going on. And even after we were moved to a table inside and greeted by Josh, our server, she still had a hard time getting the credit card back. After that we had to wait another 15-20 minutes just to be able to order.\n\nOverall, the service was pretty terrible. Apparently the owners think that 3 teenagers are enough waitstaff for the entire restaurant and bar and that plus the fact that they pool tips means that none of them really care about whether the guests have a good experience. The drinks were also hit or miss. I really enjoyed my cucumber agua fresca even though it was a little too sweet for me. But another friend got the blood orange margarita and it was awful. I am not sure if it was made wrong or what but since Josh's visits to our table were few and far between she didn't have an opportunity to send it back.\n\nSo, why 3 whole stars you ask? Well, the tacos were pretty tasty. We all got the three taco plate because with three you get the free side. The orange cucumber salad was definitely worth it. I ordered the braised beef, grilled fish, and cochinita pibil. The pork on was a little underwhelming but the other two were outstanding. The fish was cooked perfectly and I loved the flavor of the beef. Other favorites from my girlfriends were the shrimp and veggie tacos. The tacos were all pretty small so you should definitely order 2 or 3 of them. So, overall the meal ended up being about $12. Not bad. But the drinks were really overpriced so that balanced out. Overall, I was happy with the quality of the food and it would be a pretty cool place to hang out if they could improve their staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos here are really good, the drinks are really good, and the ambience is fantastic. It was about a 30 minute wait on a Friday night. I would definitely recommend and will be back probably for drinks and Tacos. The salsa on the other hand is OK but due to the fact that if you drink at the bar you get free chips and salsa is a plus.\n\n\n\n\n\nRock-star treatment for a blue-collar, not-as-nicely-dressed-as-I-should-have-been guy on a fine Wednesday afternoon.  I had been hauling and delivering and installing and making a royal mess of myself before realizing I was hungry, later than lunch is served in many places. I stopped in about 3 looking for lunch, which they said they'd happily serve me, but the happy hour is insanely tempting....and so I bit!\n\nThree tacos (veg/pork/I forget the 3rd) and a, um, sorry boss, pitcher of yummy craft beer. Very delicious food, tasty premium waves (the pitcher is $5 all day until 5pm, while a pint is $6; what are YOU going to do? ;), and the drinking water (and ice-perfect size/texture...I know, that sounds weird, but you sit there and drink water and chew the ice w/o realizing you have been doing this for 5 minutes!).  Really god job by Mr DeMarco & Company.\n\nCan't wait to go back. Like tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit:  This place was great when it first opened.  I've ordered food twice lately that was just bad.  The first time I thought it was just a bad day for them...the second time they sent me with a cold to-go order (I was there early) with zero flavor and they didn't even add in chips and salsa.  When I am paying $10+ for a standard taco lunch I expect something pretty phenomenal.  This was not it.  I won't be going back.\n\nI'm only giving Joyride 4 stars because of the price.  It seems a bit expensive (if you don't go on a Tues) for some tacos.  With that being said, I've tried 5 or 6 different flavors and they are all delish.  I don't know that I will drive great distances to go there, but if I'm in town I'll definitely eat at Joyride (if I'm not already at one of the other amazing Gilbert restaurants).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a staple for restaurants in Gilbert. A wonderful place to eat at if you are looking for a drink or just good food. I love the crispy fish tacos here and the salsa is amazing! I would rate this place 5 stars on a good day but sometimes the food can be a bit inconsistent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen here a couple times now - Tuesdays are great values with $2 tacos all day and excellent happy hours.  Food, drinks and service are great.  Staff is very friendly and they keep an eye on everything plus keep the place clean even when extremely busy. We always have fun here and it doesn't bust your wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible service. The girls had too many tables which made them nonexistent, been here before and it was the same way. Disappointing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell... The only joy here was when I was riding home putting this place in my rear view mirror.  Truly a letdown... the place was busy (it does have a great atmosphere).  My wife and I were excited to try the food out.  Started with Mexican street corn... unseasoned and out of season corn.  My wife and I each tried 3 different tacos (6 total).  There was not 1 out of the 6 that I would ever want to order again.  Two main themes... under seasoned or strange flavors and little hard burnt bits in almost everything.  The only thing that I thought was passable was the chips and salsa.  Although, after reading other reviews, the question has to be asked... what does this place have against seasoning their food?  And, who are these people who are recommending this place as having great food.  Again it it's a shame that with a great location presentation and atmosphere they could not produce a quality dish.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tacos and drinks.  Can't go wrong with free chips and salsa.  Fish tacos are my favorite!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is a favorite for me and my husband. The food is excellent! Sometimes there can be a long wait, but luckily you can make reservations so we've gotten into the habit of doing that before we head there, especially on weekends. And even if you're stuck waiting a long time outside, they'll give you a drink menu and you can order something while you wait. The atmosphere is lively and service has always been excellent. I love dining on their patio as well. I'm originally from Wisconsin, but have been here 5 years now and every time I have visitors from home, I take them here and they love it! Highly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was midweek date night and we had picked another place to originally go to, but then he stated he was in the mood for some tacos so we walked over to Joyride Tacos. For a Wednesday night it was busy, but not too overly busy and we were able to find seating at the bar right away.\n\nAfter checking out the menu, I went with 2 tacos, the standard & the crispy fish.\n\nThe Standard had slow roasted chicken, avocado, slaw and aji amarillo. This was a great tasting taco, the chicken was tender and the taco was full of flavor. Then I tried the crispy fish taco which was a beer battered fish with slaw, cilantro, pico, guacamole and white sauce. This too was a really good taco, both had great flavors, and the taco shell was perfect, it wasn't too hard or too soft and didn't come apart when eating it.\n\nI also learned on Taco Tuesdays they have some tacos for $2 from 2pm to close, um yes please!!! \n\nJoyride Tacos was a good last-minute choice, look forward to coming back!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As gas prices continue to drop, 28 states are now selling regular gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. It's getting cheaper to pump two gallons of gas outside the station than it is to pump two squirts of nacho cheese inside.\"  Jimmy Fallon\n\nPfft, you know that quote is old.  Gas is expensive AF.\n\nJoyride Taco House is my waifu's, Kazi H., favorite place for Taco Tuesday.  Although we have never gone together or even the same location, this place is great.  Happy hour is from 3PM-5PM and that makes my wallet and me pleased.  You can get tacos for $2 a pop, nachos for $6, and $5 margaritas.  They also serve beer too.\n\nFood is great, location is amazing, and the staff is friendly.  Sit at the bar for the best service imaginable and check out all their nerdy artwork.  Joyride is a great place for a quick bite [especially during HH]!\n\nI'm not into competitive eating, unless someone orders nachos \"for the table.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a pleasure this place was.  Felt like I was on vacation waiting to step out to a sandy beach.    And the food is genuine.   Really fresh yummy.    The drinks very tasty and flavorful.  We ate at the bar and let me tell you we had the\nMost fun in a long time.   Very friendly setting the servers who are behind the bar you can tell like being there.   Gives you a sense of I'm glad I came to eat tacos at joyride.  We liked it so much we would have no problem taking out of town guests here.   This one is a winner.  So it's all in a name they say and joyride lives up to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo my boyfriend and I ventured here for some prime time World Cup viewing as well as  some delicious noms (or food, if you will).\n\nFirst thing's first. This place has the coolest atmosphere  ever (As far as restaurants go). Complete with laid back tunage and retro decor, I was instantly enamored. The smell that emerges from the kitchen is also to die for. Did I mention that they have a weekend happy hour that includes alcoholic agua frescas as well as local pitchers of beer? My goodness... could it get any better...\n\nThe food options are plentiful and everything is extremely fresh. I can't even begin to describe to you the wonderful appeal to the senses that each bite provides. My boyfriend ordered a make your own type of burrito and I ordered the chicken.  (Which sounds plain and boring but is anything but!) Inside the chicken burrito was butternut and chayote squash, spinach, mushroom, avocado, corn, queso, tomatillo salsa, pico gringo and aji amarillo. (i'm salivating just remembering it!) I also washed it down with an ice cold glass of some Four Peaks.... \n\nOverall, if you aren't in the area, this place is worth the drive. Devine food, amazing customer service, and extreme satisfaction all around. I will DEFINITELY be coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really enjoyed their orange cucumber salad, it was super refreshing! I also got the pork adobada and the chicken tinga tacos! Overall, I'd definitely come back here!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe always have fun here! Yesterday we stopped in for some food and margs. We had the cheesy mas and it was great! We also each got a quesadilla and they were fantastic as well. Ask for the habanero salsa if you like spicy stuff, it's worth it. Bartenders were friendly and fast. It's my bday week and we had a free dessert for being on their email list! Churros were great!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy son's favorite, except fish tacos at Rocky Point Mexico. Gruber tacos and sides. Superb\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE Sunday Funday Spot.  Great food, music and even Better service.  Shelby took fantastic care of us and introduced us to Chandler, her Manager who willingly set us up with reservations for 14 (booze cruise posse). Other restaurants around here won't take reservations!!!  The food is fresh and delicious.    We love the standard tacos, the salads are unique and full of flavor.  Their cucumber Serrano margarita is the best margarita I have ever had!  Their happy house specials are amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver priced food and drinks. Noisy atmosphere, and they are always trying to upsell you to buy more appetizers, drinks, etc. Unique food and drinks but nothing really that great. Won't be back. Perhaps it'll improve over time as I like the concept.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like it HOT, ask for their habanero salsa with your chips. Sometimes they charge a little extra for it, sometimes not, we got the not... \n\nEatery offering elevated Mexican street eats, drinks & patio seating in a hip, colorful setting. he chance to enjoy a margarita and taco combo. You can have one drink and two tacos for under $10. You have your choice of carne asada, carnitas, chicken tinga, pork adobada, veggie, crispy fish, and the \"standard,\" which is slow-roasted chicken, avocado and Mexican slaw. All these options are available for $2 each. The discounted price is great for those who want to experience every taco.\n\nPerfect spot for a night out or Lunch\n\nWe love this place! It's not far from our home.\n\nGreat drinks, great food and good service make it a go-to for a night out.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wasn't very impressed. The Tacos(if it's in your name they better be great)  were ok but I've had way better. The kids meal burrito was about as big as my finger. The margaritas were really good. Prices were way to high for the quality and portions of food, but I get it, they have to pay for that prime downtown Gilbert location. I wont be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here even though we live very close. The host upon seating was very nice and let us pick our own seat to accommodate my hubby's football.  It's Saturday and Margaritas are normally 9.75 but still offered a special hooray for $5! Joyride margarita is awesome (high roller it). Kori, our server, was friendly and informative. The Bandit Taco Platter was a great way to try 3 diff meats. Also ordered a Carne Asada taco. The corn tortillas are thick and fluffy made right upon delivery to table. Manager Larry, quickly brought out a new taco without asking when we inquired about a flour tortilla! I \" interrupted\" staff members for little things and not one made me feel like I bothered them or annoyed. (ya know what I mean) lol In conclusion, I will be coming back to Joyride in Gilbert. The meat tender, habanero salsa roasted (not killin me), chips crispy, fresh tortillas. Staff communicates well with each other and fast service.  It's a busy Saturday and I waited all of 3min to place an order. Thank you Larry and Kori for a wonderful first time experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am giving 5 stars because service was on point! The crispy fish tacos are amazing! The atmosphere made me feel like I was out of town! Love the chill vibe and outdoor seating! Staff was amazing! We will be coming back!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had to see what hype was about!!\n\nA little bummed the chips were not gluten free :( but the iced tea is delicious!\n\nThe atmosphere is super fun and retro.\n\nThe food was outstanding. Tons of flavor and filling!\n\nHighly recommend this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing street tacos! Even better is their happy hour and taco Tuesday prices on them!\n\n\n\n\n\nGotta give this place 5 stars for their Happy Hour! The street tacos are fantastic,and you get mini pitchers of beer.  They have some very interesting beers on tap,so the craft folks can find something they like here, but even those like me that want a simpler beer will be satisfied. I stuck to Negro Modelo while dining last week. 2 to 6 PM,and if I remember correctly I think Tuesday's happy hour is all day. Will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the big deal about this place?  Food was good but the atmosphere was moderate the service horrible and the prices were a little steep.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food, sorta messy! Flys outside were a little excessive. But cute staff, very polite and quick! Would recommend but would suggest to sit inside!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe check-in/seating system here is ridiculous. We stood by 3 vacant four top tables while they made two old ladies in front of us stand and wait for 15+ mins, then they finally gave up and sat them at the table that had been vacant the entire time. My mom has a hurt leg and she had to stand and wait even longer because it was too hot outside. Then she all of a sudden they realized they didn't put my name in the iPad, so another two tables was sat in front of us. If it weren't for the good wait staff and food we would have left a lot earlier. They just kept pushing to send people outside and to the bar and saving the tables for special clients apparently. I should mention this was on a Saturday at 1:30pm. The food and drinks were excellent and for that I give it another star.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grand opening week was the first time we visited - tacos with a minuscule amount of meat - but things have much improved.  I'll chalk it up to the loads of trendy skinny -jean wearers trying to be as cool as we are. Now that it's filled with normal citizens, the food is much improved and they do have a nice draft beer assortment along with some wine for my wife.  It's nice to dance between postino next door and here so you can mix it up depending on what you are craving.  Very cool decor inside and a nice big bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food, not so great service. However the food was good enough that I'm willing to put up with the lack of service to eat the food. I got the chicken burrito and it was excellent. It's not traditional rice beans cheese, it had mushrooms, and some other veggies and it was EXCELLENT. The chips and salsa waa decent. The service was the worst part, we didn't know who our server was or who even worked there. Everyone was wearing street clothes, just like all the customers. Seldom came around, had to ask to take our order, had to ask to pay the bill, had to ask for just about everything, there was no checking in or proactive service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe shared a crispy fish taco and the torta with pork. It was delicious! We also got a pitcher of beer for $5 (happy hour) the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the fish taco was pretty small for over $4. The chips and salsa were really good too:)\n\n\n\n\n\nI heard about this place from multiple family and friends who have raved about it so I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Well let's just say I was not real impressed with the food but the service was really good!  The street tacos weren't terrible but nothing great.  I think Sandbar has better tacos, especially the carnitas.  Good prices, good service, good chips and salsa with a cool atmosphere gives it 4 stars\n\n\n\n\n\nJust came back from the restaurant now. It was the middle of the day, so the place was slow. We were a party of 2 and waited over 40 minutes for our food. And when our food did finally come out, it was cold. Completely appalled at the service we received today.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went on a Friday night, when the wait is 20+ minutes. We sat at the bar, and we're immediately greeted with a friendly hello. The drinks came pronto. The Joyride margarita was yummy (and strong). The prickly pear margarita was a little too sweet. We were seated in 20 minutes, and once again received a friendly greeting and fast service. The tacos are amazing. The abodada taco was our favorite. Chandler and Tim both came to our table, just to check on things. The great service & yummy tacos makes this place an A+ in our book.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper fun and open concept restaurant,  in downtown Gilbert. Good service and awesome food. Nice place to unwind after work. I would definitely recommend the tacos ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nVisited this place soon after it opened on the recommendation of a friend. What a surprise! And not a good one. The carne tacos were waay expensive. $3.75 PER TACO! Traveled extensively to most all regions of Mexico, so I've seen many variations on the theme of ,\"Tacos.\" These were some version of \"Caucasian Tacos.\" The Carne had a slightly sweet flavor like the got the meat from Joe's BBQ. Tortillas were soft and pretty good. Many flavors of iced tea. Not saying that is good or bad, but hey. Focus on one good one and stick with it.The place was pretty trendy and reminded me of what a taco shop at the Biltmore would look like. But it was clean and pleasing. Crowd was full of locals with \"Man Buns.\" Urban chic I guess. I sat at the bar, and it smelled like a bar. No big deal. Took a while for uno taco, so when it did arrive, I jumped right in. Didn't notice a salsa bar. Like I said, slightly sweet flavor, not what I was looking for, as I was looking for AUTHENTIC. And I was honest when the waiter came and asked me how it was. Sat and enjoyed the view and finished my tea. When I asked for the check, the guy said that it was comped, and he was sorry for the dis-appointing taco. I graciously thanked him and left Almost the total bill for a tip. And for it's popularity. I guess it's not the authenticity that people come here for. And that's ok too.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went in with some girlfriends on Friday night, we sat down at about 9:45pm and ordered a couple margarita's which were good and tasty. Unfortunately, that was the only good thing.  The female  wait staff all seemed like they were on drugs, just odd behavior and super fast and twitchy.  We ordered some tacos which were at best bland and really nothing to write home about.  The beans were good and the chips weren't bad.  It was also odd that the wait staff was using a table in the restaurant as their personal dining table.  Although it was winding down, it just seemed unprofessional.  I live downtown and won't be going back, So-Cal Fish Taco has way better food and service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe really love the food from here! I only give it 4 stars because honestly every single time we have been the waiters are so raunchy and not very nice. Service is pretty slow and drinks are never refilled. Very short with us and just don't take the time to make sure we are satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, I love how open and hipster - looking this restaurant is. The staff is nice. You can spot the manager keep going around checking on customers. Their tacos are great with beautiful presentation. Tortilla soup has a fresh taste with a subtle kick so be careful if you're not good with spicy food. \nI came during happy hour so I decided to order a fresh pineapple  juice with rum. However, I'm pretty sure they forgot to put rum in there. The manager happened to check on us right then so I told him I didn't really taste the alcohol. Immediately, I watched him making me a new drink at the bar. This time, he made sure he filled the glass with what tasted like 50% rum ;) Great service recovery. Will definitely come back again to try another dish on the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love everything Upwards Projects (Postino, Churn, Windsor, Federal Pizza) does, and Joyride is no different.\n\nOver 3,000 square feet of space, patios in the front and back, garage doors on each side, colorful leather seats, eclectic art, and a hint of Baja created an overall relaxed destination for enjoying a modern twist on Mexican.  The music ranged from \"Eleanor Rigby\" by The Beatles to \"Little Red Corvette\" by Prince, which I loved.\n\nWe started with Aqua Frescas at the bar.  Almond Horchata spiked with Amaretto liqueur (nutty, sweet, hints of cinnamon, perfect) and a Cucumber Mint with vodka.  It was pulpy, sweet, and divine.  All of their juices are squeezed fresh daily and include pineapple, citrus, and strawberry.  A spike legend on the menu gives you recommendations on best spirits to combine with each. Non alcoholic is $3.5, with spirit $8 ($5 during HH).\n\nAs with any traditional Mexican restaurant, we received salsa and chips.  The fire roasted salsa and chips are complimentary, but other salsas are available for $2 or 3 for $5.  These are the tomatillo, guajillo pepita, pico gringo, chile de Arbol, and charred habanero.  The salsas were described as either \"kinda hot\" or \"melt your face\".\n\nThe tacos came on \"made to order\" corn tortillas served family style.  The presentation of the tacos was fantastic!  We tried the carne asada, the crispy as well as grilled fish, chicken tinga, and carnitas ranging from $3.50-4.50.\n\nThere were also four types of burritos such as \"The Beast\" with carne asada, Anasazi beans, avocado, fire roasted salads and pico gringo.\n\nI enjoyed the Chicken Burrito with rotisserie chicken, avocado, pico gringo, and a white and creamy Aji Amarillo.  This also came with a garden variety mix of Cremini mushrooms, peppers, corn, and squash, which I skipped.\n\nOverall, menu is fairly simple and straightforward, with some modern twists here and there.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove love love this place, definitely my go to place for happy hour, I tried almost all the Margarita drinks they offer for happy hour and they were all good. My favorite is the Watermelon Margarita. Also, the tacos are so good, I have tried almost all of them as well and the ones I've tries so far are so good. Definitely, coming back to try everything else.\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good tacos but pricey... $5 tacos! :(\nNice restaurant and good service!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food.  Awesome atmosphere.\nService can be slow on busy nights but that's inevitable.\nI love the classic margarita vs. the specialty.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food , music and drinks. Recommend the Baja fish Taco and cucumber Serrano margarita.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am biased.  I love this place.  I love the atmosphere and the service.  The wait staff is great.  My glass in never empty and the chips keep coming.  \nIt is priced a little high...but well worth it to me.  The quality of the food is great and the Carne Asada is a favorite.\nThe El Capitan Torta is amazing.  I can eat about 6 of them without blinking.\nThat's why I'm fat.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ended up walking here because Postino's next door had a 45 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon. And boy, am I glad we did. We ordered the chicken nachos, 3 different tacos. My favorite was the braised beef taco. To drink we had their blood orange margarita, which was phenomenal. \n\nOnly downside is that I couldn't ell who worked there and who didn't. The waiters do not use uniforms or even the same colors. I think the manager was our waiter and he had a Batman shirt on.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur tacos were cold, the fish tacos came with just one tiny fish piece, and no lime or hot sauce offered. The guacamole saved the day, it was great. One thing that was strange was that the sides came out on the flat appetizer dishes like they ran out of side dishes. I guess I just expected a better fish taco. \nWith so many options next door, tough to come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI did not enjoy the flavor or quality of food. Crazy busy and I have no clue why. Staff average food below average cost high. I don't get it.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is good, but not worth the price.\n\nEverything here is pricey. The tacos here are between $3.75 and $4.50, the small bowl of guacamole is $8 and the drinks are about $9. \n\nThey serve up a complimentary basket of chips, but charge you for refills. That INCLUDES the refill you need to eat the $8 guac you just ordered. Hard to believe the $8 doesn't include chips...\n\nThe food was tasty and the drinks were creative, but overall the experience didn't match the price.\n\nI recommend going during happy hour. Maybe then you can still afford rent!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to try this place and we were not disappointed. The vibe is modern trendy Mexican, so if you are hoping for authentic go somewhere else. The restaurant is situated in Downtown Gilbert next to other fantastic restaurants. My biggest thank you to the owner and chef goes to the portion and flavor. In an environment of over sized American gluttony this place provides the \"right\" size for an entree. I ordered 3 tacos, Chicken, Pork and Carne Asada with a side of Black beans... I was very satisfied. The Salsa was AMAZING and helped round out the meal. Overall a strong contender for an evening out, happy hour or even with the kids!\n\n\n\n\n\nNice taco spot here in the heart of Gilbert. Tacos are similar to street style tacos but slightly bigger and made a notch up from your typical street tacos. I mixed and matched my tacos with my personal favorite being the carne asada. Restaurant has a full bar as well as inside and outside seating with misters. Unfortunately I have been here twice now and have received less then spectacular service on both occasions specifically relating to getting the bill way after we are finished with our meal and clearly waiting around\n\n\n\n\n\n2 strikes and you are out as far as I'm concerned.\nMy first visit was over a month ago and I met some friends for a Sunday brunch. My boyfriend and I got there early so we sat at the bar and ordered beers. I have to say, the bar staff was awesome! Quick service and very helpful. That was the good part.\nGot to our table and not only was our server apparently having a really bad day, she was extremely slow and not very polite. We had to wait for drinks, wait for food etc.. The table next to us complained about the same server and amazingly enough, the service got faster and much better. The food was okay, but nothing to write home about, but the bartenders were so nice I figured I would give this place another try.\n\nThis past weekend, we went again to celebrate my friends birthday. It was a Saturday night and they were busy, but that is to be expected on a Saturday. We sat outside in the grassy area and they told us we could get drinks there while we waited. Well, we waited and waited and waited and finally the server came over for our drink order. It was the same server I had on my first experience at Joyride. This should have been my first clue that things would not go well, but I figured the first visit was a fluke. So we get our round of drinks and waited......................................waited for an hour and a half and the server never came back for another drink order. She came back to other folks and we tried to flag her down, but nothing. I ended up having to get a manager because by this time none of us were happy. Manager promptly came over and got us a round of drinks on the house, but not before she commented on how many empty glasses were at our table, basically accusing us of having more drinks than what I told her. If she had counted she could have seen that there were 9 glasses and 8 people. The extra glass was from water that I had to go get myself.\nAt any rate, service is horrible, food is okay, but since this is the second time I have been there and the service was horrible both times, I won't be back. My friends said they would not be back either because this is not the first bad experience they have had.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally was able to go to Joyride on a lunch date and give it a try.  After many good recommendations and reviews, I would have to say this place met and exceeded expectations.\n\nThe chips and salsa were phenomenal.  The chips were fresh and crispy, but didn't taste like the other paper thin generic chips served at other chain establishments.  The salsa was also very fresh and flavorful, and had a great kick to it.  It was a little spicy for my wife though, which is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nI ordered a quesadilla and my wife ordered a few tacos and we split the meals.  We only finished about half the quesadilla and had half a taco left after we were both stuffed.  The food was great!  Great flavors and awesome presentation.  I wasn't surprised at food or service based on reviews and will be returning here to enjoy another lunch or dinner soon.  \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the service was excellent.  It looked like a replica staff of the one at Postino.  I'm not sure when Gilbert suffered a hipster movement, but apparently this historic Downtown Gilbert area is attractive to the new age hippy as a place of employment.  Regardless, the staff was pretty good and service was above average. \n\nJoyride would be a great Saturday afternoon spot to have a couple of drinks and some tacos and I would highly recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything started out good. The girl who took our name was super friendly and nice and took us to our table, she then quickly brought us waters and chips. Two baskets of chips was pretty nice since it was only 4 adults and 2 kids. Moments laters our waitress showed up and look like she was pretty nice she took our orders my dad ordered the nachos with carne asada I ordered the beast. My dad also got a agua fresca and the kids a kids meal. The waitress never brought my dad or the kids their drink someone else had to. Just to say the least our own waitress didn't even bring the food. She would pass by and then turn around. The nachos came and they were made with braised beef. I was cutting into my burrito a long hair was in there they took it back and still had to pay for it..My dad kept getting refills of the agua but little did we know they were charging him everytime. So food was an ok and service just sucked. Never had been to this one in Gilbert only the one on Central. We live in Tucson and decided to go since we had such a great experience from the other one but never again will we be back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've dined here 3 times and have to admit that I can't get past the fish taco!  YUM!  Crunchy, flavorful--So yummy!  There are many other treats to try at this establishment.  The decor is fun, seating in a booth is comfortable with others and the service is always consistently right on.  They will do for you whatever it takes!  You place your order, and it's there in hardly no time at all.  Fresh!\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly amazing food batman!  We usually get the tacos and they never cease to amaze!  Our favorite tacos in order are: Crispy Fish, Braised Beef then Shrimp.  We had these the first time and loved them so much, we end up getting them every time we go! The margaritas are also amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery Tuesday I come to Joyride and not just for the amazing $2 taco price but because they have the best customer service, best atmosphere, and hands down the best tacos.  Every time I come Tori the hostess greets us in the nicest way and she literally memorized us within two visits and now it's become our weekly (must go) taco Tuesday tradition!  All of their staff have Beautiful personalities and every experience I've had was just perfect! Also they have the most respectful and kind manager in the world Nick he always goes table to table to check on all the guests. He visits our table every time my group and I come in! Whether you're bring your family or your friends this is one taco place you have to try\n\n\n\n\n\n5-17-17.  I have been wanting to try this place as I have heard good things.  First the atmosphere is nice, a very trendy retro vibe.  The large bar in the middle of the room looked like a fun place to sit if you were by yourself or with one friend.  It was a Saturday night about 5:30 so the place was crowded.  We were told we had to wait 20 minutes and found a place to sit outside while we waited.  A waitress came around and asked all of us who were waiting if we wanted to order drinks.  She did not offer any drink menus so I didn't know about the extensive margarita selection this place has.  I ordered the regular house margarita which was freshly made with real lime juice.  I really liked it.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait on the outside patio.  This area is kept cool with misters so it was enjoyable for people watching. Our waiter was very pleasant and brought hot chips and salsa out right away.  I ordered the crispy fish taco, carne asada taco and a side of rice.  The tacos come in a little metal taco holder so they stay up and the filling doesn't fall out.  The rice came on a separate little plate.  The crispy fish taco I ordered was just OK,  it was not hot and it wasn't really crisp either.  It was like the fish was cooked a while ago and held under a hot light. I have had better elsewhere.  The carne asada taco had nice flavoring and had crispy pieces like you would get from your backyard barbeque.  These tacos were small street tacos.  The rice was typical mexican rice.  Nothing special here.  Overall my opinion is the margarita was great and the food OK but I didn't feel the atmosphere and food made the price worth it for me to want to come back.  I don't live near here so I don't think this is a place I will repeat to.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat happy hour and great tacos! Never a bad visit- staff always attentive and great team work! Margaritas are on point and good selection of beer! Usually end up here once or twice a month for some chips and dip - drink and tacos!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food, excellent service, will definitely return. Got seated immediately, I got my water refilled like 3 times, the waiters kept checking in. I'm very impressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is pretty good. Not great but good. Might be better if you're a drinker. Id recommend the chicken burrito.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing atmosphere really makes the experience that much better. Not to mention the food is always delicious and the beer selection is great!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was so disappointed with my experience here because I was so looking forward to it from looking at reviews and pictures on Yelp. The menu looks amazing so I had high expectations. The service wasn't great, slow and sloppy. Although the drinks and food look amazing, the taste was terrible. Don't order the Watermelon Margarita! The veggie enchiladas looked perfect but the taste was just not good. I won't be coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd trip and not disappointed. Wait staff super friendly and responsive. Tacos are amazing with Grilled Shrimp and Pork Adobada being a tie for 1st. Local beer on tap which I think is important and dog friendly for the dog crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place. Good service, tasty food and a fun atmosphere. \n\nThe drinks are AMAZEBALLS... Omg. Plus $5 for a pitcher of delicious brew before 5 pm makes this my go to weekend lunch spot. Salsa's have a lot a flavor and good heat and the tacos are delicious. I was not impressed with the Chicken Tinga, it was just OK, the fish taco's are wonderful and the tortillas are handmade. The tortilla soup is really tasty as well, it can be a little to thick, but has great flavor. You have to order the cheese y mas... oh buddy. I could eat that all day erry day!\n\nOverall, you should go here - belly up to the bar, the bartenders are fun and the service is great.\n\n\n\n\n\nFoods are good, specially the tacos. Nice employees and great place to hangout. Indoor area is nice and outdoor backyard is very romantic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was good from checking in to paying our bill. Loved the open feeling even while sitting inside. Food and drinks were excellent and priced well. All in all a great experience and will be coming back next time we're in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nBruh. The carne asada in the beast burrito was trash. The elote was over priced but was the only saving grace to this god awful place my boyfriend and I tried on a whim. Couldn't get a drink refill for the life of me, but after I'm finished with my meal the waitress decides to refill my drinks. $12 for a cardboard burrito. I enjoyed writing this painfully honest review more than I did the food. \n\nOn the bright side if you love dubstep and terrible remixes of Sam Smith and Adele you'll fit right in with the try hard atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place for ambience and good quality food. Food was fresh and I was able to find Vegan and Gluten Free options. What more can I ask for? Oh wait, house Salsa needs a little bit kick for another 1 star. Overall great experience and I will definitely visit again.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tacos. Hot looking customers. Great atmosphere.The staff went out if their way to please, I even got the phone number of our server... score!\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to joyride for the first time two nights ago woth a friend of mine, it was absolutely amazing! Great prices! Preston was our bartender and made our margarita it was delicious! Gabe was serving and was just being friendly talking to us and recommended a very tasty tequila. I had 2 tacos chicken tinga and my friend had the beast burrito. Both very delicious! I would definitely recommend this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is great for vegetarian, dairy/gluten free options. Fish, vegetables, shrimp and grains, all good stuff. The best Horchata in the valley!\n\nThe service is a bit touch and go.\nThat being said, I've been here before with a guest and we were completely ignored after ordering a drink and being seated. We got the drink and were left with our menus for over twenty minutes. We left cash on the table and left completely unnoticed... this has also happened to me once before on a busy weeknight. \n\nI come here at least once a month since DT Gilbert is in my neighborhood and I appreciate a place where it's easy to find foods that I can eat on this menu!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is not bad.  The place is very loud and it is hard to hold a conversation while eating.  The staff seems to me is pretentious, like they are doing you a favor by tending on you (or it could have been the person that waited on us).  I might go back to it in a few months...\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride was excellent for happy hour.  The tacos were amazing with flavor and the house margaritas and beer specials were very good.  Friendly staff as well.  Make sure to get there early or you could be waiting in a big line which means others feel the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust because  they serve tacos does not mean its a mexican restaurant it was like taco bell and Dennys got together. Had 3 tacos beef chick and fish all pretty  much tastes the same...fish...\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Happy Hour Taco's!  Two-words of advice: Queso Fundido.\n\n\n\n\n\nvery cool environment, great staff who have earned their chops at postinos and Windsor downtown (great to see familiar faces).  have been here several times with friends and each time very nice.  i had tamales and they were tasty but a little dry, asked for some enchilada sauce - excellent.  good food, house salsa is super tasty, margs are excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun atmosphere and the food was great, thanks to the Yelper recommendations! Mexican street corn is fantastic, I loved the vegetarian pinto beans, and the crispy fish tacos are awesome! My friend and I split an appetizer, 4 tacos, and a side of pinto beans. It came out to about $12. Worth a try for sure!\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped here for a quick bite before a night out! Great location and service. Food was good and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was fun and we enjoyed ourselves. Good selection of tacos! The favorite for us all was the cheese y mas(cheese dip w/chorizo) it was sooooooo good!\n\n\n\n\n\nI keep reading about people going to Joyride for Taco Tuesday but they neglect to mention that the $2.00 tacos are not available until after 2pm.  I went last week at 1pm for lunch and was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get the tacos for the Taco Tuesday price.  \n\nI found the food to be on the spicy side, which some people like but I don't.  The chips they brought out was good and the salsa was fine-but again, it was too spicy for me. \n\nGood atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nso yummy! we got tacos and chips with several different salsas to try and it was really good. it got very loud as the night went on but our server was nice and always checked on us.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally like the food here.  Great variety of tacos--love taco Tuesday. I really like the fish tacos.  Blood Orange margarita is very good. Nice Happy Hour. Service is great, casual.   Nice outdoor seating area. Love the ambience and energy in here.  A younger demographic then Postino's next door if that matters. My hubby had a burrito that was great.  Wish I could remember which one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place was really nice we sat outside on the patio which had the fire place and the lights made it cozy and comfy. The food wasn't really that great the tacos were loaded with too much cabbage and veggies barely any meat and the nachos had the white magic sauce which was really gross maybe not for my taste buds. Customer service was great!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love coming here for dinner.  Always enjoyable.  The music is a little loud inside, so we try to sit outside instead.  The food is well priced and so far never a bad meal.  Try to arrive before 5pm for \"before 5\" prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrated a good friend's birthday and our party of 6 had great service from Ashlyn who was a delight.  She is the perfect mix of friendly, efficient and happy to take good care of her customers.\n3 of our guests had never been to JoyRide before so we had lots of questions and asked Ashlyn for recommendations and suggestions. We ordered a wide variety of choices and had fun sharing each other's food, getting to enjoy a wide selection of new foods.\nFrom drink orders to appetizers, then dinner and dessert we all enjoyed everything and agree we will all be back to celebrate again. You can be sure we will ask for Ashlyn to be our server again.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun vibe and great staff. We came for happy hour and sat at a booth in their indoor/outdoor dining room. Free chips and salsa all night long. Drinks ranged from good to great. Love the $5 mini-pitchers. I forgot how much I like the San Tan Epicenter, which I used to order from Postino next door.  Some of the cocktails were a little sweet for my liking but they offered good pours. The aguas frescas tasted good too but I had to ask for some extra kick from the not-as-strong liqueurs. Can't say anything about food other than it seemed overpriced. Irrelevant side note: I really enjoyed the wheel knobs on the bathroom sinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't your typical Mexican restaurant. They use an orange citrus flavor on many things which is delicious. I love their chips and salsa. \nThe location is fantastic but they do get busy so expect a wait during busy hours. \nI usually get the Carne Asada Quesidila\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Joyride. It is one of my favorite downtown Gilbert restaurants. The atmosphere and food/drinks are always amazing. My favorite is the chicken burrito..... And the mango mandarin margarita...  The the spicy around the rim!!!  Joyride will always be a go to place for me!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, it's not bad...but it's not great either. Walking in I was pumped to hear Deltron through the speakers and see the place was not as pretentious as I had heard from the grape vine. Since I'm not one for negativity I'll start out with some positives. A wide selection of aguas frescas with the option of adding booze to it was quite a delight, and the salsa they bring out with your complimentary chips was actually tasty as a mofo. Service was pretty good and,,, well...that's about it. If you are going to be charging around 4 bucks each for mf'n street tacos they better be amazing, the truth is they were not. You could score a hell of a better fish taco at rubios, the cochinito pibil tasted like a corona with a few cigarette butts floating inside, and the short rib was alright...just kick up the seasoning. A few adjustments and this place could be a gem.\n\n\n\n\n\nMediocre. Tacos are OK. Had the fish tacos and I didn't think it taste that good.i was told they were the best tacos at Joyride but I personally would've just eaten their chips and salsa the whole time. It's too high in price, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was amazing. The Standard taco was meh but all other tacos are worth coming back. Oh yeah, the blood orange margarita alone is worth coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\ngreat food and drinks! almond horchata is delicious and good beer.\n\n\n\n\n\nI absolutely love Joy Ride.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the food is even better. I typically go in on the weekends and sometimes we have to wait a little bit to be seated but it is worth it.\n\nThe chips and salsa are amazing, and normally I go for the tacos. Crispy Fish is my favorite. Tortillas, batter, and sauces are so yummy.\n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes with their style of service (you don't have one particular server, they all kind of split zones and help out), you end up telling multiple people \"No, I don't need another refill\" or whatever the case is. But all in all, wonderful!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally beautiful environment, laid back with a little pop of color but not overwhelming to the eye... And more importantly, the food! How do you beat $2 tacos on happy hour and $5 margaritas? You don't. The crispy fish taco was amazing, it didn't have fish that was falling apart and the crispy exterior was just as satisfying as a bag of your favorite chips. Enchiladas had great flavor and everything from the meats to the tortillas were the exact texture that you look for in the two. Meats weren't too tough and neither were the tortillas. Our server Francisco was wonderful as well, great attitude, upbeat, kept it light and easy, and dished out subtle but amusing remarks. Will definitely be coming back. Love the food, love the ambiance, and love the service!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's good - just not craveable. The prices are a bit high for \"street tacos\". They do have great drinks and an wonderful environment. People seem to like to come here - and I wonder if it's because postino's next door is too busy...\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome tacos and food, a little expensive though. Can get crowded and loud. Would be a good place for a group of hearing impaired people that can communicate through sign language. Which I actually did witness there when I went.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here! Great place love the Blood Orange Margarita !! Food was greattasting ,  portions are small for the price ! Would go back !\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm surprised by all of the great reviews on the food at Joyride. I visited last week with my son. I love the atmosphere, the service was great. The food however, was terrible. We had the nachos. very little cheese (not melted) and too much of a white sauce with a very strange flavor, did not enjoy them at all.  Also tried the carne asada tacos. The meat has a very sweet flavor, very noticeably sweet. When I asked about it, they told me the meat is marinated in orange juice and does have a sweet flavor. They traded them out for the shredded beef tacos which I also did not enjoy. The corn tortillas on all the tacos are soft and quickly become soggy so the whole thing falls apart when you try to pick it up. My son had the red chile tamales. Besides red chile, they also had strips of carrots and zucchini inside (not indicated on the menu). The beans had no flavor. We love mexican food but were so disappointed. Despite the fun decor and atmosphere, we would not go back. If you are looking for good, authentic mexican, this is not the place. It's nothing like Carolina's or La Canasta (very good simple authentic mexican food) - they can't even compete with Macayos. The chips were ok, didn't like the salsa though. In addition, our bill was over $30. I don't mind paying for good food but expensive for terrible food? Seems like the kind of place that gets a lot of one time customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisited with my cousin and the service was wonderful! We recommend the fresh fruit juices with the add of your choice of alcohol. Yum!  Everything was so fresh and good. The churros with caramel is the best. I'm happy heading home.\n\n\n\n\n\nThoroughly enjoyed Taco Tuesday. Had The Standard (chicken), Carne Asada, and Crispy Fish Tacos along with a few Pineapple Mojitos .... Delish!\n\n\n\n\n\nCute place. Love their horchata fresco with vanilla vodka. Street corn is delicious. HH pitchers $5 (2.5 glasses). Gets loud and crowded in the evening. They pool tips so maybe thats why service is good.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat ambiance and outdoor seating. I was able to bring my friends dog here and have a fun and relaxed time. This obviously isn't an authentic Mexican place but still great tasting!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Snooze next door refused my reservation of 20 people for my wedding rehearsal brunch, it's safe to say bridezilla was about to make an appearance. Thankfully my now husband calmed me down and got us in at Joyride m, and thank god for that. What bride to be doesn't need a margarita at 11 in the morning?! Great food, great drinks and an even better staff. Thank you so much for making our rehearsal lunch amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet tacos + hipster vibe = super popular place \nDid it live up to the hype? Weeelll, it was good but not great. The restaurant itself and the service partially make up for the food (more on that later). The decor and ambiance are fun. The wait staff was very nice and extremely prompt in their service: taking our orders, refilling drinks, bringing the check, etc. That's especially impressive as we went on Taco Tuesday when it's supposedly busier. We got there around 5 and were seated immediately. They were still seating immediately at 5:45 when we left. \n\nThe music was too loud, though at least it wasn't terrible music. The main issue is that with the music that loud, you almost have to yell to be heard by your dinner companions, which makes the restaurant twice as loud. I will never understand why restaurants think you come to listen to their mundane background music. If it's a live band, okay. Otherwise, you obviously want to talk to (not shout at) whomever you're having dinner with. (Rant concluded.)\n\nAs for the food, they're small street tacos in thick, almost pita-thickness, flour tortillas. The Standard was the best of the four we tried. It was pretty good, but not amazing. The Carnitas was good once we divested it of all the fatty gristle, but it seems like they don't choose their meat for that particularly well. All-in-all, I've had better tacos for a cheaper price. Still, I was okay with paying $2 apiece for these, but I would not pay any more than that (so only going during happy hour or on Tuesdays). We also had the churros with chocolate dipping sauce--that was very good. Nice quality churros and creamy delicious chocolate. So a very nice dining experience (5 stars) + not bad food (3 stars) = 4 stars overall\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is probably my favorite happy hour location in Gilbert - you can't beat the specials. $5 pitchers of beer, $5 Margaritas, $5 Agua Frescas (before 5pm). Plus, they have taco tuesdays. The place gets busy for sure, but the staff has been great every time I've been in. \n\nThe outdoor patio is spacious (and dog friendly!).\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat ambience, good food, fun place to hang with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good food but agree that it sometimes seems a little on the expensive side for what you get during normal hours.  Happy hour prices are great though, we love the $5 drinks and $2 tacos!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have yet to meet an Upwards Project establishment that I didn't like!  \n\nThe decor is awesome. Hip and comfortable. The outside patio chairs look uncomfortable but are. The chairs inside look comfy too.  The patio has misters- and you don't get soaked!!   \n\nThe menu is simple. Tacos, burritos, sides, desserts, and a nice drink menu. As any good restaurant should, they brought out complimentary chips and salsa. Very tasty!  Chips were nice and crispy!  I had the chicken burrito.  My only complaint was the menu did not specify mushrooms were in it. It only mentioned a garden variety mix. Luckily they were huge chunks so easy to remove!  I also had the Mexican corn. If you like cheese, you'll love this.  Cheese was all I could taste. $5 for a piece of corn was a bit much, so between that and the fact the food does not come with a side (no rice or beans?).  This is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  The food was excellent though.  We also shared dessert. The Mo's Definitely was good, and I can't wait to go back and try the others. \n\nThe drinks were great too!  I had the Mexican Mule. Nice for a warm summer day out on the patio. My friend had a blood orange margarita, that was good too!\n\nFinally, I have to comment on the service. We went on opening day (6/4) and I expected slow, quirky service. Nope!  Other than the fact our server thought the corn came with 2 cobs, which he quickly corrected himself on, he knew the menu, made great recommendations, had out stuff out to us fast and brought exactly what we ordered. All of the staff there were very friendly, smiling, always checking up on us and refilling water. You'd never know they just opened, no opening day kinks that I could see.\n\nThis is a great addition to the area, I can't wait to go back and taste more of the menu!\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably the SE valleys best spot for tacos and a beer. A great vibe and excellent food with great service. \n\nWe went on a Sunday evening around 5:30 and it was packed but cleared up around 6:30\n \nFamily friendly and kid friendly too.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally I love So Cal for fish tacos! Today they were very unprepared for the lunch crowd!!  Never have I waited so long for service! Someone simply stopping by our dirty table, introducing themselves and letting us know it would be a few minutes was obviously too much to ask for. We walked out and walked across the street to Joyride Taco House where we were greeted with a smile, and impeccable service even though they have a packed house as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnded up here when we saw our intended restaurant was packed. Nice open seating and bar. Smaller menu but all sounded good. Both my hubby and I ordered the the beast burrito. Carne asada, avocado, beans, salsa. We asked for no rice in our burritos. Diet coke, iced tea. Burritos tasted good with fresh tasting ingredients. Service was quick. Unfortunately, lots of grisely pieces of unchewable meat. I get it, sometimes a bad piece gets through but I had like 4. For 11.50$ a burrito I expect better quality meat. Good chips and salsa.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here on my birthday which was in January. Aquarius baby.   I loved the tacos very delicious, my fave was the braised beef taco.  What was the best about thing about this  place? it was the atmosphere and it's open and spacious no matter where you are seated. It feels very San Diego for a Gilbert resto.  Very fun and would like to return for happy hour and more tacos please!\n\n\n\n\n\nBest drinks!  Love the Strawberry Aqua Fresca. Tacos are Yum, fish and chicken are my favorite.   Guacamole  is worth adding .\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy hour is the best. The $5 margaritas are so good and strong. Love the crispy fish and chicken tinga tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am very picky when it comes to mexican food or any kind of latin food. I am of Mexican italian decent and my wife is from central america so we know what is good. I was kind of skeptical about this joint due to the name and location. Gave it a chance and WOW I was impressed with the quality of the tacos and other food they had. Very tasty food and is done with pride...I would say it is a little pricy but if your having drinks and a night out its the perfect food to have with a beer,,\n\n\n\n\n\nCame in around 11am on a Sunday.... Awesome tacos and Mexican Street Corn. Great happy hour, daily from open to 5pm!!!! Can't beat $5 pitchers. Fast, excellent service and delicious food. Overall, a great experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaco Tuesdays is where it's at.  $2 for most tacos here after 2pm on Tuesdays (and $5 margaritas!).  I've moved out of Arizona but come back once or twice a year to visit the family.  It's really incredible how downtown Gilbert has expanded and modernized to accommodate so many new businesses.  People actually come here to eat now :o.  It's also awesome to see that the space that Postino and Joyride is in is now finally home to a successful business.\n\nJoyride has delicious Tex-Mex style tacos (my favs so far are the carne asada and the standard), and great service.  The staff is always friendly, and the space is nice and open.  I love how the setup lets you simultaneously eat, watch TV, and take in all that downtown Gilbert has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food here is sooooooooooo good! The prices are a little high but the portions are a good size! Plan on waiting to be seated, most nights it's crowded.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver priced tacos. Did not enjoy this place at all. From the food, environment, pricing, all bad. Didn't try their drinks but it looks like that's what they are known for. So if you just wanna drink then I guess this is the place to go. If you're wanting good food at a decent price, then look somewhere else. Sorry Joyride Taco House.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent our weekly date night at Joy Ride Tacos tonight. Our server, Gabriel, made our experience great! His taco recommendations were spot on, and he was fast, friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nYummo! Went around 6:45 on a Thursday and had a 25 min. wait to eat inside (outside was no wait). You can use the No Wait app on your phone to make it even easier. A kind gentleman offered us water while we waited outside by the misters. They sent a text once our table was ready. We were at a four top near the bar in really cool looking, comfortable chairs. Immediately, our server, Allie, greeted us and we were given warm chips and salsa. We liked the chips but found the salsa to be mediocre. The decor was neat, kinda hipster with funky wallpaper and multi-colored chairs. The bar area is pretty big with cool lights hanging down. Those were pretty much the only lights because it was super dark and loud inside. \n\nWe ordered:\n-Street corn\n-Nachos with chicken\n-Carnitas taco\n-standard (chicken) taco \n-crispy fish taco\n-cucumber orange salad (as side that comes with 3 tacos)\n\nThe corn was brought before the rest of our food with a knife to cut it off the cob. The best street corn I have ever had and the large cob slathered in cojita cheese and spices was well worth the $5. Get this! Hubby liked his nachos, especially the addition of magic white sauce. He did feel that the addition of chicken was overpriced for what he received. \n\nTo try a variety, I ordered the three tacos and cucumber salad. They forgot to bring fish taco and the salad with my meal but this was quickly remedied. The salad side was great-vinegar based and refreshing. The standard taco was not very good and lacked any flavor. The carnitas was pretty good but again, could have used a touch more salt or sauce. The crispy fish taco was great and the ingredients added all the necessary textures to make each bite mouth watering. Even though they are small, I found the tacos to be filling.\n\nWe will definitely be back on a Tuesday to get $2 tacos and $5 margaritas. The prickly pear and watermelon versions looked fabulous. For all that we ate, our bill was only $32. Great date night meal and we are excited to have tried this out. Park in the large free lot off of Page to avoid parking headache. Now go get your taco on! \n-\n\n\n\n\n\nFun spot but blaring music inside a small concrete space doesn't work well. That said they have a decent 70's - 90's mix running on the night I was there. \n\nThe chips and salsa were very good. Crispy chips and spicy salsa. My wife doesn't like it hot and they gave her tomatillo which was also delicious. \n\nShe got a fish taco plus two chicken tacos. She liked hers and thought they were solid. I got the taco platter (spicy chicken, carnitas and carne asada. The asada was basically charbroiled and in would have preferred the pork and chicken to be more unique meat ingredients versus stews. The beans and rice we both fine and avacado ripe. The blood orange margarita was the bomb so that helped everything! \n\nI would go back and try some more street tacos and maybe a burrito and definitely sample the other margaritas.\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos are good.  I recommend going on a Tuesday, so you can get more bang for your buck as many of the tacos are half off.  Unique and flavortul margaritas.  I ordered one of the chile ones and it was very tasty.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh my gosh I missed out on JoyRide the past years it's been open but went last night and was so impressed.  The beast burrito chimichanga style was amazing.  Joyride's carne asada is the best carne asada I've had and I've had a lot of carne asada\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere is cool, but the tacos aren't the greatest. They're good, but nothing to write home about; especially for the price. I got shrimp and fish tacos and paid more than what I'm typically used to paying. It was a cool place to experience, but I wouldn't be back unless the flavor improved.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis taco house is located in downtown Gilbert. We stopped here for lunch while shopping in town. We were greeted immediately. The seating host asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I said we wanted an inside booth. We were seated outside under a tree. The waitress brought chips and salsa. While getting our drinks debris kept dropping out of the tree above us. I asked if we could go inside and we did. I ordered a burrito, \"The Beast\". This is a burrito made with carne asada, pinto beans, avocado, Pico de Gallo. and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla. I wasn't impressed with this Americanized burrito. It lacked flavor and was rather dry. I can't give this place more than a 2 star when Filaberto's has a better burrito for half the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was FANTASTIC - and the food was very good. Had the chicken burrito as an Enchilada- delicious! Will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were really let down when we came here. Went to celebrate a birthday this past Friday night, took 15 minutes to get waters and an additional 20 minutes for a margarita. The music was so loud I couldn't hear the person next to me. The food was average but took way too long for even a Friday night. Drinks were not refilled unless we flagged someone down. I don't think I'll be returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery yummy, but overpriced, and mediocre Mexican ride and beans. The one thing I love from here is the shrimp tacos! \nI think it's more of a fad place to go because it's downtown Gilbert! The restaurant is nice, and clean, but sometimes you feel passed up by the waitress/waiters because they're are so many people in there.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food I really enjoyed the Surfers chicken. They had a great iced tea Long Island iced tea that is. That is why I'm using my voice to text recognition cuz I can't really type right now! LOL yeah come on down and check it out I think you will have a pretty cool time.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is my new favorite restaurant. \n\nI am absolutely in love with the food, decor and their TACOS! My absolute favorite is the crispy fish taco. \n\nWe went in on my birthday and ordered an appetizer, tacos and a few sides. The tacos came out but the appetizer didn't come out until we were done eating our meal. I told the waiter how late the appetizer was, and the manager came right over and took care of the whole meal! Not at all what we were expecting but so wonderful and kind on my birthday.\n\nJoyride is absolutely wonderful from the customer service to the great food! I love this place and go back as much as I can.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome location and perfect vibe. Decor is awesome but the food and drinks are to die for. Spent a wonderful afternoon eating the incredible food and some great specialty drinks. Highly recommend!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food but I've been up for a few hours with what seems to be food poisoning. This is all I've eaten out of the norm.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing veggie tacos! Salsa is also delicious! The guac is a must try as well! Beautiful atmosphere and wonderful, kind staff. You must visit here if you are anywhere near Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast time I was there (a few weeks ago), a random female server delivered our pitcher and one cold glass...even though there were 2 adults at the table. She wasn't our server - I think her name was Kim or something. She dropped the stuff & ran. Had she even stopped for 3 seconds to ask if we needed anything else, she could have gotten the second cold glass that was supposed to come with our beverage order. I approached the bar to get said glass and spoke with a guy that looked managerial and let him know. A male bartender was standing behind the \"manager\" the whole time we spoke and within seconds of returning to my table, he flagged down \"Kim\" to tell her what I had said. He was even kind enough to point at our table so she knew exactly who we were. Awesome. \n\nFood was good, as usual. Rude service & poor attitude have turned me off to this place for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is amazing and the happy hour is great too. The place has a hip atmosphere and there is plenty of outside seating. The service is always spot on and quick.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally Cool Spot! A bit of a weight on a Friday night, but it cool that you can have drinks & apps on the patio. Drinks were good and strong. Chips and Salas really good too. Tacos are street style so small in size, large in flavor. If you r hungry, ap and maybe 3 tacos would be perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAY AWAY!!!  my kids took me there for my 45 birthday and they sat us in a booth with so many flies the manager had to come over with BUG SPRAY and spray the window.!! The pesticide was so strong they had to move us to other booth she had just sprayed. There were dead flies everywhere. Needless to say when our food came we had to fight the flies for it. The dessert was horrible, the drinks were garbage and they wouldn't offer to take it back. Not a good bday!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great experience from the sweet hostess (didn't catch her name) that greeted us to the awesome and very attentive server (Joseph). My mom and I came here on a Taco Tuesday where they have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas.  I had the Blood Orange Margarita and my mother had the Prickly Pear (both were delicious).  We both ordered the vegetarian and the beer-battered fish tacos which were very flavorful and PACKED with perfectly balanced ingredients.  I would recommend this place to ANYONE and EVERYONE.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the atmosphere and services, they were so friendly, the food was so delicious and tasty. Now i am writing i was wandering I wanted tacos again. \nI recommend this restaurant you won't be upset:)\n\n\n\n\n\nCheap tacos.  Cheap beer.  Excellent quality of both.  Service was great, I believe the guy behind the bar was Gary.  We will definitely be back again!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tacos & great margaritas!!! Highly recommend & will definitely be back for more!\n\n\n\n\n\nover priced to start with, not traditional\nMexican food, more fusion style.  they poured the mole sauce on the chicken enchiladas and. green chili (salsa Verde) on beef enchiladas.. waiter didn't offer to fix....they used flour tortillas for the tacos so everything was soggy and had no crunch, also no heat it's like Mexican food for people from Iowa...Well margaritas were expensive and the tequila they used was awful.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a nice lunch with various tacos and salad..our complaint...why do they have the music so loud ?  Can't have a conversation without raising your voice...this seems to be common practice in the newer restaurants...can understand at happy hour...but not at lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nWife said she wanted to try Gilbert's Joyride Taco House. \"Taco House,\" I said? \"Meh.\" But holy moly was I wrong. This place is fantastic. We had the chicken and carnita nachos, carne asada tacos, roasted veggies, and finished off the meal with a Mo's Definitely dessert. Everything was delicious and so unique from the other Mexican taco shops in town. Very relaxed place to dine and the service was excellent. We sat outdoors on the patio and they did not try to get us to move along but let us take as much time as we wanted to enjoy the evening. Taylor was our waitress and was so pleasant and helpful that we wanted to adopt her. Anyhow, we will be back for more tacos and are eager to try the other menu temptations. Our only regret is it took us so long to finally stop in and try the place.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhew, it's pricey. $3.50 for a mini taco. Atmosphere is good,  staff is. .. hipster. Chips were a bit stale and my drink was not the best. It cost my husband and I $50 for the 3 mini tacos,  nachos and a drink a piece. The have a really good outdoor area and is great for the young professional but if you go the to eat and not socialize, best to go someplace out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service at the bar was horrible, my boyfriend and I stood there for about 15 minutes without anyone saying we will be with you in a moment, then we saw them pour about 5 beers all with a bunch of foam in them. Once we sat down at the table service was a lot better, the margaritas were really good, the tacos were just alright. I had the tamales, which were delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nachos are amazing. And just generally the food is very good. The staff can be a bit less than friendly and that's really the only thing that keeps me from going there more often. I suppose I've been there 5 times and not once had wait staff that was genuinely friendly or had any sort of humor/personality. Odd considering the groovy style of the place.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love their tacos and just about everything else. This is a chill place to hang out on date night or with friends. Their drinks are delicious too! Highly recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been wanting to try this place... but it's hard when postino's is best door! It was just me and my kiddo (2) and we enjoyed lunch on the patio. Service was great, they seemed to work as a team, it did take my burrito a little longer than expected (carne asada & other deliciousness). I just got the kiddo a said of beans (they were different, topped with some sort of oil??), had I realized they were $4 I would have gone with the $5 kids meal but I didn't think he would eat it all (entree, side & drink - smoking kids meal deal!). I'll bring the husband and six year old next time and give a margarita a try!\n\n\n\n\n\nWonderful tacos, I couldn't decide so I had to taste one of each. This place had a fun atmosphere and I really enjoyed the staff, the location and the food!\n\n\n\n\n\nOk I visited this place twice on my 2 day vaca in Arizona, didn't even want to check other Mexican places. Sorry. Their tacos are to die for. Perfect mix of flavors and the size is decent. They serve free chips and salsa with your order. \nI was not so amazed with margaritas, so sweet! But with a small modification it was just fine. \nGreat happy hour!\nLove the decor.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was craving some Mexican food and was delighted to find this place with all the good reviews! There were four of us that ended up going on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed but we got a table right away. As soon as we sat down we received water and chips and salsa. I have never received such prompt service. We had not even been there thirty seconds! So far, I LOVED this place. Nothing worse then waiting for water in the summertime (ok it was Sept but still felt like summer) in AZ. The waitstaff was fantastic. They were friendly and prompt which is a great combo! Our group ordered two \"Garden Variety Burritos\" (one with no mushrooms ewwww) and two of \"the Beasts.'\" It was fantastic. I was worried there would be too much salt in the food since I have experienced that in the past at other establishments that serve Mexican food. I was pleasantly surprised. It was seasoned to perfection and no one had any complaints. I will defiantly be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered their chicken Tinga tacos the first time I went because I had yet to find a good version of pollo Tinga in az.  They were a little bland despite warnings that they were spicy.  However, once I added some of their salsa to them they were good chicken tacos.  I like their decor.  I have eaten their once alone at the bar and the service was quick and super friendly and once with friends during the busy Christmas season... Service was a little slower but food was great and waiter was fun.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want to shed light to the fact that this upward projects restaraunt concept is a complete ripoff of Gallo Blanco. I heard about this place through a friend who works at the gilbert location, they described it as one of AZ's \"best Mexican fine dining places.\" Having previously worked for Gallo, I was curious about this new place I had never heard of before, but was apparently such a huge deal. So I did a little investigating. Much to my dismay, upon discovery of their menu I realized that many of the names of food dishes, even exact recipies had been stolen from Gallo Blanco. I can say this with 100% confidence because if you know anything about Gallo Blanco's owner, you would know that he is from Mecixo, he is a prominent chef, and his menu items are either entirely self-created, or as a collaboration with somebody who works for/with him. His food is authentic to Mexico City as you will get this side of the border. So you see how it might have come as a shock when I noticed items on Joyride's menu like steamed jasmine rice with tomatillo salsa as a garnish: this item was on the menu at Gallo Blanco for 4 years because the owner's mother (who is of partial Japanese descent) would serve rice to him in that way when he was growing up in Mexico. Tsktsk Joyride, I see what you're doing.\n It's not about competing restaraunts,I'm sure that Joyride Central will come to it's own success as Gallo continues to grow, I'm just upset to have stumbled upon such an ugly expose of how people choose to make money. I've been a patron at Windsor, Postino, and Federal Pizza on numerous occasions; Upward must be doing something right, and making a lot of money doing it. But this Joyride thing is low, and upward people should be ashmed that rather than develop a creative food idea for themselves, they'd rather hire a good interior decorator, steal food concepts, and try to out-compete the original creator of the ideas they are attempting to capitalize on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is hip and the food is awesome! The battered and fried fish tacos are the best I have ever had. These are no regular fish tacos though, they are high end and will cost you. I especially like that this restaurant has agua fresca alcoholic free type beverages for those who don't partake in bar offerings. I have tried the carne asada, grilled fish, chicken tinga tacos as well, but the best are the deep fried fish ones. Order up 3 with some rice and beans and get ready for fish taco heaven.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here on a tip and was thoroughly impressed. \n\nWhen we arrived we were told of 2 available seats at the front of the bar which we gladly accepted. The atmosphere was very social and lively, a little loud but perfect for a Friday night. After ordering our drinks and looking over the menu, our server/barkeep informed us of the special they were serving. Slow roasted pork shoulder on a bed of sweet polenta, garnished with what tasted like pickled jalapeos and some sort of adobo sauce and cilantro. What ever it was it tasted like heaven, with huge complex flavors. The pork melted in your mouth, it was unreal. \n\nThe staff was very nice and even engaged us in light conversation which just added to the laid back ambience. When we finished eating we were approached by the manager and asked what we thought about the special. I relayed my enthusiasm and he said it was really nice to get positive feedback on non-menued dishes and would be serving more 1-offs in the future.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience. We will definitely return soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went in during happy hour on a friday.  Love the atmosphere and how it is open to outside.  We tried the tacos, they are $2 each during happy hour.  The standard was the best one, wish I would have gotten all 3 standards!  Kids meal was good, my daughter loved the quesadilla and beans.  The service was awful!  Had to wait 15 minutes for a check and finally had to flag down a person.  You can't tell who works there because no one wears uniforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visit here almost every Tuesday for taco Tuesday and we have 2 to 3 people with us last night we had 7 we bragged about this place it was horrible 1st we were told an hour then it was actually 15 min we almost left then after waiting 20 min for our waiter chase? He got all of our orders wrong the carne asada was burnt another waitress who is really good admitted they were burning the meat he had to come back 4 or 5 times to correct items never did apologize or anything we were going almost every week but after this and now looking like idiots in front of of friends and new clients I think now you have lost everyone it's too bad it was good for awhile\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely not the friendliest place. Won't ever be back. I had green veggie leaf in my drink and the bartender said it's just cilantro. I was sitting at the bar not having Mexican food. I obviously made the bartender upset when I ask for a new drink. When we sat at bar it was obvious that I wasn't welcomed. I NEVER NEVER use the race card but this was undeniable!!! Bad bad bad!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best taco house! We are regulars, visiting every Saturday for lunch for $5 pitchers of beer and $5 pineapple mojitos. Our waitresses/editors always have out drink order memorized. We love the carne tacos, chicken tinga tacos, Mexican street corn and the cheesy mas to start. Our daughter loves the Virgin prickly pear lemonade.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love  $2 taco Tuesday!  I want to give more stars, but honestly, every time I'm here, I've had to yell to speak to the people at my table. The music is SO loud! ! Also, the waiter never resumed my water!\n\n\n\n\n\nI DON'T GET IT? This place was packed was everybody in there a first timer. The food not only was straight up bad but it is sooooo over priced! The service was just as bad as the food, you will dehydrate waiting for something to drink but don't order ice-tea unless you like fufu fruity flavors. When it finely did come I ask why he did not tell me that's the only flavor they serve? I was told no one has ever questioned it before WOW I guess it not questioned because your so thirsty by time it comes you will drink anything??? However my water did come out just in time for my ice cold food.. They get the 1 star from me for nothing but the atmosphere. But if you want a good Taco go ANYWHERE else!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nStill working out the bugs??? Undercooked rice, SMALL tacos for the price....Not sure this place will last....We won't be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI traveled from San Tan Valley to eat with my wife and son, also joining us was my buddy and his wife and son.  we first ordered drinks. the horchata was at best not what i would call horchata. we also ordered jamaica which they call hibiscus another disappointing drink .  the lemonade was ok. the salsa was failed attempt as was the chips.  four dollars for street tacos and no sides you have got to be kidding me. we decided to leave before we got ripped off, our bill for just  four drinks came to about $18.50. we will not return.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the tacos here! Husband & I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Went out for dinner with our friends & we will all be coming back soon. Margaritas we're delicious! Salsa that comes out with the chips is pretty spicy. My husband was impressed by the selection of craft beers available since he was expecting domestic drafts & corona. My only minor issue was sitting out on the patio and not being able to read the menu because the lighting isn't that great. I would love to see some cute and festive patio lights strung across the patio!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tacos are tiny, but they get you full really fast, excellent service and very nice staff, Taylor was our waitress she was very nice and helpful, she was explaining the menu, and was very excited to serve us.\n\n\n\n\n\nPacked and for good reason.. Went for taco Tuesday and great prices on a variety of tacos ($2) and margaritas. Best taco is carnitas, best margarita is the pear.. Just my humble opinion.\n\nGreat atmosphere and feels a bit like old town Scottsdale, except that the bartenders and staff actually give a crap about their patrons.\n\nCome and see for yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here once during lunch and once for dinner.  Dinner time it was pretty crowded with a little bit of a wait, but we were able to sit at the bar and eat there right away.  We got a few tacos which were unique and I love the little taco holders.  We ordered dessert and I don't remember what my friend got but it looked delicious but I had the churros and they were excellent. This might make a regular place to eat for me\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off I would like to say if you haven't been to downtown Gilbert in a while you need to. It has become a hip little restaurant row.  A few years ago I moved away from Arizona to foodie heaven a.k.a. Portland, OR. Being from Arizona originally I would have to say that the one thing Portland cannot seem to replicate correctly is Mexican food. So coming back to visit tacos are an essential must eat. \nA friend suggested we head over to Joyride Tacos and I'm sure glad she did. Every sip and bite was delicious! They had both a front and back patio with plenty of seating. Being a beautiful sunny, 70 degree day we choose to sit out front. While I was waiting for my guest, the waiter promptly brought out chips and salsa, then took my drink order. They have about 6 aqua frescas to choose from which you can get with or without alcohol. I choose the almond horchata, oh man was it good! They serve it with a little bit of ground cinnamon sugar and nuts on top and that gives it an amazing texture. The chips were crisp and tasted like they had been fried fresh that morning. The salsa was spicy yet fresh. So don't be afraid to dig in just because you can't handle heat. When my friend arrived we ordered a couple tacos each. I got both a chicken and shredded beef taco, both came with and assortment of cheese and veggies on top, including avocado. I ate my chicken taco first which was very tasty, but the beef taco was by far superb. You could literally taste the smokey goodness in every bite of the taco and the creamy avocado was a perfect accent to the meat. Oh and because the two of us ordered more then 3 tacos we received a free side dish! We choose the black beans and they were better then any black beans I have ever had before. Overall I will be heading back to Joyride Tacos at least once every trip back to AZ!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the hype, Taco Tuesday was a let down primarily due to the service. They have the same happy hour every day of the week from 2pm - 6pm; special $2 taco selections and $5 drinks. \n\nWe arrived just after 5 pm and were told a 30 minute wait (it was busy). We were told that the patio seating would move faster, so we opted for that and were sat within 10 minutes...YAY!\n\nIt took a while for our server to take our initial order; we ordered both our drinks and tacos at that time. Sadly after about 15 minutes, we still didn't have drinks yet our food was arriving. Halfway through our meal our drinks FINALLY arrived. \n\nWe wanted to order another round of drinks, yet we couldn't flag anyone down from the staff. Guess that was our queue to leave.\n\nWhile I understand that flies outside on a patio can't be avoided, not bussing a table is something they can easily do to keep them at bay. We ended up waiting 25 minutes after we were done eating/drinking before our final bill arrived...all the while shooing flies away from our table as our plates were never cleared. We finally moved the plates to an empty table that freed up next to us.  At one time we counted 12 flies sitting on one of our bowls. GROSS!\n\nWhile the food was average, the service from ordering to drink delivery and clean-up was disappointing. The portions were average for the $2 price point, but I would be disappointed if I were to pay full price for the amount of meat that was on each item.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a great time being checked on by 4 different employees just sitting at the bar. The bartender was friendly and helpful when deciding on what to order to eat. His name was Alex and made sure everything came out quickly and to perfection\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely amazing tacos!! And that side dish of the cucumber and orange salad is to die for!!! Their ceviche is very good! Their agua frescas are so freshing!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood tacos. Good margaritas. The horchata with amaretto is yummy. Get the Mexican street corn. Bomb.\n\n\n\n\n\nYummy yummy margaritas. Oh my goodness, we spend $25 just for drinks ($5 each) hahaha. They don't skimp on alcohol or flavor in the drinks. The tacos are great, but seem a bit small, especially when they're full price ($3.50-$4.50). Although, the sides are huge and hearty! Your pocketbook will thank you if you come in when the tacos are $2 though. They really do have great service here, everyone was eager to help us. No one said \"this isn't my section/table/job\". I've been here before and I'm sure I'll come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe eat and drink here at least once a week. \n\nExcellent margaritas - STRONG. \n\nGo on Taco Tuesday so you can get the STRONG margaritas for $5!\n\nVeggie taco is a game changer. \n\nMexican street corn is out of this world and the queso reminds me of Texas - where the best queso is found. \n\nOh, and did I mention that the service is fantastic. Excellent service.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst \nTaco's 5 stars. Healthy and flavorful. \nWhile I would like more sauce. \nService 5 stars. \nBeer. 2 stars.  Kinda warmish\nWife ordered a rum relaxer. ( recipe online or on any smartphone search)\n1 star.  Wasn't even close. \nAmbiance 5 stars \nIn and out fast. \n\nI particularly liked that you don't get service from only ONE server \nAnyone walking by helps you out.  It results in chips, beer , guac, showing up faster.  \nThat alone  earned them an ample tip. \n\nSlight disappointments. \n\nBeer temperature and taco juiciness.\n\n\n\n\n\nFunky decor; friendly, fast service. Like the casual atmosphere & open, airy dining room which is great on a nice day. Great salsa. If you're looking for untraditional flavors this is the place to go. We ordered carne tacos, quesadilla and chicken salad. Carne was sweet, which was interesting. Chicken wasn't all that great - I would almost score this place a 4 but chicken ruined it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've gone here maybe 3 times and each time was great. I love their taco selection. The battered fish one is my favorite. I love their agua frescas as well! They are a must have! Spike the horchata one if you want an adult beverage! Service has always been on point. One time I went where there was a long wait and employees came around asking us if we wanted waters or appetizers while waiting. That's a great business for you!\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Taco Tuesday place. The tacos are a must try. The patio is is nice. Inside is cramped.\n\n\n\n\n\n$5 margaritas on a Sunday afternoon?  Yes please! Very cool place with a nice vibe. Busy place with delicious food.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was awesome! The food was really well made and our server Jon was by far one of the best food establishment food servers I have ever had! Professional, timely (even in the packed restaurant), and always smiling. I will definitely return and highly recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only did they decide to raise their prices they now charge for chips and salsa after the first basket and when ordering 3 tacos you don't get the side for free anymore, extra $1 for the side.  Subpar sevice on top of it!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is good- the prices are only good on taco Tuesday but even then it's not really worth the wait. Didn't quite understand why we had to wait as long as we did (1 hour) when we walked past 8 empty tables before being seated outside. We did say we were fine with first available, but there were 4 or 5 open tables inside. There were plenty of open seats and still people waiting\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a little disappointed that they have changed their food and drink menu. The Key Largo was epic and now it's gone. And they have gotten rid of a lot of their yummy fresh fruit garnishes. Also not happy with the seasoning on the cucumber side salad. \nIf it ain't broke don't fix it!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is ridiculously awesome great atmosphere!!! Good music and bartender Daniel took great care of us even though it was a full bar all of our food and drinks were on point this is the taco Tuesday spot !!! Try allthere specials you won't regret it\n\n\n\n\n\nGluten free eater here. \n\nAtmosphere. It is busy here on a Saturday afternoon. A smaller venue with loud music and a lot of people. A hip location. Could have quieter music to allow for good conversation. The colours inside are vibrant and cheerful. \n\nFood. The chips and salsa is my first indication of a good restaurant. The salsa was good. But the chips were too salty. I could tell they were fresh but the salted powder or something on it was a little too strong. \n\nOut tacos were decent. With a sensitive stomach we came our ahead. It was worth the stop. We got a variety of tacos to try. Nothing stood out but it was hearty.\n\n\n\n\n\nWonderful food & drinks! I'm not sure which taco was my favorite. Perhaps the Chicken Tinga. Or maybe the Standard. Or maybe the Veggie. Oh, and don't get me started on the salsa...\n\n\n\n\n\nHad dinner with my bestie today it was awesome! My phone was dying and Alex moved us to a booth with an outlet lol super rad thank you guys\n\n\n\n\n\nVery good contemporary Mexican cuisine.\n\nMy FIL was visiting and was craving for some Mexican food. We decided to check this place out.  Very airy and open, perfect for the weather we're having at this moment.  Pineapple Mojito caught my eyes even before I decided on my food, which was a little too sweet for my taste.  Hubby ordered The Bandit (chicken, carne asada, cochinita pilbil plate).  FIL had The Beast carne asada and bean burrito.  Both paired their food with Stella.  To go with my Mojito, Vegetarian and Goat cheese enchilada with salsa verde and ancho chile sauce was a perfect fit.  My little cutie pie had his usual quesadilla and fresh lemonade.    No room for any dessert.  We do want to try their churro with chocolate dip next time around.\n\nThe service was impeccable!  Everyone seemed like they enjoy working there.  The manager came by to ask how everything was.  It was very good, thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are an actual Latino. Then this is not the place for you. Its a nice place and the way the food is made looks good but there is no taste to it. My girlfriend and I went here because we heard it was good. The chips and salsa are good but the food was disgusting. I ordered chilaquiles and my girlfriend ordered inchiladas. They both looked amazing when they were brought up to the table so I can tell we have a good professional Chef in the kitchen but when we went to eating the food there was no flavor what so ever. The only flavor was the green sauce covering it. \nThe people seemed nice but there was one waiter that was very rude and made a mess as he kept filling our waters. not professional at all. \nAs I said if you are a Latino looking for some real Mexican food then this is the wrong place for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame in for a little date night cocktails. Sat at the bar for fantastic service and enjoyed our drinks but the best part was the food. \nDeliciousness ahi ceviche, guacamole and perfect chips. Finished the night off with El Domingo... A heavenly concoction OD vanilla ice cream, caramel, caramelized pineapple and malted corn flakes. Oh My!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nService was pretty good, spilled salsa and it was cleaned right away. Ordered a non alcoholic beverage (underage) and waitress brought a mojito Fresca drink. Chips were good, guacamole okay. Fish tacos had no flavor. Even tasted gross and overly fishy. I either think everyone giving 5 stars has really bad taste and doesnt know what a good fish taco tastes like, or my fish taco was bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere, cool design and layout digging the hipster look. The chips and salsa where awesome, salsa had a nice kick and the chips weren't those cheap chips. The highlight of the night was the awesome battered fish taco and shrimp taco and Im not a big fan of seafood, job well done, great flavor with an awesome corn tortilla, also, the carne asada taco was incredibly cooked but i could do without the sweet tasting salsa, however thats just my opinion. Definitely coming back here!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is horrible, I don't know what the hype, on any level is about. My family and I went there this evening as a recommendation as one of the top 5 places in Gilbert, hardly! Our food was cold, my Sons soda was flat after two tries of two different kinds and it was still on the bill, the waitress reached right across my face mid bite to take my Sons plate away, the portions were ridiculous for a $5.00 street taco, the carne asada taco tasted like it should have been a hawaiian taco, the shrimp taco..what shrimp, the guacamole was bland, the chips were stale, the margarita was weak, the beans were runny, the grilled vegetables were cold with a blob of tomato paste thrown atop; the meal all around for a family of 4 @ $80.00 was HORRIBLE!!! We will never ever go back. Disappointing and unsatisfied is a mere understatement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwful service. Came here before my bridal appt to celebrate with a friend and was unimpressed to say the least. \nWe asked for drinks with a small amount of alcohol and got the exact opposite. \nWe ordered food at 6:05 and after taking our order the server avoided our table at all costs. Party of 6 came in at 6:20 and sat behind us. They received their food at 6:42. \nAt 6:45 we still hadn't seen our server or our food. We excused ourselves from the table and proceeded to walk out the door. \nWe had our bridal appointment at 7 and couldn't wait any longer. As we were leaving we stopped the hostess and informed her that we were leaving and I left $20 on the table for our drinks. Didn't receive an apology or anything. \nAbsolutely disgusted and now more hungry than ever\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time in for dinner before my sisters graduation. I really enjoyed the decor. The burrito I ordered was surprisingly larger than I expected although it was pretty difficult to eat but a fork helped with that. Only complaint really is the tight space and the music was way too loud. Almost had to yell across the table. Otherwise good, I'll be back at some point to try some tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place!  from the food to the drinks to the service, this place is great in every way.  We have taken friends and family from out of town and everyone seems to always enjoy the experience.  Highly recommend.  Kid friendly too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is good and the $5 alcohol special is nice. The tacos are really solid, but pricey for how small they are.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have gone to Joyride couple of times with my bf and it's always an amazing experience. The salsa is a very good start (the best salsa i ever had i guess). I ordered 3 different kinds of tacos and all are fantastic in their own rights. The staffs are friendly and accommodating too.. We will go visit again for sure\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a great night with friends and Tim was a great server! Great drinks and food. Dessert too!\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp & Veggie Tacos with Mango Mandarin Margarita! Highly recommended! Everything was on happy hour menu besides the shrimp taco.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place to have a quick bite and a beer only if you're sitting at the bar otherwise you're going to have a long wait\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recently had a late night light dinner at Joyride. The combination of great food and service made our evening. We enjoyed the variety of the Tacos to choose from and the fresh sides were a hit with everyone. My favorites were the shrimp tacos and the chips and salsa.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a taco house commands this type of price tag, I except very very good food, and we gave it a chance.. \n\nWe noticed immediately that the waiter was very attentive and they kept refilling our cups every 2 seconds... that's good I guess, but it's a little distracting. Even though I'm not a very big person (at least that's what I think), there was not much elbow or table room. Almost a little crowded for me. For dinner time, the music can be a little higher than the normal 'family' restaurant, but I love the music selection! Lots of good rock with a mix of dance. I can see myself and a few friends hanging out here for drinks, but probably not bring the 3 year old back.\n\nThe nacho app platter is probably going to be our favorite.. it was plentiful! The rotisserie chicken juicy and tender, fresh and full of flavor. Very soft to cut, and easily pulled apart. The eggplant/veggie mix and lime rice that it came with were to die for.. very light and delicious. Just enough spice. Hubs had the horchata, steak burrito and grilled fish taco, in which he said was delicious. Kiddo had the quesadilla kid's meal.. Food is definitely more elevated than other 'gourmet' mexican food restaurants.\n\nAll came to was $65 for 2.5 people. Tasty food, lively and interesting decor, but pricey food if you don't mind that.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Bloody Mary...nice and clean place.fish tacos not so great.rice was mush and bla.if your just having drinks great food not so much. Very nice workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nK and I visited this place a long time ago,  a couple weeks after they opened. We sat at the bar and let's just say, did not have the best experience. Tonight I met S, one of my AOB buds. He drove down from Scottsdale for his BDay and Joyride was his choice. \nWe got sat right away only because a table opened up. The place was otherwise full. Our server was Midori. She was awesome. She was attentive but not intrusive.\nJoyride is of course a member of the Upward Project family. Postino, Churn, The Windsor and Federal Pizza. This doesn't guarantee Joyride will be good but it does give it a head start. The menu consists of Appetizers, soups & salads, Taco's 11 ways, Burritos 4 ways, Chilaquiles and Enchiladas. Margaritas, beer & wine, Aguas Frescas plus various Tequilas. \nS and I started with a couple of margaritas. ($9 ea) S got the Prickly Pear and I got the Blood Orange. My Blood Orange margarita, made with Tequila, Triple Sec, Blood Orange sour and Hibiscus syrup was really tasty. The blood orange flavor stood out but was not overwhelming.\nS ordered The Beast Burrito ($10). It was filled with Carne Asada, Pinto Beans, Avocado and salsa. S enjoyed his burrito and said it was quite good.\nI ordered the Garden Variety Burrito ($8 + $2 for Red & Green sauce). This was seriously the best veggie burrito I have ever had. This thing was stuffed with Butternut and Chayote Squash, Spinach, Mushroom, Avocado, Corn, Queso, Tomatillo salsa, White Magic and Pico gringo. I could taste everything inside the tortilla. All the flavors mingled perfectly with each other. Now, I did order this with the red and green sauce. This was a recommendation from Midori. She was spot on. The sauce elevated this burrito to another level. Winner winner veggie burrito dinner.\nI did find a couple things that were no bueno. Their website says Happy Hour ends at 5pm. Midori said it ended at 6. It was after 6 so it didn't really matter either way but one of them was wrong. Hopefully it's the website because ending Happy Hour at 5pm would be a joke. Another thing that was not the best was the acoustics of the dining room. Why would the Upward Project design an interior that basically causes ALL the sounds to bounce around making it very hard to hear anything. Not impressed with that but the rest of the design is great.\nI would also like to add that the music that was playing was great. Dion and the Belmonts and The Beastie Boys to name a couple.\nGreat margarita, great food, great server, fair prices, great background music, lousy acoustics. 4 Stars\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere with great tacos. Awesome service by Natalie.We tried the standard taco and couldn't have been happier with the unique and delicious taste.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is great! Service is awesome. Loved their burrito and the constant free refills. Pricing is a little steep though. Still, recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy Mexican food, not real authentic but not bad, just different. Great atmosphere, sort of pricey though.\n   Doesn't make it in to my regular rotation of restaurants but I probably will stop in 2-3 times per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen dying for the $5 cocktail deal lately and ended up taking a chance on lunch today, and it was glorious. I went for the tacos this time and while they ain't cheap, I wouldn't call them overpriced for the quality. The Pork Adovada, Braised Beef, and Crispy Fish were all scrummy (the latter two a bit more than the first), and the cucumber orange salad we ordered alongside was very near to perfect (they should cut the cukes a bit smaller). We also got the veggie burrito (whatever it's called) sans rice, and it was so frickin good, our eyes were rolling back in our heads. We were sweet talked into dessert and got the churros, a little too much sugar on them but they were so so good.\n\nWe got out of there for $42 bucks before tip for all of that and two happy hour cocktails. Very reasonable for such a flavor-packed meal, with succinct but personable, knowledgable, and speedy service, and of course the energetic atmosphere. I'll definitely start coming here more often.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like sea food this is your thing! I got shrimp with fries, I would go back for it!\n\n\n\n\n\nI absolutely LOVE this place. Downtown Gilbert has really needed a place that can make a good cocktail. The Mazaltan Mule and Pineapple Mojito are especially delicious. The food has been excellent. Wonderful tacos filled with very fresh fish or tender meat. The Rotisserie chicken is a very nice take on a classic American dinner. The staff is one of the shining points of this restaurant. All the bartenders are more than happy to serve up exotic libations with a smile.  joyride is a very welcome addition to downtown.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, so my family and I went here for lunch today (Saturday) for the first time. We got there just before 1:30pm and we were seated right away even though 5 minutes earlier when I called them on the phone to see if there was a wait, the guy who answered told me there was a 20 to 25 minute wait. What's up with that? \n\nSo we had no less than 5 different servers. They were all nice, hipster types but the girl that took our drink order never came back so I had to flag down the next random person to place our order. We got 4 different tacos (the carne asada, shrimp, crunchy fish, and grilled fish) to split between me and my son, my husband got the tamale plate, and we ordered the kids quesadilla for my 1 year old. Thankfully, the quesadilla came out first because the baby was getting antsy. As for the rest of our food, it took FOREVER to come out. In the meantime, we were munching on the chips and salsa. The salsa was good although the chips were NOT. But we were starving so we had no other choice.\n\nWhen we finally got our food, it was good. But honestly, the gourmet tacos at Rubio's are way better and way more filling for less than the price they are here. We would have ordered more food but it was so expensive, we felt it wasn't worth the money or ungodly time it would take for another order to come out. We did, however, order the churros for dessert. They came out fairly quickly and were good and came with melted chocolate for dipping. \n\nSo when we asked for the bill, they brought it to us on a clothespin! Basically it was the receipt and a clothespin which my husband and I thought was pretty weird but funny. However, the amount we had to pay for such little food was NOT funny at all... It was just over $60!!! Yikes! So not worth it!\n\nSo if you're a trendy hipster living in the burbs with cash to burn this place is definitely for you! My family and I will stick to Rubio's. Definitely won't be coming back to this overrated joint.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe come here far to often.  With that said the service is always good and food and drinks are great!  But until they bring the coconut Margarita back i can not in good faith issue a 4 star rating.  Spoke with the waitress tonight and I'm not the only one who feels this way.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended by friends, first experience wasn't great.  Will try again to compare.  Service was ok, messed up some orders.  Seemed to have a good atmosphere.  Hopefully we caught it on a bad night.\n\n\n\n\n\nGilbert definitely has a new spicy hot spot, Joyride Taco House complete with festive decor with a relaxed and friendly atomosphere! I joined friends and family on opening night 7 in all, Justin our waiter handled us like a pro. Not only was he a good waiter but everytime I blinked there was someone at our table with water, drink refills or clearing our table asking us if we needed anything else, they rock the team work attitude!  From the homemade chips & fireroasted salsa of which we devoured 3-4 helpings to the tasty chicken tinga, shrimp & scallop tacos,chicken nachos,machaca burritos, empanadas and El Domingo dessert with carmelized pineapple, caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream we finished every tasty bite! \nAn extra thank you for replacing my picky princesses taco, which came with beans she wasn't willing to eat, once the beans were gone so was her taco! Happy kid, happpy Mom!\nThis is the place to go to add a little spice in your foodie life! I'm looking forward to going back to try the variety of drinks and dive into the charred habenero \"melt your face\" salsa! Oh yes, and more chips please!\n\n\n\n\n\nMyself and my fiancs family are from New York.\nWhatever you do don't pass up this place. \n\nWe stopped here for the happy hour, weekdays 2-6 2$ tacos 5$ margaritas and pitchers of beer ( beer till 5pm), same thing on Tuesdays, 2pm- closing. We as a family feel this place was a solid 4 stars, good service, good food, come here for happy hour. \n\nIf you're not into spicy food, ask how spicy everything is. The salsa was hot but really good to me, totally burning to the rest of the family. If you want a taco and are sensitive to heat, get the crispy fish taco, or chicken burrito.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was there today with my 4 year old daughter, and it once again reaffirmed the fact that this place is way over-rated. Their food is good (not great) and is seemingly overpriced. \n\nLuckily today, being mid afternoon on a Sunday, there was absolutely no wait. There was plenty of seating inside and outside. Considering it was not extremely busy, it seemed less of an excuse to receive absolutely crappy service. \n\nWe probably waited 10-15 minutes to get a drink order, and by that time my daughter was getting restless. We ordered drinks and our meals, and it came out rather quickly. The server gave my daughter the wrong drink and then messed up her order. Ok, not a huge deal. \n\nMy daughter was getting tired so I was holding her, and I asked for boxes to take my food home. He gave me the boxes and the check and then leaves. Someone with some common sense would've at least offered to help me with the food and the boxes considering I was holding my child. As I'm leaving, no \"thank you\" or \"have a good day\" (not even from the hostess as we were walking out the front door.) I probably will not go back there again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this post is to have the company recognize Kameron! He was an excellent waiter and helped us make decisions! This was our first time to Joyride, so my wife and I were asking questions left and right about the menu. Kameron answered our questions confidently and made sure we had a great meal. The food was excellent and we will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's meh. I'm not a huge fan of the tortillas they use for their tacos. The meats are so-so. I'd rather hit my local taco shop to avoid the wait and the prices here. The margaritas were very good and compensated for the lack luster food.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent in January for my birthday lunch.Loved the laid back vibe, especially compared to Postino next door. Skinny margaritas was fantastic!!! Got a taco combo and split with the hubby crispy fish, baja fish and the standard side of black beans and a carnita taco. Would skip the crispy fish next time, beans were ok. Others were above average but the soft corn tortillas get messy fast so eat quickly. Another upward project success story.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll start off with the horrible seating process which starts off with a 45min wait for NO reason. We arrived on a Friday night about 7:30pm and had a seat at the bar until a table was ready. As we looked around, there was easily 6 tables and a booth available for patrons. The hostesses just keep chatting amongst themselves and then they'd call all seven parties at once causing a huge cluster at the front. You'd think they would keep the flow moving and sit parties as guests leave? My biggest gripe was that they nickel and dime you for literally everything! You are limited to one basket of free chips and salsa then you are charged for more- want hotter salsa... upcharge of $3! Want more red sauce on the burrito you already paid an upcharge on for enchilada style... $3 more! I was super disappointed with the burrito which was very dry. I'll admit the black beans and cheese y mas appetizer were amazing though. Add in the horrible parking situation and I won't be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has better tacos than its neighbor barrio queen. I recommend \"the standard\", just a solid taco, yummy. Bartenders were nice. Kind of small dining area so if you're claustrophobic, it may be a turn off. It's also always super packed and busy. Only been here once so I will update with future visits.\n\n\n\n\n\nCucumber mint agua freasca... Enough said\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I'm ever on Gilbert Road starving to death, and Postino/Joe's BBQ/Liberty Market/SoCal Fish Taco Co. are otherwise unavailable, I would return. Absolutely nothing to write home about here. The carne asada was meh.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride, what are you doing? I was just about to update my review to reflect a much more positive experience but you had to go and let me down again. \n\nI'm way happier with your food. Garden Variety Burrito is so delicious with the roasted mushrooms, squash, spinach, tomatoes, and corn combined with avocado, queso and \"magic\" sauce make the burrito just the right amount of healthy-unhealthy, especially if you get it chime style. I'd highly suggest getting it chime style or enchilada style by adding red/green sauce. And you give unlimited chips -- Yes, please!!\n\nHowever, amazing food can be over shadowed.  On 5/30/15 in the \"Gals\" bathroom around 1:30-ish pm, the body of one little Ms. Coc K. Roach was not laid to rest. She was on her back, legs in the air, with no life left for anyone who used the bathroom to see. That's a pretty fast way to make someone lose an appetite. So gross! Check those bathrooms! \n\nThe service is finally solid with servers who are knowledgable about the menu and attentive. The food is pretty good but dead bugs in a restaurant, even in a bathroom, is something I would think should be top priority to get under control. They usually say \"If there is one bug then there is...\"\n \nAnd as per usual, splitting and getting the check proved to be difficult. Why don't you want to take our money? Please, I really do want to pay for my food and I typically like to do so in a timely fashion.  \n\nI hold out hope that one day this review can be sunshine and rainbows but for now it's meh and dead bugs. Sad times, JR.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is amazing.  And healthy! I had the nutty cabra salad with chicken and it was wonderful! !!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food! Not the best customer service. I've been three times and each time the waiter has forgotten something I've ordered. Will go again just for the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, wow. First off, the service was phenomenal. Thank you Breezy for such a wonderful, helpful, and attentive personality. Secondly.. the food. The fish tacos. Yup, don't question it, don't argue it, don't even be hesitant. (Because I was a bit.. something about fish tacos always sorta made me worried of trying it) - Absolutely the best taco of the 3 I tried. Sorta sad, I almost don't remember the other 2. A chicken adobo, and some pork one? Both really great as well, but that fish taco. Yup, its a winner. If you're looking for a good app, go with their street corn. It was tender, and crazy delicious! Their margaritas are fantastic, and their super hot salsa, didn't melt my face like it claims, but was spicy, and fantastic. Ask for Breezy, she is a rock star. The only disappointment with this place, is that it doesn't exist in Kansas, which is where I live.. which is awful.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing.  Food is excellent quality and great prices.  I had a taco plate and meat was tender and flavorful.  Margaritas were perfectly balanced and refreshing.  Will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\n1 star because I can't put zero!! Not worth the price nor the experience. Staff is mostly rude and really don't want to be there, management on this place is practically non existent just by noticing how the staff behaves. The bartender we had was the worst, we ordered some drinks at the bar to celebrate my wife's birthday and he starts to ask questions, if we've been drinking previously. No, we where having a good time laughing and celebrating, he decides to just serve us juice and charge us for the alcohol! I don't know if he thought we were idiots, being rude and disrespectful was the tipping point. I'm surely never going back and I recommend everyone to stay away from that place. Thank you for ruining our night I hope it was worth it! A business that supports that kind of behavior, discriminating and judgmental against customers, they definitely don't deserve even one star.\n\n\n\n\n\nShoutout to Manager Miriam for being SO thoughtful.. she overheard i was a vegetarian and catered to my needs without me even asking! Also the hostess Olivia was very friendly sweet and made me love this restaurant before i even sat down! It was my first time here and i will 100% be coming back :) 10/10!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've seen better street tacos and service at Taco Bell. This place is extremely overrated and your better off heading to one of the other restaurants in the area.  Very over priced for the quality of the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place, food, service and employees all Rock! One of the managers (Chandler) always goes above and beyond... as do his employees. I highly recommend the tacos or just hanging out there for Sunday bloody Mary's!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shop is in the same building as postinos but on the other side.  It took me a little whille to find it, but the shop itself is very cute.  The interior looks like a scrapbook with bright patterns on the walls. \n\nAs for the food, each table is served up a dish of awesome salsa and chips as they are seated.  The tacos are about 4 dollars each.  Today I tried the Ahi tuna and the grilled fish.  Both had good flavors and were very unique, however, the Ahi was a little sweet and the grilled fish lacked a bit of a kick.  My friend said taco with cotija was also very good, and I plan to try it the next time a go. Two tacos was a bit small, so I'd recommend ordering a bit more, unless you plan on getting dessert (which I did of course).  \n\nFor dessert, I was craving chocolate, so I ordered the churros con chocolate.  For $6 I would say that the dessert was unimpressive.  The churros were coated in cinnamon and sugar, which really overpower the chocolate (which was also too thick and not heated enough to be a smooth dip).\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Wife and I decided to try out this place of a so call street taco.  The name Joyride says it!  they will take you for a joy ride on there so call tacos.  Im not going to pay 4 dollars for a taco with no sides.  The drinks are horrible.  Salsa is mushed up with who knows what.  Everything on the menu is so discrimintive.  Why GRINGO?  or is this place is only for whites.  I wouldnt eat here ever.  If you want good street tacos, go to a real mexican resturant, at least youll get sides with it and real food.  If there were a choice on the star, I would not even give one.  Horrible.  never eat at joy ride again.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas a little turned off by the snobby hipster waiter serving us drinks while we were waiting an hour for a table but a friendly young lady helped,  and ultimately the wait staff and Food made up for the bad wait.  The drinks were refreshing and different,  we had a mix of quesadillas and guacamole appetizers,  both delicious and the fish and carne asada tacos were delicious and filling.  My next visit will be earlier to cash in on the happy hour specials, I will be back for sure...\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tacos and TUES nights they have the deal for I believe, $2 tacos? Its been a few weeks since I've been.  BUT it is CROWDED on that night of course so be advised.  Good to great service both times I visited, fair prices even on non promo days.  My only critiques are, the prickly pear marg is GROSS I'm sorry it is just nasty, and I have no idea why refried black beans are a thing here.  When I ordered the black beans, I was not told they were refried and mushed to death.  They were too salty or....SOMETHING I'm not sure what I tasted but NO don't do it.  Black beans are best with salt, citrus, and left whole.  No need to be overly fancy.  GREAT tacos though, good salsa, pretty decent guac although its the one thing on the menu that is overpriced for the portion you get.\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG their tacos are so delish and they have this drink with lime and coconut that is to die for!\n\n\n\n\n\nJust moved to the area and haven't got to visit any local restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area until Saturday 10/10. We came across this location as we were in the mood for some Mexican food. \nFairly busy at about 3:30 in the afternoon which made it seem to us, like it was a pretty popular hang out for the locals. I'd say the atmosphere is like a retro, chic, cool contemporary concept throughout this restaurant. From the style & theme/ to the menu they offer, it's different ( in a really good way).\nOur server was Breezy, With an adorable flower head band & all: She was pleasant, fun and informative. \nWe first thought there wasn't much to the menu, that was until we tried the food- WOW!!\nHappy Hour was going on-so all draft beers by the pitcher were $5 each! Sweet!\nComplementary chips & salsa made a quick appearance at our table!\nI ordered the Nacho's as my \" main meal\" ( no meat) but they do offer chicken or steak at an additional charge). I replaced the avocado & sub'd it for guacamole (extra fee). Crispy fried flour tortillas lightly salted & topped with delicious fixings that included a creamy lime aioli- Amazing!\nWe also ordered a burrito called \"the beast\" and they give the option to deep fry it: \"chimichanga style! \"Yes please!! It was killer!\"\n\"Lastly\"; three tacos that come out on a silver slotted taco rack. Many varieties of meats to choose from. Ordered the braised beef, baja fish & tinga chicken. ALL were incredible! Accompanied by an orange cucumber salad that is extremely unique!\nA MEMORABLE Dessert: called the \"Better than Bettie's, Mexican chocolate brownie plus Cajeta (a creamy warm caramel sauce)  w/ Dulce De Leche ice cream- Deliciously Devine!  \nPresentation of ALL our meals was not only eye appealing, but the taste \"tummy tantalizing\"!! LOL. \nService  by the staff was above & beyond. Not only was our waitress good we were always followed up by Jacy: professional & very well informed of product & store knowledge. Bartender was involved by making an appearance @ our table to deliver a pitcher to us!\nWay to go guys, place is super edgy, fun & fabulous!\nWe will be back soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove that Gilbert AZ is coming up in the world. When I moved to Chandler, 6 years ago, finding a decent local restaurant was a pipe dream! Now we have Postino and Joyride. God bless Craig DeMarco and Lauren Bailey for bringing us these restaurants. Love the hipster atmosphere, margaritas, fresh agua frescos, crispy fish taco, THE FILA SALAD, and don't event get me started on the churros. Btw, if you ask, they will bring you fresh caramel for the churros and you will pretty much think of nothing else for the next 3 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nYelp failed me. So, so unimpressed. Why is this place rated so high?\nIf you like waiting for 45 minutes to gnaw on nasty tacos in a black hole with music so loud you can't hear the person in front of you, you'll love this place. If that isn't your jam, go to Mucha Lucha taco shop for actual delicious, authentic tacos at half the price. \nThe hostess was snap chatting the whole time we were there, on a busy taco Tuesday night.\nThe one good thing I can say about this place is that their tortillas were great. Not the fillings though.\n\n\n\n\n\nI never like to review a restaurant that opened just 24 hours ago, but I'll make an exception for Joyride. Upwards Projects has this restaurant thing down pat! I met my husband here at 10pm expecting it still to be busy, but there was tons of seating available both inside and outside underneath lanterns hung on a large tree.\n\nI love the decor and ambience. There is lots of fun decorations and bright colors that work well together without being garish. The big U-shaped bar area is fantastic with cushioned, velvety barstools. We were seated at a table near the bussing, but next time, I think the bar area would be the best place, if only for better service.Our waitress wasn't particularly bad, but she didn't check up on us enough. She walked by a few times with a smile, but never stopped to see if we wanted another drink. We always want another drink! Like we often have to do at Postino next door, we started placing orders with the friendly food runners.\n\nThe food and drinks lived up to my expectations and then some. I got a veggie torta filled with squash, mushrooms, corn and avocado. I couldn't taste much of the \"white magic\" (the lime aioli), but the pickled jalapenos on the side really punched up the flavor. The telera bread was sweet which paired well with the spice and smokiness of the veggies. My husband said his carne asada burrito was ok. I loved the red salsa that came on the side. The complimentary chips are excellent, crispy and substantial. They come with a green salsa that's pretty good and is different than the typical tomatillo-based salsa verde.\n\nI really wanted to try a dessert (and salad, street corn, guacamole, etc), but the torta and two excellent cocktails left no room. I got the almond horchata with frangelico and the Mazatlan Mule. The horchata was basically dessert and went down very easy like the other cocktails. My husband got a blood orange margarita made with the standard Sauza tequila, and it was much better than any margarita I've had in a long time. Like their sister restaurant Windsor, I don't think you can go wrong with the cocktail menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nA must stop for tacos every time I'm in town. Not to mention those fabulous margaritas at happy hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame in on a Monday afternoon. \nLocated in downtown are. Able to find street parking. \nOnly about 2 other patrons. We were greeted and seated promptly.\nThey have a really good happy hour with $2 tacos and $5 margaritas and spiked agua frescas. Good selection of menu items. More of a tex-mex feel/taste. \nBlood orange margarita had a nice refreshing sweetness with just a bit of tang. Pretty strong. I was also offered to try the new citrus agua frescas which was great without alcohol but ah-mazing with Hangar citron vodka, cant go wrong with a $5 cocktail!\nFish Taco was crispy with fresh crisp veggies and garlicky white sauce in a fresh flour tortilla.\nCarne asada was very tender and juicy, great fresh corn tortilla.\nBlack beans were great and a large portion for a side.\nAlthough staff was very friendly, we had long wait periods waiting for food and additional drinks. There were very few patrons in the restaurant. We probably would have stayed for another round of drinks if service was more prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\nTook over an hour to get my food. Don't go during lunch and to be honest. The phone wasn't that great either. I ordered the shrimp tacos with coleslaw and the coleslaw was nasty and tasted old and the tacos just weren't worth 10$ for two street tacos. No go\n\n\n\n\n\nNeat atmosphere. Food?  Basically overpriced Chipotle. NO JOKE.  We were never served chips and salsa like everyone around us.  Ordered a Beast burrito bowl, wife ordered 3 tacos. There is nothing that separates the taste or style from Chipotle except the mustaches and hipster pants. First and last time here sadly.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew to Arizona and wanted to check out Taco Tuesday. Well It is a great place to check out. Lots of energy and great food. I enjoyed it so much that I go even when it's not Tuesday!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy go to place for a quick date. Service is awesome which is important on a date. Always there to add extra energy to conversations and help take away some of that first date awkwardness.  Tacos are ok but environment and energy is awesome. No downside.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously delicious food! Homemade corn tortillas which have a consistency of a flour tortilla. Love love love\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:\nthe tacos!\nplenty of parking (maybe this is not a big deal for locals, but as an out of towner - always appreciate easy parking)\n\nfree chips and salsa.  Feel like this is a dying tradition.\n\nMixed:\nFrescas - Cumber Mint is delicious and refreshing. But I got their special, which was Mango, tasted like a weird watered down Mango Lassi.  He actually recommended it and when he asked me if I liked it, and I said, \"my friend's cucumber mint is better\" (as my passive aggressive way to change drinks) he sadly didn't bite.\n\nTIP: ask them to go light on the ice. Half the glass was ice, it was a bit much.\n\nmeh:\nCheese Y Mas - appetizer, on paper sounds great - but once ordered, was a bit disappointed.  I think I was hoping for something more like how adult mac 'n cheese when done righ can make me gladly fork over $14 for mac 'n cheese, or what restaurants have done to burgers to make them fancy. I was expecting a queso twist, but just got Velveeta. \n \nservice - started off attentive and friendly, and than ignored at the end, was so thirsty had to ask to drink some of my friend's water.\n\nEven though I'm giving it a 3 - I'd still come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were seated on the patio and I thought, \"what could be better, it's a beautiful day!\" However, the trees maaaann! I think I ate about 14 little yellow flowers and seeds. Plus, a bird dropped a poo on my handbag. You've been warned.\n\nAnywho, I ordered 3 happy hour tacos thinking they were the street taco sized version. WRONG! They were full sized and crammed with meat, slaw and guacamole. A great value at a couple bucks each. I could only eat 2 and the best one was the Standard. I don't even remember what was in it, it was just yummy! The carne asada taco had a one little bite of gristle :/\n\nI asked the waiter which margarita he would  recommend; I saw several interesting flavors. Surprisingly he suggested a skinny margarita (I tried not to be offended). He was right though, it was a perfect balance of sweet and sour and just enough tequila. \n\nI really enjoyed the vibe, along with the fresh food at Joyride. We'll be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nOK if there was a 3 1/2 stars that is what I would have given it.  Love the decor and rocking 80's music.  Service was very good.  Great deal on pitchers of beer.  Chips and house salsa are very good as well.  Now the OK stuff.  Tacos were pretty good.  I had the chicken tinga.  It was suppose to have \"magic white sauce\" but mine apparently didn't have it.  On a side note, maybe that is a good thing since Joyride Taco House seems like a name for a porno shop.  Chicken tinga was a little bland, likely better with the magic sauce.  Carne asada taco was good.  I personally thought it was a bit pricey for what you got.  Bottom line is that I  would return to drink beer and have chips and salsa especially since we found out the one patio is dog friendly.  I would say give it a try.  Never know you may get the magic white sauce.  ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family and I were recently invited to ,\" Joyride Taco House\" we were extremely blessed to have lunch there. The atmosphere is cool and the waiters & waitresses were excellent ! The food is extremely fresh& tasty. I would go here 5 times a week. I highly recommend this restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crispy fish tacos are the reason we go there. Hard to beat their fish tacos. Kinda pricy unless you go on a Tuesday. Expect very long wait times to be seated. Once seated their service is pretty fast though. Will go back again and again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe staff here is awesome. The food is pretty good, too. We always sit at the bar and they take care of us :) i love all the different salsas and the blood orange margarita is a must!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first few times we came here we were SO impressed and we were really looking forward to our last visit here. However, we were surprised with our extremely disappointing experience. \n\nThe first problem started when we ordered our drinks, one didn't come, the others took forever to get, and one of the drinks (the mule) was overly sweet and gross. This was sad as we loved the drinks here prior to this visit.\n\nThe second problem we encountered were menu items we loved and came back for taken off the menu. No more delicious scallop tacos and no more roast chicken. Instead, we decided to try some new things and order the crispy fish taco we loved before. The fish taco came and it was fishy. Once again it took forever to get our food and some of it came out incorrectly. Of the things we tried we had the sidewalk dish which was just meh. \n\nThe final problem is one I am just assuming to be the case. I think they may have taken the amazing chef that opened Joyride and moved him to the Phoenix location, but who knows. \n\nNot sure if we will be going back which is sad considering how much we loved this place when it first opened.\n\n\n\n\n\nYay, a taco shop in Old Town Gilbert!  I was somewhat apprehensive but having a good taco shop close by that doesn't look like its 50 years old was a must try.\n\nGlad we did.  We went in around noon today, Saturday and sat right away at the bar :) The salsa we got right away was great!  We ordered the tomatillo salsa and it was way to sweet for us but the rest of everything was wonderful\n\nI had the veggie taco which was a great mesh of veggies in a home made tortilla, was great.  DH had the carne asada and one of their pork tacos.  Said the carne asada was awesome as did one of the other guys sitting next to us.  \n\nAtmosphere is fun and inviting.  Pitcher was 7.5 which was great since each draft pint was $5.  All in all one of the cheaper lunches we've had in a fun place and the food was good.\n\nWe did have really good service and it was fast unlike some other reviews, maybe because we sat at the bar but definitely no complaints here.  Overall, really happy this place is close to us as we moved out here a few years ago from Scottsdale and have been waiting for a new favorite!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my new favorite place.  Always busy but their carne asade and crispy fish tacos are amazing!  Great char which adds a Smokey depth To the carne asade.  The fire roasted salsa is delicious. And don't miss out on the churros.  Add the caramel- it's worth it!  Love to sit at the bar.  It's a cool, hip place.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe go to Joyride every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday. Once you know what to order this place is amazing and the service is fantastic! David and the other bartenders are awesome people and great at their jobs, even on such a busy night. The carne asada tacos are #1 for sure. I like the crispy fish as well. If you're looking for a burrito ask the bartenders for a recommendation. They know all the secrets!  As far as legit Mexican tacos, that's not what you go here for. Order queso y mas, carne asada tacos or a burrito with braised beef. Add in the atmosphere and bartenders and you're golden!\n\n\n\n\n\nSoooo, I made the trek out to Gilbert to give Joyride a whirl and I am pleased to say that my gasoline was not wasted. Everything was fantastic! The atmosphere is cool and the staff were completely helpful and friendly. We arrived for an early dinner and were initially blown away by the street corn and the ceviche. They were so fresh and damn near a complete meal all by themselves. But I was not to be cheated out of some meat (and no, fish does not qualify as meat).\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the Beast burrito along with three street tacos (carnitas, short rib and carne asada). The carne asada was flavorful and moist - so unlike the tire rubber you get from other places. The carnitas and short rib were also awesome. We rounded out the meal (and ourselves) with vanilla pudding and I almost had tears in my eye it was so freakin good.\n\nWe shoveled everything back and doused it with some Cucumber Serrano mixed drinks along with a Corona - the coolest looking 32 ounce beer bottle I have laid eyes on in some time. So tasty. \n\nThe patio looks amazing (although I can't say that I even contemplated braving the 112 degree temperatures when we were there) and should be stellar when the weather creeps down. Will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is really good. I ordered three street tacos, two chicken and one carne asada. The chips and salsa were so good i didn't want to eat my tacos when they arrived. The atmosphere was young and hip. The music was was a little loud but i kinda liked it. The best part of this place was the service. We had our cups constantly refilled and people asking us if we needed anything. They kept on bringing chips and salsa to our table the entire time. The only reason why I'm not giving this place a 5 star is because the price was a little high. It was just me and my husband during lunch. We ordered water and we both had the street tacos. Our bill was in the thirties YIKES!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my favorite restaurant! Excellent food. Awesome drinks. Fun environment. I've had many of the tacos and they're all good, but I highly recommend he Braised Beef and Carne Asada. And, they're Cucumber Orange Salad is AH-MA-ZING!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe street tacos here are some of the best!  My husband and I are always looking for a good street taco place and this is our favorite in the valley. The burritos are great also. The staff is great as well. Very friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to make the experience comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos here are fantastic!  Try to make it on taco Tuesday, but expect to wait a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe really enjoyed the tacos here! They also have some really good happy hour deals during the week. The staff is super friendly. You have to try the chicken tacos. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here if you want some.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is amazing! The best bloodymary ever!! Their tacos were delicious as well. They have fiery corn that tasted delicious. The staff were friendly with excellent customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars for fixing their error. I'm highly allergic to avocado. I asked to ensure it was removed, but the kitchen put guacamole on my tacos. I let the waitress know (I always double check because of how bad my allergy is) and they sprang into action. They made me new tacos, took them off our bill, offered me dessert on the house, and gave me coupons for discounted tacos in the next visit. The food was very good and the atmosphere is very trendy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place ... A friend introduced me and it is now my GO TO place.  Yummy and great drinks\n\n\n\n\n\nI was super excited to try this place.  My dear friend and his girlfriend love this place, but my experience wasn't that great.  First of all, this place is in old town Gilbert and the location is poppin... They don't take reservations and we had about 45 minute wait.  The hostess was super friendly and typed my number and name into her ipad for a text message reminder of when my table was ready.  After waiting for only about 20 minutes, we were seated.  \n\nWe had had 2 bowls of chips for a table of six waiting for us when we got to the table.  Our waiter came to the table and got our drink order, however forgot to write down one of the drink orders and we had to remind him of that drink twice before it came out.  Once our waiter took our drink order it took him about 15 minutes to get back to us with our drinks.  Then another 15 minutes went by before he took our dinner order.  Our dinner order took awhile to get made and when the food came out, our tacos were cold.  The tacos are served \"family style\", which means they are all on the same taco holder and if you're allergic to fish or shrimp, sorry your carne asada taco will be served right next to the fish taco.  \n\nAll of the meat tacos lacked flavor, I would recommend trying the fish taco.  It had the best flavor out of all the options we ordered.  The waiter forgot to write down a few things that we ordered and those things never came out with our food.  We decided not to remind him about those missing sides as he would visit our table once every 15 minutes.\n\nI don't think I will be back here again.  There are other taco restaurants that I perfer over this place.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Great salsas.  The medium salsa had great flavor.  The habanero salsa was more than just heat and had a nice smokey flavor\n- The chicken tinga tacos were excellent\n- The grilled baja fish tacos were pretty bland.  Reminded me of overcooked farmed salmon\n- The ceviche was pretty bland.  Just not a lot there\n- I liked the open space\n- Solid service\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing Tacos!! Fun and casual environment! I eat here regularly and prices are very reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove love love this place's street corn. Amazing service and great food.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome! Service was great! Ambiance was great! Food was amazing! Highly recommend: crispy fish taco, braised beef taco and shrimp ceviche. This might be my new favorite spot!\n\nOne thing I would change, is I would love for these tacos to be a crispy shell. The soft was good, but crispy would have been the BEST (for most tacos, not all). Maybe the option to choose???\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far my favorite taco joint in the Phoenix area. We are new to Chandler, so when asked about a recommendation I quickly turned to Yelp for suggestions. With over 1000 reviews, I had to check this place out. I arrived early to put in our name for a party of 8. It was Taco Tuesday, so I new that it'd be packed. There was a 90 minute wait, so I grabbed a beer and sat out front for the rest of the party to arrive. I love that you can sit outside and get adult standby drinks from a server that takes drink orders while you wait. Beats standing at the bar and waiting forever. \nThe food was great! I powered down 5 tacos ($2/ea.), chips and salsa, and some churros. Everyone else raved about the food and service, so I was the praised as the food hero that night. Thank you Yelp.\n\nOnly suggestion to the restaurant owner: Different patio chairs. I kept sliding on the seat and ended up slouching for most of the night.\n\n\n\n\n\nAte here for the fourth time today in a few months.  It was perfect. Every table was full the entire two hours we were there. A great mix of people and a great \"chill\" vibe to the atmosphere.  Awesome music playing at just the right volume. Civeche is awesome, so is the Lola salad and pork tacos.  Had a great time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is to die for and happy hour rocks!  Seriously one of my top five favs....\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent ambiance, not so flavorful meats.  Definitely a place to go for happy hour, but not tacos.  And not the grilled corn.  No good.  Sorry guys.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the atmosphere, taco Tuesday is great.  We also like the chorizo cheese fondue, get it every time.  We've tried lots of things on the menu, but it's best to stick to the tacos.  In this case the atmosphere supersedes any food offerings but sometimes that's ok!  \n\n**15 years and counting in the service and hospitality industry/ local restaurant owner\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tried this place tonight, on Gilbert Rd where there are many cool places to eat (Dierks Bentley's Whisky Row is across the street) and the tacos were amazing!  The tacos are a la carte so you can get different ones.  I had the a carne asada taco and a shrimp taco, soooo good!  The carne asada taco was so full of flavor!  Now, our server,  Tori, was a doll!  She was very helpful and had such a great personality!  If anything, we will return, just to see her...she was adorable!  I wish that more servers were like her.  I highly recommend trying this place.  The decor reminded me of the 70's, but it was done just right.  Even the music went with the vibe.  Tori proceeded to tell us of their drink special times where they have seven different flavors of margaritas for $5, as well as $5 pitchers of beer.  You can sit outside and watch the cars and people go by, sit inside, or on their back patio.  Again, ask for Tori's section, you won't be sorry!\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious! Had the tacos which were moist and awesome. My cucumber mint water came out a tiny bit after the food and the manager (? I only assume) said it was on the house because it came out late. Totally awesome service. We were very pleased. Plus we needed a really quick meal and they delivered despite being really busy. Thanks Joyride!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very fun place.  We sat at the bar and were served immediately.   This is Americanized version of Mexican food that uses fresh ingredients and crafty presentations.  The restaurant design is modern and hip.  Our salad and burrito were delicious.   Cool hangout or date spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was great :) We ordered only tacos for Taco Tuesday, one of each. They were all incredible, and I recommend the carne asada tacos. The meat is excellent, seasoning superb, and the service, well, it's reasonable. We waited for an hour, with warning, but the servers looked overloaded. I'm so impressed by the food, though, and that's why i am readying 4 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent over to enjoy HH with my friend. They had a decently sized HH menu so we were excited to try it out. On weekdays, HH lasts from 2pm-6pm, and the menu features $5 margaritas, $5 pitchers of Dos Equis or Negro Modelo, $2 tacos, and a few other items.\n\nJoyride Tacos is a cute little spot that seems reminiscent of a beach bar. We went at an odd hour, and they were still pretty busy which seemed promising. There was room at the bar so we sat right away, and we were promptly served with waters and some chips with salsa. The salsa was light and very acidic with a very slight kick. \n\nThe server brought over small plates, but the bottom one had crusted food (maybe guacamole based on the color) on it, but he promptly took it back as soon as he noticed. We got the prickly pear margarita and the bloody orange margarita, crispy fish tacos, pork adobada tacos, carne asada tacos, ceviche, and some beer. The pitchers of beer for $5 were smaller pitchers (the same size as they serve at Postino's HH). I don't like sweet drinks much, so the margarita was a bit sweet for me. Also, being from New Mexico, I was not very impressed with the prickly pear margarita nor the pork adovada; the margarita was nothing that memorable but not bad. It was strong at least, which is always good. My friend only said her bloody orange margarita was a lot sweeter than my margarita.\n\nThe food overall was a little bit bland. I personally like my food less salty, so if you are like me, it may be a nice change of pace from other restaurants in that sense. However, I know that under seasoned food is not looked upon kindly in restaurants. My friend liked the carne asada taco best as it did have some nice smokey notes, but again, it was under seasoned. The tacos were also a decent size (bigger than I thought they would be. I had expected more traditional sized tacos). The crispy fish tacos were probably my favorite, only because of how crisp they were, but they were also the least flavorful. The pork adovada and the carne asada were both dry.\n\nThey were pretty busy, but it did kind of suck that they forgot our order for more beer twice (two different servers too). Another server usually found us, fortunately, but it was a tad bit annoying to keep being told to hold on, while we waited. \n\nOverall, I think it is a decent HH spot, but definitely not my favorite. I would rank this maybe a 3.5 or 4 star experience. Not sure if I will really return as there are so many good restaurants in the area. Maybe if I am in the area and want some beer and California-style tacos (though I prefer authentic tacos)? Not the worst, but not anywhere near the best.\n\n\n\n\n\nTory our waitress was amazing. made amazing suggestions and we loved everything. the ceviche is a must. My son ordered 2 orders of the kids quesadilla because he loved it. Fish tacos were my favorite, the husband loved the carne asada tacos. we will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came in and the only seating inside was the bar so we opted to sit there. Jay was our server and he was outstanding however we couldn't help but watch the other employees. We noticed a server named Jackie shorting customers on their well paid drinks. She was dumping a good portion out and then adding more ice to compensate and reusing mixing cups. We also noticed that she would have drinks dripping off her hands then putting her hands in the ice bin. As we sat watching the people next to us got to listen in on how a certain employee would talk to her and made things awkward. Joyride in the past has been phenomenal but, this experience has been the worst for us. I would hate to be the person who paid 9-10$ for a margarita and got shorted.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the atmosphere at this location.  The staff is always friendly, and the service is fantastic.  Just beware of Taco Tuesday...the place is packed.\n\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE the tacos here but its really annoying that they charge for chips and salsa. They give you a super small bit of salsa and a HUGE bowl of chips but if you want more of either you have to pay. The servers are pretty nice too.\n\n I would not go here for anything other than taco Tuesday. I went with four people and the bill was 60 dollars!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am coming back here. Went with a friend who is a huge fan of Mexican foods of all kinds. We were both impressed with the food and service. The guac was great, the almond horchata was a pleasantly refreshing surprise, and the Garden Variety burrito was the best veggie burrito I have ever had. My friend was happy with her street tacos as well. The service at the Gilbert location was wonderful as well. We were immediately brought chips, salsa, and water, and our server was pleasant and very accommodating. Her recommendations were spot on.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came in for dinner in a Friday night and had a good experience. It was busy and they told us it would be about 45 minutes for a family of 4. We ended up waiting only 30 minutes, and they had a server outside making sure people could get drinks while they waited. They use the Nowait app for their wait list, so if you have it check before you go to get added to the list. \n\nOnce inside, our waitress came up to ask about drinks and starters. They also brought out water and chips and salsa immediately. Our food was good. They serve street tacos and some burritos. I ordered the bandit taco platter which had carne asada, carnitas, and chicken tinga. They came fajita style so I could assemble them myself. My husband ordered three tacos:shrimp, Baja fish, and carne asada. The Baja fish was really good! All the others were good too, but most were a little too salty. \n\nI also ordered a couple drinks. I had the blood orange margarita and the pineapple mojito. The margarita was strong, but good. I liked the pineapple mojito better, it was really tasty!\n\nI'd say that the main thing for me was the service. Our waitress and the server outside were very attentive and friendly. We went with our young kids and while they were prepared for families I think it's a better place for adults looking for a night out. I would definitely go back again but next time maybe with friends for a fun night out.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir service surpasses their food, but that isn't a bad thing because their food is pretty dang good. They have a decent selection of food and similar to their company sibling Positions, have achieved a remarkable atmosphere that makes ya' just want to relax. Joyride is a decent place to grab some gourmet tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper tasty tacos, salsa, and my favorite is the beet, papaya, goat cheese salad and add shrimp!  So good!!  It is busy and it's a bummer when it's super busy because it can become a servers frenzy, but so worth it once you eat the food!  Like the venue as well!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friends have been hyping this place up so I tried it today on a business lunch. I liked the atmosphere. The music and the open feel we nice, and the service was very good. Food came out fast as well. That's about where it ends. I had 3 different tacos, two of which I would probably never order again, with the third being just ok. The chips and salsa were not that good and the rice was average. I think if you wanna go somewhere uber-trendy and way over-pay for tacos that are not that good and are definitely not Mexican food, then this is the place for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nNegatives:\nHipster hangout. Looks like a 70's lounge. \nThe Mexican mule does not deserve the name. It was a passion fruit cocktail in a regular glass with tequilla. No TACO TUESDAY deals! What kind of taco place does not do taco tuesday? Tacos were flavorless except the chicken tinga. \nServers keep their phones in the retro ice chest at the front of the restaurant (weird, I know). \n\nPositives:\nThe Big Lebowski picture\nChips and Salsa\n\n\n\n\n\nGet beyond the super high hipster factor and treat yourself to Joyride. The food is varied and delicious, the prices are just right. Full of flavor, my carne asada and chicken street tacos were awesome- loaded with meat and veggies. The \"white magic\" sauce was super tasty too. There's a great kids menu to order from if you bring the family. There's plenty of seating, even for larger groups- and the decor is as you'd expect from Upward Projects (Postino, Windsor, Federal Pizza). The staff is great, they seem to play more of a \"zoned\" game wherein many servers will cover each other's tables to ensure the customer is being treated right. Don't worry about empty drink glasses or missing food, that didn't happen for us at Joyride. The place was busy, don't let a small wait time scare you away. There's competition at the other end of Gilbert road (So Cal Fish Taco Company) but I'd have to give Joyride the 5th star when comparing. If you're craving good mexican food (tacos, burritos, ensaladas, etc.) do yourself a favor and head over to Joyride. Sign up for their email list and you'll get offers for free food, etc. We didn't order drinks but they offer a full bar and plety of room to huddle around it and enjoy your cervezas or margaritas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis taco shop is located in downtown Gilbert. My husband and I decided to give it a try. We stopped right at lunch time and it was moderately busy. We were greeted right away, when the host asked us where we wanted to sit, we asked for a booth inside, but he took us to a table outside, under a tree that was shedding. Normally, on a warm day in AZ you welcome sitting in the shade, but not this time. \nWe asked to be moved inside, and we found a booth. Our waitress was by a short time later for our drink orders. The menu is pretty basic, salads, soups, tacos, burritos, sides....I feel the prices are high for what this place is. I feel that 4.50 for one small shrimp taco is high, but that's just my opinion. I ordered the shrimp tacos, 2 of them. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. \nThe tacos were average. Nothing spectacular. There were 3 big pieces of shrimp, lettuce, tomato and pico de gallo. \nThe decor is yuppie, trendy and upscale. The service was okay. Our waitress was friendly, and attentive.\n\n\n\n\n\nCome for lunch! $5 pitchers two tacos and small salad lunch special! Try the chard habanero salsa if you dare.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother great Gilbert restaurant. Tacos were excellent,location is great. It was a casual atmosphere that was great to take clients to.Good music, Good food and Great atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir tacos are really good but expensive so try to catch happy hour or during lunch and you can get 2 tacos and a salad for $10. The salads are unique and refreshing, and I love how they put a good amount of avocado on almost everything ! :)\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't come. Been waiting over an hour to be seated. People just sitting inside done eating but not leaving. Horrible service outside getting drinks too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething is happening with service, took almost 30 minutes to be seated, was actually not busy and there where empty tables, got water but took 20 minutes to get drinks and took another 30 minutes to place order and 1hr15 minutes to get food and they weren't busy.  Actually tried this place because had lousy service from Postino's, just found out there owned by the same people.  Going to Texas Roadhouse, never a bad time, in 20 years.  And with 8 kids and 9 grand kids, this place will be gone soon and replaced with new owner and management and name.  Seen it happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace is overrated. Service was slow, fish taco wasn't very fresh. Waiter forgot our rice and the price was too high for such a small taco!!\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here for happy hour tacos and got just that.  You will need to order 3-5 of $2 tacos to be full.  I tried all of the various meat and fish tacos and they were all delicious with the juicy flavorful carnitas and pork adobada being my favorites.  Since those two were the juicier ones, they immediately tore through the fold of the tortilla and had to be eaten in a deconstructed manner.  The carne asada was well-grilled but was on the sweeter side and almost tasted like the grilled beef on Vietnamese broken rice dishes.  Chips and salsa free for first round only then they charge $2 for refills.  That was disappointing so we paid for only 1 refill and didn't even have extra salsa to put on our tacos. The whole point of Mexican dining is to endlessly and regretfully nibble on chips and salsa until you can't eat your entree.  I ordered the Mexican chocolate brownie which was good but too sweet.  The spicy walnuts though were delicious!  On a different visit I tried their elote which was as good as any other elote but 3x the price.  Overall, decent but menu too limited to come often. I know it's a taco house but still.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing! We had a $5 picture of an outstanding IPA and the best burritos we've ever had. We will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nYay for an awesome taco place! Service was good; a very casual atmosphere. The food was awesome! We built up a taco plate (you can do a la carte as well), and had the guacamole. Portions are decent. Convenient location in downtown Gilbert. Will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I ate here on Thursday. Weekends we never can find parking for any restaurant in Gilbert. We were immediately seated and greeted by our server.Chips and salsa were here before you knew it. I ordered a  chicken burrito in a bowl. My husband ordered 3 tacos and a salad. 2 of the tacos were happy hour price! Good size servings. My only complaint is we didn't have room for dessert. .\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to try these tacos. They are unreal! They taste organic and home made! \n\nThe atmosphere at the restaurant is super chill too. I'd recommend this place for hanging out with friends or for a business meeting. \n\nThe staff is unreal too. They are all very happy and willing to help.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's amazing hear. Always busy and there is a reason why. The tacos are perfect, the drinks are amazing, and I love the chips and salsa. If your just a party of 2 sometimes you can get into the bar fairly quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nShelby was awesome.  It was our first time there.  She recommended the perfect sides and tacos.  Definitely will be back. They had us at 5 dollar pitchers of beer .\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter giving this place two times, I will not be returning. The margaritas are like juice and not at all worth the price. Bartender was rude and clearly not liking his job. I tried to give them a little slack since it was Taco Tuesday, but there are way better places out there without the long wait and much better drinks and service.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest tacos and margaritas!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This place is our go to place for date night!! Service is always on point and atmosphere is awesome!!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place for tacos in Gilbert! \n\nLocated in the heart of downtown Gilbert, Joyride Taco's does not disappoint! First off, if you're going at a busy time, you're gonna have to wait, but it's all good cause they serve awesome margaritas while you wait for your table! I got myself this pomegranate margarita and my wife got a mojito! Both drinks were awesome and they hit the spot! While I think we waited for around 45 minutes, the drinks made it enjoyable and made it feel like I waited for 5 minutes while I had a nice convo with the wife. \n\nWe got seated outside since it was a nice day outside and the server was really nice. We said it was our first time and she went over the menu with us, told us what were HER favorites, and overall was very welcoming. \n\nSince it was Happy Hour, we got some fish tacos along with some al pastor tacos and they were awesome! The chips and salsa were amazing too and they conveniently refilled our basket like 3 times when I didn't ask! Such a nice experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the guacamole and the nachos! Great service! I sat outside with my friends and enjoyed the great food and beautiful desert weather.\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic service, excellent tacos and guacamole, trendy fun atmosphere!  My husband loved his burrito.  Blood orange margarita is my favorite!   We have been here half a dozen times and every time it's been stellar!  If you order tacos in a group they bring them all out together which can be complicated.  Great place if you have kids!\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowest service ever. Sat at our table waiting for so long ended up just having to leave.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to check out Joyride. What a blast. Gilbert has needed an awesome new hang out and Craig Demarco has done it again. Sit at the bar and you will not be disappointed. IF you are lucky enough to have Chris(tall and bearded) as your bartender, you will have the best service in town. The fish tacos are great and the nachos are probably the best item on the menu to share. \n\nOne again upward projects has provided an awesome restaurant and I can't say enough GREAT things about this place and it's staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere to begin with this place?  located in the heart of downtown Gilbert, this place has retro written all over it.  everything from the sign to the decor has a mid century modern meets a surf side grub joint style to it.  walking in i was really amused with the place so i knew i would be in for a good time.  \n\non this visit i only came for some beers and sadly did not get to try any of the food other than the chips and salsa which were quite tasty.  The beer selection was pretty decent with a large collection of Mexican beers.  i was happy they had my favorite which is Victoria.  Although I did not taste, the fish tacos looked pretty scrumptious as well.  \n\ndowntown Gilbert is really booming and if you're looking for a fun festive atmosphere this place is it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have amazing vegetarian Mexican food. I would call it Mexican nouveau rather than authentic Mexican. Way more interesting than the beans/rice/cheese places you typically find in the Phoenix area. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very receptive to suggestions and imaginative with the drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place, always friendly staff and creative modern menu items always hit the spot.  Highly recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos are okay, bummer there's no option for crunchy tacos, it would change everything if there were. Chips/salsa, beast burrito are really good though.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have eaten here before and at the Central Phoenix location and was a little surprised how rude the staff were.\n\nMy friends and I went in Friday night for drinks and appetizers and asked to be seated outside. She took us to a far corner table off by ourselves on the front patio that was covered in dirt. We then asked to move inside and she shoved us in the very corner booth by the kitchen where we were almost hidden from the entire restaurant when there were plenty of other booths and tables open. \n\nOur actual server was very nice but it honestly took incredibly long to simply get a drink refill on our water, chips and salsa. They were not that busy, it just seemed due to the seating location we were so hidden and off by ourselves he kept forgetting about us. \n\nAfter we finished the food the plan was to hang out and order a few drinks until we decided where else to go. Another server came over immediatley and dropped the bill. He then came back three or four times to check and see if we had placed the cards in there yet. I dont get why servers do this. IT IS SO RUDE. We werent in a hurry, they werent busy at all, we werent bothering anyone but yet they made us feel like we were a complete burden by being there. Ordering $7.00 drinks x4 and food and minding our own business I wouldnt think to be a hassle of a table. \n\nIm only giving them two stars for the food because thats been on point every time I have been there. I used to work for this company when it was jointly owned with the folks from Chelseas Kitchen.. I remember first hand how seriously customer satisfaction was taken while employed with them and am sad to say, they are not carrying on that same mindset to this new concept.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe salsa that came with the chips was too spicy so I asked if they have a milder salsa. The waitress said they have some pico that was milder a brought some out. However, there was a $2 charge for the pico and we weren't told.  They removed the pico charge upon my request. I wanted a taco salid but they didn't have one on the menu so I had nachos with added chicken. The chicken was spongy and didn't seem to be real chicken chunks. The cheese was a white sauce and not flavorful so the nachos were bland. The service was fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThird time I have been in the past month, sad to say it will be my last. Poor service, long wait, dirty tables. When we finished our food we had to wait for over 20 min for someone to come back over. The waitress stated that she could not run our card due to her family being in town??? Yup, that's what she said! Another girl came ran our card and gave me a box to box my own food. Now the server that stated she could not run my card was able to come over to grab the tip though. Great food! It's just a shame that the service is going down.\n\nA manager by the name of Brad has since contacted me. He stated that he working on correcting the issue. I appreciate the fast response, maybe give them another try next month?\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Joyride Taco House!  The service is always friendly and attentive.  The decor is fun and contemporary.  Best of all, the food is consistently delicious.  I love the roasted veggies, the Mexican street corn, all the amazing tacos (especially the two kinds of fish tacos), the tamales, the burritos and black beans.  And, oh my, the hot homemade churro's served with slightly spicy warm chocolate sauce for dipping!  Joyride is our go-to place for special events.  There can be a long wait (wish they had call ahead!) and it can be somewhat noisy inside.  But this restaurant is well worth it!\n\n\n\n\n\nYUMMY! The watermelon marg was amazing. Great chips and salsa, and great tacos!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant, like the ones next to it (Postino, Liberty Market, etc.), is super hip. The decor is very bright and California beach house-y. I came here with a few friends, and we had a great time. \n\nFree chips and salsa, and we got two refills while we were there. We also ordered some chicken quesadillas to share. The waiter brought us carne by mistake, but we started eating it anyway, figuring it wasn't a big deal. Then he came by with the chicken, apologizing and saying it was on the house, which was pretty awesome. \n\nThe two orders of quesadillas plus the seemingly endless chips and salsa left me feeling pretty full, but I still managed to eat the two tacos I ordered. One friend ordered a burrito and another ordered the enchiladas. We all thought the food was good, and priced decently for the atmosphere you get.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were looking for a tasty Mexican restaurant and saw favorable reviews for Joyride. We were not disappointed. Located in the heart of old town Gilbert, Joyride is nestled between two other restaurants. We sat outside on a relatively cool day but were kept warm by the fireplace and space heaters. The salsa is outstanding with a kick and the Cadillac margarita delicious. We had a variety of tacos which are served on outstanding corn tortillas. Wonderful flavored. Impeccable, attentive service; we were brought more salsa without having to ask and were asked if we wanted more chips. Highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was simply craving a fish taco when my husband recommend this new place he drove by the other day.  I love the food and cannot get enough. As such I am willing to pay $4 for a taco. The guacamole alone will keep you coming back night after night. \n\nI can not bring myself to eat inside as the facility is cramped and SO LOUD.  We always enjoy our visit on the patio.  I really enjoy the weekday staff, who are so professional and willing to help.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The beer battered fish tacos are the best around! The churros in chocolate are a must. They have a good beer selection and service has always been on point. We even came here with an infant a few different times and they even made special accommodations for us. I always find myself recommending this place to people!\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet tacos.  Came over for lunch and ordered the trio taco combo which were good.  The sides were poorly prepared so I'd almost pass even though they are a $1 extra, nobody finished the sides.  There's tons of seating for everyone.  But fun atmosphere for your meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here three times now and like it says above \"I'm a fan!\" My favorite is the fish tacos and carnitas. They have all been excellent however. I did have a burrito once and while it was good, I would stick to the tacos in the future. The chocolate and churros are also a yummy good treat! They have great happy hour specials on drinks and tacos. Love the atmosphere in this place, fun retro vibe. Service is a little slow sometimes but nothing horrible.\n\n\n\n\n\nI parked a few blocks away because they have no parking lot. Walking over in an alley behind, a dude stopped and hollered at me for walking on his road. (There was no sidewalk or other way to walk to this joint)  I was seated in a booth with no lighting. A dark place with nice sunlight coming in the open double doors a few feet away. Perhaps one little light for mood, if not to allow a businessman the ability to read some documents over lunch.  The lunch special was hidden and off the menu. I knew it was 10 bucks and was the reason why I gave this place a chance.  Ordered two tacos and some kind of salad that looked like something served   at a Star Wars restaurant/bar in the movie.  The fish taco was ice cold. The shredded beef in the other taco was lukewarm at best, but tasty. \n\nForget the sauce for the chips. It is too hot!!! And nothing else to replace it. So I munched on the chips, which was the only item I loved, being a corn husker from Iowa. The soda came and walla, a broken chipped and sharp edge glass contained it. Was watered down D. Pepper. Sent that back and no replacement came until I was almost done eating the chilled tacos.  Got one free due to the screw up.\n\nFinally, watch that strange salad on the special. The peas are petrified and \"rocks\". I am not kidding, I almost chipped a tooth until I wised up to sort them out of the salad. Insane to put those in any food that you charge money for.  The servers, were overdoing the nicey thing. Except one who walked by and said \"You could have downed a Margarita by now\"  Hey Joyride Taco, I don't drink so can you please keep your stupid flyby comments to yourself?\n\nOh, BTW, there were only millennials in there for lunch. Except one dude that was older that looked like a former hippy.  The grunge head banging music was maxed out most of the time I was there and making me wish I had went to Joe's across the street where seniors are welcomed. If  you are older than 35, don't go here!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty tasty food, fun environment, really odd experience overall.\n\nSo this was my first trip to Joyride Taco House, and it was a rather odd experience, service-wise. I'll get to that after mentioning the food first.\n\nThe setting is pretty fun. It's right in the middle of Gilbert's \"main street\". The big side doors open for a nice open, airy experience. When the weather is nice, it's a perfect setting.\n\nThe chips and salsa came out first. These chips are better than most out there--a little thick, with some good flavor. And the salsa, though not particularly spicy, is really good stuff. My date told me that the guacamole is excellent--I'll have to try it another time.\n\nWe shared the chicken burrito and a couple of tacos--the pork adovada and the chicken. The burrito was excellent! There are a ton of items in that burrito, and the combination of all of them was really good. The sauce provided added some nice extra flavor as well. I must say that quantity-wise, this is a pretty small burrito. If I ordered this as my full meal, I'd probably have been a bit disappointed. Fortunately, I had 2 other tacos. The tacos were decent. The pork was disappointingly bland, though. I'm not sure what happened with it, but it just didn't do it for me. The chicken was really solid. I'll come back to try some of the other tacos.\n\nSo the odd part of the experience. We sat at the table for over 3 hours, and not a single person ever asked us if we wanted our check. Now, this normally would be grounds for a really low rating in my book, but I am considering the situation in its entirety. We were having a lot of fun talking, and that was likely apparent to others. Maybe they were just respecting our having a conversation. But still, not a single person asked us if we wanted our check, and at some point, they seemed to completely forget about us. We'd have left earlier if somebody had come and asked us, but because nobody did and we weren't in a rush, we just kept talking. When we finally had to leave, I walked up to the bar, because we couldn't find our server. A manager saw me and asked me if I wanted the check. So we got it and finally left.\n\nGood food, good setting. And I'll give the service another chance in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nA really great taco place! I went here with my family a week or two ago. The atmosphere is nice and casual, but it's still okay to wear a cute dress or a nice shirt.\n\nThey have good happy hour deals! My family mostly ordered from this because we wanted to try the tacos. We weren't let down! I got the standard (signature?) taco which was delicious! Be prepared for a little bit of a messy meal though. Don't wear your best outfit in case you drop, drip, or spill. \n\nMy only complaint (if you can even call it that!) is that the waiters/waitresses all wear regular nice clothes, so if you have questions, you must memorize the face. You might mistake a twenty something for one of the workers! But otherwise very good service and very good fresh food! A fun place to try with your friends or family.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid!   Great cocktails, great service for our large group of 7, good food and good atmosphere!\n\nWe had a blast!\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos are really good...when they have happy hour.  Otherwise kind of expensive.  Sides and drinks were awesome!  Outside seating and inside seating are both fun!  I think the fish tacos were my fave.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has great food.  They are pricey, it's crowded and loud but the food is amazing and so are their signature drinks.  They also have terrific service which I loved.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, Joyride, I really want to like you but I just can't. Maybe I ordered the wrong things. I opted to get the the tamales because they come with the house rice and veggies instead of having to pay extra for sides with the tacos. The tamales were just okay, kind of expensive for what you get, and I have to say I really missed having a side of beans built into the meal with the rice. However, the \"white magic\" sauce is fantastic. A star for that alone! Maybe other Mexican food places have spoiled me but seriously how much more expensive would it be to included some beans with the meal?? I also got the Jamaica...I mean, Hibiscus drink and it was by far way too sweet. Which was shocking for me because I love sugary sweet things and it was just too much. So much so I didn't even want dessert. I've never said that before. I always want dessert. The house salsa is okay. Not bad but again not great and same goes for the chips. Definitely not what they should be using to draw people into the place. I will say the staff is super friendly and attentive. Maybe too much so. At least 5 different people asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa. It made me wonder exactly who was our server if everyone is checking on us. Nice but odd. Anyway, I promise to try you one more time for the tacos. Fingers crossed it'll be better.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ate lunch at your restaurant today. The food was good but the service was terrible. We left the office to have lunch and sat at the table almost 45 minutes waiting for our food.  Refills on a drink and/or water took incredibly long after the server said he would refill our drinks. Very expensive too.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuy bueno! Delicious street tacos. Fresh ingredients. Margaritas are tasty too. The decor is a much needed switch up from the norm. We love meeting friends there. Just like anywhere in downtown gilbert, it gets crowded on weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best first experience at a new restaurant since moving to AZ! The patio was gorgeous and inviting with a nice fire.  We highly recommend sitting outside. Our Crispy Fish tacos were delicious and the guacamole was on pointe. My husband doesn't even like avocado or guacamole and he loved it. The service, presentation combined with the fact that multiple servers stopped by our table to help us rounded out the experience. The best part though was our server, Hunter. He was lively, attentive, and engaging even educated us on the on tap beer choices. We will be back for the tacos and for the great service.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like Joyride, but please understand you must manage your expectations. This is not the place to get authentic Mexican food for cheap. I mean, C'mon, this is Gilbert. You should go to Carolina's in Central Phoenix if you want a delicious tostada for pennies. You go to Joyride for the hip atmosphere, the funky decor, and the spiked agua frescas. \n\nThat being said, I love their Mix Tape salad (to which I like to add carne asada), and their almond horchata. The chips and salsa are good too, but I would pass on the Mexican corn. I think $5 for an ear of corn (no matter how much you dress it up) is ridiculous. I tried it, and it was okay.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Joyride too much for my own good. My friend always raved about this place so I finally gave in. We came here on a friday around 9 pm and were immediately seated outside. We got the guacamole and three different tacos, which were all amazing. Our server was really nice and the music was great. I will definitely be returning soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a love hate relationship with this place.  I love their margaritas and that they can serve beer in a small pitcher.  Tacos are good but I hate when the tortillas are cold.  I've had the adobada, carne asada, carnitas, both fish tacos and the brisket... all good IMO, except when the tortillas are cold . But I'll be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally good food! Not an ordinary mexican go-to place. The Beast Burrito was tasty! Also was a quick service. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis taco place overall was not very good. \n\nWhen we got here we saw an empty table that could accommodate all of the people we had. They said there would be an hour long wait, and after waiting about 20-30 mins we got seated at that same table!\n\nI ordered the crispy fish tacos and the shrimp tacos. (The crispy fish comes with flour and so I asked for corn). \nThe tortillas were horrible quality, they fell apart relatively easily and in general were mediocre at BEST. The shrimp had a bad taste, and was rubbery. The best part of the tacos were the pico da gringo and the fish in the fish tacos. The salsa was super tasty, but the ceviche we ordered was eh. \n The music was super loud, it was hard to hear people sitting across from me which was annoying. \nOverall the quality of this place could have been better. I think that this place is over rated on yelp, based on actually trying the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an awesome spot. It's fancy but doesn't lose the authentic Mexican food you crave. Servers are great and the vibe is fun.\n\nI'd definitely try the cheese quesadilla and the Beast Burrito might be the best burrito around, just sayin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter two visits, it is just an ok experience.  There is no real waiting area in this small place, and there is always a wait, even when they have two tables open and cleared.\nThe prickly pear margarita was overly sweet with more syrup than tequila.  I just wanted my tacos to be hot, and they never are.  Just no real reason to try again.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing drinks, great food. Never had a bad experience.  Except one time there was a lot of flies during the day. Other than that all food so far is delish and drinks are too!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to give this place a second try after poor service the first visit. We were let down once again, so we won't be back. Food was lukewarm (veggie enchiladas), service was extremely slow (again)  and even though it is clearly noted on the website menu,  NO ARIZONA WINE. Too bad. Going forward  I will spend money on a real local first business.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun place!!  Great atmosphere and being downtown Gilbert makes it a great location!  Warning though - you will most likely have quite a wait!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst service ever, had to find someone to get chips, drink refills and pay the bill even after asking the server. Appetizer corn was cold, Beast burrito so so. Never going back...\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the world ends, I want the the last flavor on my tongue to be the scallop tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came here on a Saturday night with my girlfriends.  We waited approximately 20 minutes for a table but not bad compared to everywhere else around there which were quoting an hour or more wait!! We were seated outside and the ambiance was so relaxing.  We ordered nachos, one of the burritos, guacamole, and each ordered a taco!! The food was absolutely delicious!! Good food with good people made for a great night!! Will definitely return in the future :)\n\n\n\n\n\nAwful and over priced!  Water spilled all over me and my new coach purse and snobby staff all expect for our waiter. Hated everything about it. I knew we should of went to the BBQ place across the street.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was one of the first spots my husband and I found when we moved in town. We love the atmosphere, music, and the food is yummy! The ambiance is laid back, but not so laid back you don't see your server for 20 minutes at a time (HUGE pet peeve for me). We eat there more than we probably should admit, but we love it! \n\nIf I had to find a negative it would be that the chips aren't endless...  just give us the chips\n\n\n\n\n\nWow!  Great food, attentive service and all the beautiful people you could ask for.  Seriously.  Everyone in the place was stunning,  I loved LOVED the crispy fish taco and would probably just keep ordering those if I returned.  Why mess with a good thing? My husband had a variety of other tacos and he enjoyed them all.  I am also now obsessed with their orange cucumber salad.  Since I don't live in the area I will be trying to replicate it when I get home.  Not a cheap meal, but worth the price.  It doesn't get any better than this!\n\n\n\n\n\nJack Black may be known for the \"Get That Corn Outta My Face!\" meme, where he slaps two ears on a stick from Esqualito's hands.  It was probably because Hector scored the offending vegetable from America's Taco Shop, which has an embarrassingly bad rendition of this barrio sensation.\n\nI shall be known as the \"Get That Corn Inta My Face!\" guy, after ordering elote from the Joyride app offering.  I am the Albexican, and know good corn Mexican.  Yeah that rhymed, I do it all the timed!\n\nAnother win for the vegetarians comes in the Garden Variety Burrito, enchilada style... sawed in half, with competing red and green sauces covering each dismemberment.  Snicker's could never satisfy like this\n\nLil tip... when you order, say, a... pineapple auga fresca... drink it quickly.  If you let it sit, the ice will melt, and you'll end up with a watered down agua fresca... and your heart will be sad.\n\nFinally, and potentially the most important aspect (depending on if you're actively on laxatives or not)... the bathroom scene.  Let's taco bout it.\n\nThere's three doors.  Choose wisely, don't doddle.\n\n1. Guys & Gals (The most spacious of the three.  Like driving a Chevrolet Cordova)\n2. Gals & Guys (This is the middle child... we'll call it Jan Brady)\n3. Gals  (VERY CRAMPED... because gals get cramps?  I dunno...)\n\n\n\n\n\nNot impressed. Too many screaming kids,  guacamole was not made on premises, Baja fish taco made me deathly ill. Bad fish is supposed  to be thrown away, not hidden in a taco. Waiter thought he could memorize the order,  he was mistaken, should've  written it out. \nNeedless to say, I won't  be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis restaurant group always gets it right.  From the decor, to the food, to the cocktails it's just perfection.  Check out their other concepts at The Windsor, Churn, Postino, and Federal Pizza- you won't be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nYummy tacos & spiked Aguas Fresca! It stays open til midnight on weekends which is very convenient since nearly all of Gilbert is usually closed by 10pm. I am a huge fan of all of Upward Projects restaurants and the area of DT Gilbert so this is a plus in my book! :)\n\n\n\n\n\nDecided we needed to get a taco Tuesday fix, so visited on a Tuesday night. They said the wait was half an hour for a party of 4, so we decided to go down the street for a drink. Before we were even seated and ordered anything, we got a text saying that our table was ready! We headed back in and were promptly seated. Before we even got settled to decide what we wanted, we were given a basket of chips and salsa to snack on. The waiter came back and took our orders then the drinks arrived not too long thereafter. Margaritas were solid, and tacos were delicious. They have a wide variety of options included on their taco Tuesday menu, something for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were seated in a great little spot outdoors right on Gilbert Rd. The night was perfect for conversation, tacos and guacamole.  The atmosphere is very chic with dim lighting that casts the perfect ambiance.\n\nWe started out with salsa, some guac and then moved on to what all the hype is about; tacos. Ordering from the waiter recommendations we sampled The Standard, Braised Beef and Crispy Fish.  Chicken Tacos are generally not my favorite but The Standard was definitely my favorite followed by the Crispy Fish. \n\nOne annoyance was the salsa....  Tiny little saucer of salsa and big bowl of chips. When sharing this with a party of 4 the salsa was gone immediately and refills cost $2.  Little issue I know but it made me :( as I loved the salsa.  :)\n\nEnjoy the Joy Ride!\n\n\n\n\n\nLOVE this place and their tacos!!  A great place to hang out with the girls and have some margaritas, especially the blood orange one!!\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course this place opens when I move back to California. Where was this place during the four years I lived here?! Where to start. . . \nAMBVIANCE- 5 stars. Comfy booths. Great vibes. Fun place to come with your friends. \nFOOD- 5 stars. The menu is super fun. It is full of delicious drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. They have a large selection of juices including cucumber and horchata. I was in love with my almond and cinnamon horchata. You can't go wrong with their guacamole. Their tacos were awesome. I personally loved the shrimp taco best. \nPRICES- 5 starts. Prices range around $3/taco. Amazing deal!\nOverall, I love this place and will return every chance I get.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a fun, colorful place for drinks or dinner. We've been here several times now and can say that the food is consistently great and the service is excellent. Try the blood orange margaritas!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is always delicious, as are the drinks. We always have great service. They lost a star because they charge for salsa refills. Seriously, what restaurant does that?\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was fair !! Not impressed by the flavors. Tacos were  so over priced but I guess thats to be expected in old town Gilbert.. First set of Chips and salsa free and in a small little container of salsa and chips were all broken up.. Service was not great not one refill on drinks for any of us party of four.. Just kept refilling water.. they for got the extra chips we ordered and my husbands salad.. Won't bother coming back\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was my first time at Joyride Taco House, I've been by this restaurant a hundred times and thought it was just another fast food place, kind of tucked behind and between Postinos and Snooze.  This was a very pleasant surprise from the time I walked in the door to meet some friends till the end of the evening.  From drinks at the bar to dinner for 7.   The hostess Emma was beautiful and friendly, seating me at the bar to wait.   As soon as the rest of our party arrived there was no waiting, Emma had our table ready and seated everyone right away on a very busy Friday night.  \n\nDrinks at the bar were generous and the bartenders were awesome working together to make sure I had both food and drink.  Ashlyn delivered my Cheese Y mas which was an amazing appetizer.   Much to my surprise Ashlyn took care of us at the table once my friends arrived.   She was friendly, and an excellent server making sure we had everything full at all time on the table (chips,salsa, water and drinks of we needed them) and made great recommendations for food.   I'll definitely be back...Awesome experience.  The service and employees in this busy restaurant are amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nPricey tacos are good, just pricey.   I am a real fan of the atmosphere, it's like hipster before hipster was cool which made it not cool.  Anyway, fun place to pretend like you're in California where Mexican food is made by sous chefs.  Feels corporate...yet hipster corporate.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food! Wasn't really feeling Mexican food but the restaurant next door had an hour wait and we were hungry. Since we have had Mexican a lot lately I choose the Beet salad which was amazing! Very fresh and yummy! The guacamole was fresh and de lish! Street corn to die for! I had a bite of the  ahi fish tacos and LOVED it! The staff was friendly and accommodating! GM even stopped by our table to say Hi! Water never empty. Great place and we will return!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a not so great experience joyride reached out and is making the situation right which I appreciate. We will be giving this place a second chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpeccable service, great food & fun atmosphere. Tuesday's are taco Tuesday- happy hour all day! That means $2 tacos and great drink prices!! Located in downtown Gilbert right next to a ton of free parking. The only downside is very loud 80s music blasting throughout making it a little difficult to have a conversation.  Otherwise a great place to have an excellent meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would give it three and a half stars but it doesn't let me do that the food was decent the wait time on the food and drinks was not the greatest and the prices are a little high for tacos the place is a little loud but the servers were friendly\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting off with the chips and salsa, I loved both. The atmosphere is cool as others have mentioned. I found zero problem with the service. It was attentive and sufficient. \n\nThe drinks are the best thing. I had the Mexican Mule. \n\nI liked my tacos.  I had a short rib and the pork (called something else to be hip). 2 were enough but they were a bit overpriced for the size. The place is an overall great addition to Gilbert.\n\nUPDATE: From this 1st visit I had some coupons for more tacos and a drink - all FREE. I went back expecting for there to be an up-sell and OK with it.  My friend and I ordered our drinks with alcohol, which should have been extra, I think. At the end, my friend and I asked for the bill but we were told the coupons had taken care of everything. We walked out paying NOTHING (except we left a generous tip for the waitress, of course). \n\nWhat a great way to do business! I'll be back to spend real money. No question.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe absolutely love the atmosphere and the food! They usually have a wait which goes by fast. The bartenders are friendly and the staff is great! The prices are very affordable and they have specials on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy hour is definitely my time to go for cheap bites and refreshing drinks. Joyride always has one lively 2pm-close happy hour on taco Tuesday. The interior of this place is my favorite. It's trendy and fun with relaxing indoor and outdoor seating. We reserved our table on OpenTable, there was about a 15 min wait until we were seated inside. \n\nWe quickly ordered drinks and tacos off the happy hour menu. I got a Strawberry-Hibiscus margarita. I'd say it was an okay drink, I didn't get any hibiscus flavor only a subtle strawberry note. It also wasn't as cold as I'd like it to be, I only drank about half of it. Next were the tacos! I dug into a crispy fish taco, The Standard, and a cranita. All their tacos come on a made in house corn tortilla. I'd say they're more okay than anything real special. There isn't any wow flavors from the masa. The taco fillings themselves weren't bad but also nothing to write home about. I wish the guac had some more flavor and surprises to it. The crispy batter on the fish was my favorite out of the three. We also got rice and beans. The beans were also pretty standard. Although I can't say the same for the rice. It had a strange after taste that I was not a fan of. We had our waitress take it back, she was very sweet and accommodating.\n\nAll in all an okay eating experience. I love how trendy and lively it is here. In terms of the tacos there's better options in Tempe/Phoenix. I'd only come back if friends wanted to drop by.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, the food was very good and deserves four stars. The problem was the service. The server was constantly forgetting to bring us things we had asked so we had to ask the bussers as they passed by. We understood at first since he was taking care of a large party but after they left, he only had us and still was absent!  Having been a restaurant corporate trainer for servers and managed restaurants I tend to be a little more patient than most but this went beyond my patience. I will definitely give them another try since the food was good but hopefully they redeem themselves with their service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went with a large group (8 people) but they weren't overly busy. The host was friendly, seated us, and brought drinks. Unfortunately, these were the only drinks we got all night. We ordered salads, tacos, and nachos; everything was really good. We asked the waitress for refills numerous times.  She would walk away from our table and go stand at the bar, talking. Hands down, worst service ever, which is too bad, because we all thought the food was great. Won't be returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for taco Tuesday, left super satisfied. Some of the best tacos I've ever had for $2 each! I ended up ordering 3, then 4 more to go! The carne asada is some of the best I've had, and that's saying a lot living in AZ. I totally recommend that and the crispy fish! Service and atmosphere was also great!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat nachos!  They're big.  Great grilled Mahi tacos and the house made vanilla pudding is the bomb! Atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon was relaxed and the service is at the top.  We'll definitely will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe absolute perfect place to hang out, eat AMAZING tacos, and have a few margaritas. The servers are very attentive and friendly. Great service even when they are busy. They have a nice outdoor patio with space heaters and a fire place which is a plus. And..... $2 tacos on Tuesday. BOOM!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Joyride for Taco Tuesday!  This was my first time going to the Gilbert location since I typically go the Joyride in Central Phoenix. Nonetheless I had the same great service and same great taste!\n\nTaco Tuesday is just their happy hour special all day long. $5 Margaritas and Mojitos and $2 Tacos. The tacos are great to put something in your stomach for all the drinks you're throwing back!\n\nThey never skimp on the amount of ingredients in the tacos and they always look and smell so good!  My favorite are the carnitas, crispy fish, and the standard. \n\nI love the tropicale margarita. So many flavors and definitely a strong drink.\n\nJoyride has one of the best Taco Tuesdays in Phoenix, hands down!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my all time favorite taco shop! They have an excellent chicken spicy taco thing (chicken tinga) that is fantastic and always leaves me wanting to come back!!! Not to mention their chips and salsa are delicious! The atmosphere is so nice and all the employees are great, I love how they work in a team environment! Seriously, you have to come by and eat some tacos (or nachos) as soon as you can! And by the way.... You can't beat their prices!\n\n\n\n\n\nI came in last Taco Tuesday for the first time in awhile. We were seated in a very timely fashion by the hostess considering it was very busy. I asked for her name and she said \"I go by Fergie here at work.\" She took us outside and made sure everything was right! We let her know our table was wobbly and asked if there was anything she could do about it. She immediately fixed it for us and recommended the Sloe Ride margarita when we asked her which one was the best! We had a fantastic evening and it all started out with the extraordinary service we received when we first walked through the doors. Great job Joyride!! We will definitely be back soon\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a treat to eat here!  The food was good but the customer service was even better. Manager Eric and our Server Alex training Jessica, went way above and beyond to make sure our experience was spot on! Thank you for going above and beyond to get our needs met! You Rock! Guys, come here if you want a fun filled experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarted out with the chips and salsa. Excellent salsa and the chips were very fresh.  We went at 7pm and the lighting in the restaurant was almost non existent. It was VERY difficult to read the menu. I had the beast burrito chimichanga style and it was amazing. We also tried the street corn and it didn't disappoint.  The fish tacos were great.  I especially liked the corn tortillas. This place is a must try.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrispy fish tacos and a pitcher of beer on a nice afternoon while sitting on Joyride's patio is complete luxury. Also unbelievably priced during happy hour; best $10 I could spend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the second time I've come... the first time I've actually been able to get in. Now I see why there was a 1/2 hour wait. The tacos are awesome. I like the Carnitas and the fish\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat dining experience! Tacos were tasty, try the baja fish. The beast burrito was excellent and their carne asada had a ton of flavor. $5 pitchers never hurt anybody's feelings and the mos def dessert (vanilla pudding graham cracker, carmel, walnut miracle) was a solid finish. Friendly staff, enjoyable atmosphere, nice patio and really good music. Awesome visit, thank you Richard and Valerie, we will be back soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the Carne Asada Taco (without the salsa) and a Shrimp Taco, both are Gluten Free and so yummy!!\nThe wait was on the longer side (30 mins or so) around 8pm on a Saturday night.\nOur server was Tim and he was super nice and knowledgeable about what was on the menu.\nBut with the restaurant being so crowded we didn't get service as quickly. \nBut I definitely want to go back (probably during Happy Hour or Taco Tuesday) and try their Blood Orange Margarita, because it sounded so good!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Joyride! Most things I've had are full of flavor, in a simple / understated way. The Fresca's are a must! My fav is the citrus, a super tart / slightly sweet refreshing beverage. Nachos are on point as well! The Mexican Street corn (although looks amazing) isn't that fab.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMAZING. I had a great experience at Joyride. As a proud member of the Arcadia community, I rarely venture out of my bubble, but I'm glad we made the trek all the way out to Gilbert. The little downtown area where Joyride is located is adorable and obviously a hotspot on the weekends. My boyfriend and I came in early on Saturday night, around 5pm, and the place was already packed. The hostesses were very accommodating and showed us over to the bar where we waited for only about 5 minutes before we were shown to our table. Our server Dan was awesome! Super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful in making our dinner decisions. We had carne asada nachos-FREAKING BOMB-the ahi stack-refreshing and very tasty-Mexican street corn-DELISH-and an assortment of tacos, all of which were fantastic-my fave was the shrimp. And here's a helpful tip, if you join their \"eposse\" they send awesome coupons, our appetizers were completely free! It's safe to say I highly recommend this place and that I'll be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe menu was somewhat eclectic and unique. I thought the portions were small they were certainly a buzz of people. I thought it was a little overpriced for the food that I got. Don't go in looking for traditional tacos I'm not sure they'll make them for you\n\n\n\n\n\nGood food and good drinks! The place had a great atmosphere and great service. I loved the pork tacos!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot that great, especially for what you get, everything is a la cartel so can be very pricey\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family and I came for taco Tuesday, and we got all around great service and food. First they provided is a spot to park our stroller because it didn't fit by our table. We ordered and the food came quickly, the sissy refills were on point too (I believe our servers name was Taylor). I had three tacos with three different types of meat which were delicious. The carnitas was my favorite. The tortillas even seemed hand made. The place had really cool art on the wall. I saw some Star Wars stuff which is always cool. The only thing I kinda bothered me was that the music was too loud because it took away from having a conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendly wait staff. Food was okay. The desert brownies with ice cream and spiced walnuts were absolutely off the charts. Would go for drinks and desert at minimum!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWas eating chips and salsa and bit into a thin 3 inch wire! The waitress just said sorry and brought new salsa. No comp was given for anything and spent 50 dollars on two people. For the amount you shouldn't be finding metal in your food.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for the first time yesterday. Food and service all around were very good, BUT, out of absolute necessity, I had to bring my dog (I live 2 hours away) and sit on their north side patio. Although their misting system was on, the owner needs to add more misters, or put fans out there or do something. Overhead fans would have been nice. The flies were ridiculous, I have no idea where they were coming from, we could hardly eat our food, VERY unsanitary. It was very hot out there and needless to say, I will never eat on their patio in the summertime again. Also, that patio needs some type of fencing in case your dog gets away from you. No fence at all there. No to their patio.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thought the food had very good  flavor. Ingredients were quality and service was good. Worth a try if you haven't been here.\n\n\n\n\n\nShelby was awesome.  It was our first time there.  She recommended the perfect sides and tacos.  Definitely will be back. They had us at 5 dollar pitchers of beer .\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat customer service. I went with a friend of mine that has food allergies and ordered the vegetarian platter and did not see it came with beans (part of his allergies) when we told the server we messed up he worried more about us  having a great experience then the cost of the food, comped the mistake and the remake. Places don't just do that anymore. Then we went up to the bar and the bar tenders are just as personable, when we asked for a shot that they didn't have the stuff for they improvised, and introduced us to a new shots we have never had and ended up being amazing. Thanks Chase! Great place to visit or repeat.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding food and customer service. If you haven't tried this place, then you must. I love the vintage atmosphere. They have beautiful seating outside too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food is nice. I found the portions to be rather small. The salsa and chips were fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is cute. This is more of a bar with tables, at least it seemed so the Friday lunch I ate there. The noise level was way to high for me. A table next to ours complained but I did not notice any change\n\n\n\n\n\nI also wanted to write a great review of this place. Especially when they opened the sliding doors and it was such a great night. First of all i remember all too well the old saying \"if its too loud, your too old\"! Yep, im too old. Perhaps its because its partly a bar but i really don't want to eat with really loud music. I'll drink with really loud music. But i don't want agita! ( thats my old Italian lady word). Off the bat the chips were way salty. That may just be me. Im kind of salt sensitive. I was excited for the tomatillo salsa since its not easy to get. Disappointed, it was bland and had an off taste. My daughter had 2 tacos. One beef, one pork. She downed them both. Preferring the pork. They looked great. I had the tamales with rice and veggies. The rice was bland but i was starving. The veggies standard but tasty. The tamale was extremely tasty and saved the meal for me. Also, the staff was easy going, not rushed and ver accommodating.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've had a few family members say this isn't their favorite spot, but we loved it! Really great atmosphere and DELICIOUS tacos! Street corn was also very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nService, food and drinks are all great here. Atmosphere is pretty trendy and the patio is great. Happy hour is before 5 each day.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame in later for drinks and dessert. 10pm-ish. They prepared my fianc's whiskey perfectly.  I had the horchata w/o alcohol.  Good horchata!\n\nI tried the churros. They were excellent!  Not greasy at all!  Someone knows how to fry!  They had a perfect amount of cinnamon and sugar. The chocolate dipping sauce was good  I think I would have preferred a vanilla cream custard to dip them in though. \n\nGreat vibe, good music.  Felt like I was in another town. I love the atmosphere there.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love that Gilbert is getting more and more non-chain restaurants and the food is fresh and tasty.  The wait to get in could be twice as long and still enjoyable because of the outdoor seating/setting.\n\nHowever, the service was not good at all.  Our waitress was rude and kept explaining that they didn't know how to handle a crowd this big.  It was Saturday afternoon and busy but not overwhelmingly so in my opinion.\n\nMy sister asked if she could order a bowl of fruit for one of the kids, and the waitress said no that's not allowed because it has to go through the kitchen.  Um, my sister didn't ask to get it for free or to get it before the rest of the meal.\n\nWe asked for chips and salsa and the reply was Seriously you'll get them when they're ready.  Lots of people want them and they aren't ready yet.  Again...um...it was a question.  We weren't even irritated to have not gotten them yet.  It was a request.\n\nAnd, the night went on with a defensive waitress who was either new, in over her head or recently screamed at by too many other tables that her reflex was always defensive.\n\nBy the end of the night she seemed to realize she needed to warm up to my sister if she wanted a tip because she was finally somewhat friendly when she dropped off the bill.\n\nHad the waitress been friendly and the noise level a bit lower overall, I would definitely give this place more stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nI come here all the time . It's one of my favorite places. The decor is lovely and the music is always good. The food is delish but can be pricey. Happy hour is from 2-6 and I highly recommend going at that time. The nachos are amazing. The service at the bar can be hit or miss. They are always busy and they can tend to be inattentive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service, food and ambiance was amazing. For the love of God, please get the Crispy Fish Taco!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Happy hour prices and food. Margaritas and fish tacos to die for. I will visit next time I am in Arizona.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen placing an order to go, make sure you double check your order before you leave. The staff is not competent enough to make sure it's right.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame for my birthday. Gotta say I just expected a delicious taco with all the hype.... This is a super trendy taco joint, great vibe, great customer service. However the food was a let down. The tacos are piled with stuff that takes away from the little akward flavor the meats had. The best thing I absolutely loved is the corn tortillas it came on. They seemed fresh and homemade. For the price you are paying I was expecting authentic bomb street tacos, instead I paid for what looked like art in a tortilla, it looked nice but wasnt up to par with the taco cart in Juarez. It was a big disappointment when you can get a better taco from a taco cart, then you can from this potentially awesome restaurant. So if your into food photography this is the best place to snap some pics, if you are craving a authentic bomb taco, look elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Joyride! Great atmosphere, great food, great service. This is a fun date-night kind of place or good to go with a small group as well. The fish tacos are delicious, their beet salad is exceptional as well. I wanted to love the tortilla soup but sadly was disappointed with that, but this place is a Taco House, and they do tacos well so that's alright with me! My husband loves their burritos, and their agua frescas are delicious. Get the strawberry one and add Malibu Rum...you won't be disappointed! :) Update: they took all their Ahi Tuna dishes off the menu (appetizers, tacos), which was my favorite thing to order there sometime last year. Haven't been back as frequently and hoping they bring those dishes back! They were awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is now our favorite Mexican restaurant in Gilbert. Great ambiance, friendly and helpful service, and delicious food. Blood orange margarita and horchata with amaretto were amazing. Tacos and quesadilla were flavorful and generous portions. Really good choice! Recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone RAVES about this place. I finally went, met a friend who told me we should meet up at 11:30 right before it gets packed and so we did. We had a choice of tables and was seated promptly. Water, chips and Salsa were delivered right away. Our server introduced herself and was very attentive. The food is fresh and the tacos are very traditional mexican soft tacos.\n\nWe started with an order of Guacamole which I thought was very good, fresh avocado, could of used a little more seasoning, but I ate with the salsa and was good. My friend had ordered the 2 taco (Crispy Fish and Ahi Tuna) and salad (Ensalada Fila) special. She loves this place. I had ordered the 3 tacos (Shrimp, Crispy Fish and Baja Fish) and mine came with a choice of side, so the Black Beans it was. Honestly the food was good service and atmosphere good. I just can't get over the markup in pricing. Its trendy marketing: catchy name, cute place good food, but come on guys its a Taco Joint! With the 3 taco +side, and order of Guacamole and a Corona beer with tip $31.\n\nSo with that said and done. I\"m glad I tried it myself and I would go back only if I was meeting people and that was the restaurant vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing... the servers are SUPER helpful and courteous! You can get drinks while you wait!!!...just dont go down the stairs LOL oops... and there are misters and seating while you wait too! Definitely worth the wait and the 5 stars!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here enough times to say that this is a perfectly fine place to hang out. The service is great, the restaurant is actually very nicely designed, from what I've heard the cocktails are pretty delicious, and refills on chips are free. \n\nThat said, I have never enjoyed the food. I've had a chimichanga, tamales, and a couple of different side items, all of which I felt either lacked flavor or were more money than they were worth. The cheese and chorizo side is good if you don't mind spending $9 on queso dip, but the beans, tamales, and burritos I've had have inspired a resounding \"meh\" in me.\n\nTaking on the moniker of a taco house was an ambitious move in a city like Phoenix. If they called themselves \"Mod Living Room with Patio, Cocktails and Chips,\" I would find the branding more honest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fish taco was delish.  Carne asada was a bit dry.  I thought the cucumber fresca would be really refreshing but it tasted like a cleanse juice, which did not bring back good memories.  The horchata was way too sweet.  The environment was a cool 70's vibe.  All in all it was okay.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoy, do I love this place!  My husband and I went on Saturday night with another couple and we were blown away.   All the tacos were great but the scallop, carne asada, baja and short rib were our favorites.  I am still thinking about the Mexican Street Corn the day after.  Amazing.  You would never know that this restaurant has not even been open for a week.  Can't wait to come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for dinner and the choices for someone on diet restrictions is terrible. Normally I can adjust something to fit what i am looking for. I ordered chicken burrito but placed in a bowl and asked if I could have lettuce and no rice to make more of a salad. All the salads had grains and I am trying to stay low-carb.  I even mentioned this to the waitress and there was not problem.  My meal came very little lettuce a lot of corn and very little chicken.  I ate the chicken out of the bowl and when the waitress came back and saw my bowl pushed away instead of asking it there was a problem or anything she just asked if I was done. The taste of the food was nothing to right home about chicken well just chicken.  I can say overall experience was not good.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious tacos, and amazing service! Any place with free chips and salsa is a keeper in my book! I love street tacos and I plan on loving them from\nJoyride more often!!! Mmm mmm delicious!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nChase and the girl with the septum piercing were awesome. Love this place for the great food and awesome service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here once before, had the nachos and, meh, had better.  But decided to give it another try.  Thursday, 5:00, there were plenty of people but not extremely busy.  It was pretty clear that the waitress was new, but she was pleasant and smiled, she just needs more practice.\nWe had tacos.  LUV... the shredded beef and the crunchy fish.  SO GOOD, lots of flavor.  So much better than Queen Barrio we tried several weeks ago.  Just thinking about this, I am ready to go back for some more tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband visited this place yesterday for lunch it was great!  He had the chicken tacos and I had the grilled fish tacos and they were excellent.  We both had the Joy Ride Margaritas and they were, by far, some of the best ones we've ever had. Fun atmosphere, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I tried Joyride on Saturday for date night. It exceeded my expectations! From tasty unique cocktails to authentic and delicious street tacos and street corn, we we very pleased. Many restaurants in the Heritage District are busy on Saturday night at 7pm, but we found seats quickly at the bar and didn't mind. I am guessing a little earlier would have garnered us a table. I can't wait to take family there when they visit town next month.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved this place! The restaurant was nice and clean and the decor was really unique! The food was awesome, I had the crispy fish tacos and 1 veggie taco. The veggie wasn't my favorite to be honest but everything else about this place was on point!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food and great service! I usually go for happy hour. The pineapple mojito or the traditional marg is my favorite. Cant beat $2 tacos. Chips and salsa are great as well..although it is kind of silly that they started charging for a refill on that! :)\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friends arrived from the east coast and we were all hungry on a Friday night. I wanted to take them somewhere nice that is not swarmed with college students. Everywhere was closed at this point or not serving drinks. The manager there opened the kitchen just to make us dinner even though it was last eleven. He was really awesome about it. On top of that he gave us a half off discount. Not only that but the waitress, waiter, and everyone that worked there was super friendly. I have not had service like this on years. The food was also delicious. love this place! Love their food! Love their service!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've now eaten here twice and tried all of their tacos. Joyride has amazing food, amazing staff and the cutest decor! \n\nI like to sit outside on the patio- which often puts you at risk for being forgotten- but not here! The staff is bubbly, helpful and checks in often! \n\nEverything I have tried here has been gorgeous, the presentation and flavor of each dish makes it hard to choose- but my favorites right now are the standard chicken and baja fish tacos!\n\nI also would like decorate my house like that place haha! \nI think I will try the agua fresca next time :)\n\n\n\n\n\nI went today for happy hour, my friends and I were less than happy. We ordered food that never came. I had one happy hour drink and the waitress asked my friend if she wanted another round and walked off without asking me, my drink was empty. Then 30 minutes pass and the server said \"oh did you not get your margarita\" to my friend. So we both asked for a drink then about another 30 minutes go by before we got our drinks and her response was \"I'll make sure you don't get charged double for your drinks\". Well I sure hope not! Then about 45 minutes to an hour pass with ZERO service, and another server stopped by asking if we were ready for our check. She cashed us out, we have no idea what happened to our server. One of the worst experiences I've ever had! Other people have told me that the service has become terrible there, but we gave it a shot anyways, bad idea! Myself and my friends all said we will never go back there again!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally, I LOVE Joyride, but I was so disappointed to see they've literally shrunk their kid meals. The bean and cheese burrito meal was made using taco tortillas. My 3 year old and 5 year old finished their meals before mine even came out (yes, all ordered at the same time) and were still hungry, so I asked to order two more burritos. They said they only sell the meal, so, $20 later ($5/meal x 2 kids x 2 meals), my kids were finally full. So disappointing!\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this type of place exists in east valley suburbia.  But I wasn't impressed, especially being an Upward concept.  This was my first time visiting.  Food was good, overpriced for the demographic  and offerings in my option, but a nice selection of options no less.  The service on the other hand, terrible.  We had to continually ask for drinks until we took matters into our own hands and went to the bar directly.  This shouldn't be the case when you're seated in the dining area.  Waiter didn't follow up when the food arrived, and a side of salsa that was requested when the order went in, took asking 4 times!  \n\nI will drive the extra mile to visit other Upward concepts, but wouldn't patron this place again based on the service experience, or really, lack there of.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbiance was fun, food was great (don't miss the Mexican street corn). Staff was friendly and attentive.\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW, wish I had taken pictures! I was sure hungry and this place hit the spot!!  Delicious roasted salsa & tomitillo salsa, I had the nachos with Carne asada meat, huge serving the left overs will be calling my name tomorrow. Yum yum yum, \nMy Friends ordered tacos, shrimp ceviche, mexican street corn.  I will definitely visit this establishment again.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday night 7pm\n\nFood: excellent, no nonsense presentation carnitas, fish and  pork tacos were delicious, not over-marinated or so stuffed w extra stuff that you wondered if there was any meat.  Very Tasty. Very Filling.  Kale salad also delicious...new favorite since Zinburger no longer offers a kale salad.  Get the Mexican corn appetizer.  It's messy but oh so delicious! CHips standard--warm and crispy, salsa excellent (flavorful, smoky. We went through three bowls!). \n\nDrinks: excellent.  Margaritas are yummy \n\nService: above par especially for as BUSY as it was\nWait time: reasonable for a busy Friday night (just under 30 min)...hostess was amazing during the wait. Indoor and outdoor seating with roll up bay doors for ventilation when needed. \n\nNoise level: extreme. Difficult to hear general conversation, background music added to the noise level. (Not a restaurant for romantic whispering!) Great place for gathering of friends. Fun atmosphere, great food and drinks   \n\nJoyride is excellent....indoors needs a noise dampening system but overall great atmosphere, excellent food and drinks and service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome restaurant with a good ambiance.  We eat here at least twice a month!  I almost selfishly hesitated to post this review because it's already so popular it's already crowded; but, it's worth the wait!  Check out the Mexican Street Corn, it's the best thing on the menu!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat happy hour drinks on Tuesday cool atmosphere. Sat at the bar and was immediately greeted and got our drinks and food quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all I hate comments from people who have no clue about the restaurant business. Don't go out to eat if you are in a hurry.\n\nSitting and the ambiance is great. Large place with a ton of seating. I am not eating here but I'm drinking here. The cucumber Serrano is great. My wife is drinking agua fresca with vodka and its great. I will update the post when I eat here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad lunch at Joyride after working a booth at the Gilbert Art Walk.  Awesome food but staff was just wonderful.  I think we met everyone.  there was a minor (very minor) issue and everyone went so far out of their way to make up, it was very generous.  Our drinks were never empty\nand again the food was just awesome.  Thank you all so much for helping us artist wind down and celebrate a successful day!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place! The standard taco is the best! My husband also really likes the crunchy fish taco.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrendy. Expensive. Loud. Tuesdays is your best bet because beef tacos are a couple of dollars versus typical prices any other day. Everything else in the menu is pricy but good. Not family oriented, unless you like to be screaming at your kids.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place to check off you're list in the Gilbert area. It can get quite busy with a 30-45min wait at times. So plan accordingly. I think the food is a TAD bit over priced as far as the quantity you get. Service and ambience is what this place is known for I think. I'm one of those super tall guys that can eat a lot. They don't have a crazy entre that fills me up completely. I go for what they have to offer though: The Beast Burrito. The 1st batch of Chips and Salsa are complimentary (they used to be all free though :/)\n\n\n\n\n\nTried this place out after finding it while in the downtown Gilbert area, went for HH and the prices were good and he food and service was great. We tried multiple tacos and the veggie burrito and everything was really good. Even the chips and salsa surpassed expectations, although a side note on that, only the first basket/bowl is free. Plenty of options we will definitely be going back and soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is a really neat spot in downtown Gilbert! The staff is friendly and it's a very cool atmosphere. The downside is that's it's VERY loud! Other than that, I enjoy it!\n\n\n\n\n\nWaited 45 minutes to have our server check on us once, no water refills, ignored our table multiple times, and said nothing as she set our check down. Watched multiple tables around us get served, and checked on. Go to Barrio Queen.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving been favorably impressed by other of the Upward restaurants, I looked forward to my first visit to this new addition in north central Phoenix. I was not much impresssed.  The service was more aggressive than attentive without really being service-oriented.  Servers and bussers were quick to remove drink glasses, for instance, but not to inquire if we wanted another drink.  When the food arrived, our order was incorrect.  The salad we had ordered was replaced by a side of rice, and it took an inordinate amount of time to correct this. Companion and I were halfway through our entrees when the correct salad finally arrived.  I really like Mexican food,  but I was not impressed with the selections we ordered. The oranges in the orange and cucumber salad tasted canned.  The tacos were small and bland.  The chicken burrito was barely warm, tasted like boiled chicken in mayonnaise sauce.  I got the impression of Mexican food for people who do not like Mexican food.  We will give it another chance, maybe just for drinks after work, but not for the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite spots in downtown Gilbert.  I love the inside outside feel. You can't beat the taco Tuesday deal!! Go for the Tomatillo (green) hot sauce.  It's a little less spicy.\n\n\n\n\n\nalways so busy - but amazing food. I love the dcor and the service has always been great. This was a great restaurant to add to downtown gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nBless this taco house and it's delicious Mexican food. If there is such thing as Mexican comfort food, it's this place. It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but its worth a little bit of a wait. We usually only end up waiting like 15 min when it's most busy. \n\nEvery time we go we get the 3-taco deal, and an appetizer. Trust me, it's PLENTY of food. I think I've tried each of the tacos,  but my favorites are the fish and machaca ones. Also pro tip: you can switch out the corn tortillas for flour tortillas, when you're not feeling the corn. \n\nThe guacamole and queso are SO delish. I promise you won't regret getting either of them. I love this place and can't wait to see it's continued growth!\n\n\n\n\n\nSaying that this restaurant sucks is probably the nicest thing I can even come up with! The food was boring but expensive. The soda was flat the entire night and our drinks would sit empty for 20 minutes before anyone would think to refill them.  The service was absolutely horrible and to top it off when we paid our bill the server also ran my card for someone else's meal. Instead of giving me a heads up that they made a mistake I found out the next day when balancing my check book.  When we contacted the restaurant to make sure that the transaction was canceled the manager told us he would call us back the next morning because they were very busy.  No big deal until the phone call didn't come. When we called back to follow up you could tell that the manager was annoyed that we were asking him to verify that the $70 transaction was canceled.  The least that could have been done was an apology but that never came! I will make sure that nobody in my family or group of friends ever return to this restaurant!\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic all around. We're in town for a week and we went twice. The $5 margaritas and pitchers for happy hour are a great deal, that's even before you get to the food. Had tacos, queso and burritos and they were all top notch. The place has a great vibe. We might be back for a third round later this week! Service was friendly and prompt both times we went.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a fun place with good food, great service, and a nice outdoor patio.  If you go during happy hour (4:00-6:00), most of their $3.75-$4.50 tacos are only $2.  And these aren't ordinary tacos.  They're stuffed to overflowing with lean meat and a variety of veggies.  I had The Standard (slow roasted chicken, slaw, and avocado) and pork adoba (shredded pork, cabbage, radish, cilantro).  My friend had a carne asada taco and a grilled shrimp one.\n\nWe asked about sharing sides, but it was suggested we get our own.  I agree about the Mexican corn.  My friend said it was the best corn she ever had.  We both ate every last kernel out of our bowls.  It was grilled on the cob, which can be removed if you request, then mixed with cojita cheese, a little mayo, and paprika.  Soooo good!\n\nOn that orange and cucumber salad, two people could easily share it, unless you have a craving to eat an entire English cucumber by yourself.  Besides a few orange pieces and light dressing, there was nothing else. \n\nThe service was very good, very attentive even before we asked. Even the salsa that came with the chips was excellent.  We would have liked to try Mo's Definitely dessert, but were too full.  However, worth another trip just for that.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly cow this place was so bomb. First off, everyone needs to get the almond horchata. I don't trust a person who tries the joyride horchata and doesn't like it. The tacos are unbelievably tasty. Literally, doesn't matter which one you get. Orgasm in your mouth. Make sure you get the habanero salsa also if you are a spicy fan. It does spicy salsa justice, and then some. Can't wait to come down and get more tacos!!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyed a nice lunch here with friends when I was in Gilbert on a recent weekend. We just walked up. No reservations. We waited just a short time (maybe 5 mins) for our table out on the patio for 9 to be set up. Service from the hostess to our server and the countless others that either brought our orders or refilled our drinks was friendly. They have a lot of young college-aged staff and I thought their customer service was excellent.\n\nchips and salsa on the table as soon as you sit down... I went with a pineapple agua fresca. it was refreshing. kinda perfect on a warm day. \n\nI ordered the 3 taco combo. I went with pork adobada, crispy fish and braised beef. The pork adobada was deliciously guajillo simmered pork served with cabbage, radishes & onions. no cilantro for me in any of these orders. it was a real good taco especially with all the handmade tortillas. the crispy fish taco was excellent, it was a white fish beer battered & fried and served with guacamole, slaw in a white flour tortilla. yumm. the braised beef was served with avocado, cabbage, radish and onions. it was also very tasty. i was happy with all that i had ordered. my order came with a side and i went with the tomato rice but i found it to be a bit lacking in flavor. that was the only downer. everything else was great. \n\nwe celebrated my nephew's 15th birthday at joy ride and we ordered him a caramel brownie. i didnt have any but it looked great. im sure it was as delicious as advertised... i look forward to eating here next time i'm in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nStumbled in here on a work trip and I am glad I did.  I had tacos and beer only.  Tacos were so good I had 6!  To make it better it was taco Tuesday so 2 beers and 6 GOOD tacos only $20.  Ill come back for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the fish, carnitas, and carne asada tacos. The carne asada tacos were the best, although they didn't taste anything what I expected. They were kind of sweet. What really makes the tacos are the homemade tortillas which are fresh and perfect.\nChips were cold and not good at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat margaritas, delicious tacos, even better salads. This place is a regular weekend chill spot for me and the wife. Fast and attentive staff makes for an enjoyable experience. I go to this location about twice a month, they never disappoint, and are consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place fails in terms of flavor. I ordered the tacos and was not impressed at all by their flavor or price. You pay for the atmosphere here. It is a very hip place and probably makes for great instagram photos, but if you are looking for serious food this is not the place. I tried 6 different taco flavors and all were weak. I give it 2 stars for the atmosphere. Went once and will probably never return.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food. Great vibe!\n\nCan't wait to get some more Short Rib Tacos and Orange Cucumber salad appetizer. It would be 5 stars but the service was attentive but slow and confused (I think they had to many staff people) but that I know will improve with time. I can't wait to try other dishes and drinks. The menu looks TASTY.  The decor was great and comfortable. \n\nIt was hard to identify employees from customers since they don't have anything on to identify them as an employee.  \n\nI can't wait for it to cool down and be able to sit outside.  Looks really nice out there.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had other dinner plans, but the husband wanted to detour here instead. I grudgingly agreed, and put on my best \"Sure, Honey!\" face. I was repaid for my spousal compromise by being served the best Mexican food I've had in a long time!\n\n*Chips and salsa- Good quality chips, salsa had the perfect amount of heat. (At least for me.)\n*Carne asada quesadilla- Great tortilla, a delicious cheese blend, and moist, flavorful carne asada. \n*I snagged some of my son's black beans. Loved the flavor!\n*The downtown Gilbert ambience is always crackling with tons of restaurants, happy people etc.\n\nNow I'm definitely plotting a return trip!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur experience at Joyride was disappointing. We showed up and were seated within 10 minutes(the only good thing that happened). When our waiter came to take our order, my friend and I, ordered soft drinks. The waiter said they were running next door to borrow some, and that he would have them out to use in a couple minutes. After he took our order, we asked about our drinks again. He said that he would go get them. The waiter seemed like he was too busy and focusing on everything else. We waited about 15 minutes for our food to come out . After we got our food we asked another waiter if he could get us our drinks. He said that he would go back and check on them. Food was okay. Tacos are overpriced, and the side was bland. After eating, we asked for the check. He charged us for the drinks that we never received. The manager came over, covered in food, and told us that she would take care of the drinks on the check. She brought us back our check, and said that she had given us $5 off for the inconvenience. The drinks were still on the check, so all this did was take of the cost of the drink. \nNobody on staff seemed happy or like they even wanted to be there, including management. We will not be returning to Joyride.\n\n\n\n\n\nService is great, no denying that but the food is so mediocre I cringed while eating my tacos, which is their supposed specialty. I will say though, their tortillas are fresh and taste great with a good texture as they don't get soggy and blow out the bottom. Anyway, I had the fish taco, pork adobaba, and carnitas. The fish to batter ratio was a little weak and the batter seemed to take up more space in the shell than the fish itself and the taste didn't meet my expectation of freshness. The adobaba and carnitas could've been the same taco as far as I was concerned. They were probably the same meat, which had the texture of pulled pork, but the adobaba had a sauce that resembled in look and taste as a failed attempt at tex mex BBQ sauce (although tex-mex is a failed attempt at cuisine, imho). I wasn't a fan as you might imagine. My friend ordered vegetable enchiladas and they were much better than I was expecting, decent red and green enchilada sauce, oaxacan cheese and a nice array of vegetables. Margaritas are good, $5 pitchers of beer before 5:00 everyday, free chips and salsa great service just lacking in the authenticity or even just a little flare in the food department. Probably won't go back. In fact, So cal tacos across the street is twice as good I'd say.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tacos - loud so you can bring the kids. Great service - always a perfect place for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped in for their $5 house margaritas.  On ice my first one went down quick and did not really feel it but did start to feel a kick halfway through my second one.  So they passed my margarita test. \n\nCrispy and fresh chips and very savory salsa were offered and they are really really.good.  \n\nThen not being so hungry i ordered just the fish taco, no rice or beens.  Satisfying and tasty.  \n\nThe bar was pleasant and not crowded at the time and the bartenders were very attentive and nice.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't go unless you are ready to wait for no one to know you are there. Extremely slow serving, I had 5-10 people walk by us before WE had to ask to get a drink. Then 15-20min later, WE had to ask about getting a food order in. We sat at the bar.\nThe place itself is a great looker, but the service is what's going to keep me away. Will not try this over priced taco house again.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk service and food. Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 2pm-6pm and the deals are good, but other places sell tastier tacos for less i.e. Los Taquitos. Waiter was very slow and forgot my drink a couple of times. Starter chips and salsa are free and tasty. Mexican corn was good as were the nachos. Carne asada and crispy fish tacos were average. Patio seating is pet friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here at least ten times, and just getting around to a review. We love this place! It's affordable, the food is always spot on, the service is consistently friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere leaves you feeling relaxed and happy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent food, drinks are good, nice ambiance.  Service and food has been  hit or miss  for me. I love tacos but this isn't  my to go to place.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday was my first time at this restaurant. I went to the Gilbert location with some girlfriends. The atmosphere was really cool, good happy hour, and the menu looked interesting. There was chips and salsa ( which was good and surprisingly spicy) waiting for me thankfully because I was starving. The guacamole appetizer was good (kind of hard to screw up guacamole). My friend got some beans as an appetizer, they were basically \"crunchy\" and inedible. The server was so nice and cute about it, she took them and didn't charge us, but she handled it very gracefully and it wasn't awkward, which is usually the case in that situation. I got a Bloody Mary, which was just ok, a little overly salty. My friends loved their margaritas though. I got a salad which was delicious, the girls got tacos and were so impressed (so many options!). Dessert was also a hit, which was some banana pudding Carmel pecan thing in a jar, yum! I will definitely be going back, for $2 taco Tuesday!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere, modern aesthetic, killer guac, great food! Service was receptive without being overbearing, Kat was friendly and bubbly! Margarita was refreshing but a tad on the sweet side. Nothing negative to say, great spot for happy hour\n\n\n\n\n\nReally wasn't impressed with the size or flavor of the tacos especially for the price. We had the standard, Carne asada, and grilled fish and none of them were particularly amazing. Loved the atmosphere but unfortunately wouldn't be back due to the lackluster food. \n\nAlso, it would be nice if they told you Taco Tuesday doesn't start until 2 pm. I called to ask which tacos were included but they didn't bother to mention the time. Was pretty perturbed to show up at 1:30 to find we had to pay full price.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a mediocre experience.\n\nMy friends and I had a reservation for 8 at 7pm.  We were seated immediately upon arrival on a busy Friday night in the patio area.  Our waiter was nice and made good suggestions.  The food is just okay; nothing to brag about.  The tacos are very expensive for what they give you (average price is $4 for a SINGLE small street style taco a la carte).  The tacos come out on a rack family-style.  So while in the dark environment of the patio and main dining area, you pay $4 for a tiny taco and have to search all over the table to find your taco (RIDICULOUS- the waiter tells you all the tacos on the rack and then you go racing to find yours).  The drinks are average for their prices.\n\nAfter dining, my friends and I were chatting at the table and catching up (pretty normal post dining activity).  About 8:30pm, a hostess asked us to leave our table as they had to accommodate a reservation at 8:45pm.  WOW....I don't think I have EVER been asked to leave a restaurant.  She hostess did ask in a nice manner and handed out coupons for free tacos as to make up for asking us to leave. \n\nWe ended moving our party to the outside of the restaurant to continue chatting.  By 9:30PM, no party had ever been seated at our table!   \n\nI will never return to this restaurant.  Paying over $40 for 2 tacos and 2 drinks and being rudely asked to leave my table is just not worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is hit or miss for me. The fish taco's were great, but I don't think I would go out of my way to go here. There is nothing wrong with it, and most of the food was good, but the portions are kind of weak.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here tonight with my wife. The  dcor is cool, the service is first rate and the tacos are delicious. The street food size portions are fine, but the guys might wish the tacos were a little bit larger. The taste is excellent. They have chips and a really nice salsa waiting for you when you get to your table. Nice idea. I had the shrimp taco and the carne asada taco and the crispy fish taco. All of them were great. I liked the crispy fish the best. My wife loved the margaritas. Our waiter Justin did an outstanding job. The wait staff, are everywhere and they didn't miss a beat when we were there.   Make the tacos a little bit bigger and this place is a definite 5 star all day long. We will definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride tacos were amazing and being Hispanic I can honestly say they are very authentic the salsa is amazing and their black beans are really really good! I was there to days in a row! The carne Asada tacos were my favorite I did not care for the breaded fish but I got a taco replaced without charge which was really really nice the service was excellent and the atmosphere was Great! I would definitely go there again!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe people that brought  you Postino's, Federal Pizza,Chelsea's Kitchen  have done it again!  \n\nWe went on a Sunday at noon.  We had excellent service with numerous servers checking on us throughout the meal. I'm a New Yorker, husband is a Londoner and we really get crazed when the service isn't good and this was not the case!  Service was top notch!\n\nThe tacos were terrific. I  had Grilled Shrimp, Baja Fish and Ahi Tuna and loved them and I'm not even a Mexican food lover.    Hubby had Carne Asada, Shredded Beef and I think Chicken Tinja and he thought everything was delicious. \n\nThe music was great - Cat Stevens to Prince to Sting and not too loud like Federal Pizza.  The interior is a well designed cool urban space.\n\n\n\n\n\nHip atmosphere, hip employees, hip music, hip location, mediocre food at Rockefeller prices.  Meh.\n\n\n\n\n\nDowntown Gilbert is trying to step up their game with all these new places to eat. if tacos are your thing Joyride is a great place to go. They have a taco for everyone and are happy to make a taco any way you want it. My fav is the shrimp and my hubs was the braised beef. The tortilla soup was delish. Nice atmosphere, clean, but service was a bit slow and I was confused about who my server was. Two nice outdoor patios. Ill go back....I like tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went back today because I was craving the chips and salsa! I stumbled upon a beautiful little money saving sign at the table for a lunch deal :) Any two tacos and half a salad or soup for $9.95. I ordered the shrimp and ahi taco. Both delicious of course. But I am here to praise about the fila salad. The fila salad blew my mouth and mind, it has kale as a base  with jicama, oranges, tomato, avocado, pinto beans, corn, crunchy peas + queso fresco in a quince vinaigrette. It's definitely worth a try! \n\nI had fantastic service. My water was not even a quarter empty and it was refilled, twice! The place had people in there but it was not during peak times or super busy by any means. I am already planning my next trip but next time starting with dessert.\n\n\n\n\n\nI give the place 2 stars total.  \n\nThe place gets 5 stars for the atmosphere.  It's a good spot to meet people or take a date.  There is music playing and after awhile it starts to get a little loud.  The place was busy on a Thursday night.  The whole area was busy, gilbert is making their own little busy down town.\n\nThe food I give a 1 star.  The taste was ok but for the price it should have been better.  The beef had some fatty stuff.  The chicken and pork was ok.  The waitress bragged about the tacos and that they made the tortillas in house.  The tortillas were soft on the inside and edges were dehydrated.  The horchata was not that great, too much cinnamon. \n\nThe bill for 2 of us was $40 which i thought was over priced.   I will not be going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first visit. Great place.  I had the tacos and they were excellent.  Love the fresh made and thick corn tortillas. The fillings were awesome as well.  I had chicken, carnitas and pork adobada... all flavored very well with creative extras like radishes and cilantro and Mexican slaw. My wife had the chicken burrito bowl. Huge serving of scrumptious and creative flavors. The squash and chicken were perfectly cooked. Service was top notch, as we had four different people stop by to help, bring food, refills, etc.\n\nWe will definitely return.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went in on a Sunday night, just two of us. The Service was slow, the food was okay, my drink wasn't great and the waitress figured she would just add my tip to the bill for me with her mediocre service. Wouldn't go back if I lived in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the tacos here. They are street tacos and you can get them just about anyway you like. I have to mention the charred habanero salsa. Wow is all I can say. It is hot (it is habanero after all) but that charred part just adds some super flavor to it. The staff was super friendly and as we waited for a table outside they had a server taking and bringing drink orders. That is awesome and all restaurants should be that way. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wait was longer than we would have liked, and we ended up getting in sooner than expected after we negotiated with the hostess. The food was great though!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food.  Service so so.  2nd time there.  Waited a bit for drinks order,  never got a refill on salsa. Just ok service.  Hoping for a better experience next time...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing! Just writing this review is making me hungry. First, the ambiance is awesome. The decor is fun and trendy and they play great music. It is a fantastic place to just relax and grab a bite with friends. The staff are all friendly and the customer service is great. They're quick to refill your drinks and if anything is wrong with your order (only happened to us once, forgot the enchilada sauce on a burrito) they are quick to fix it. \n\nWe ordered a taco trio (carne asada, chicken tinga, & Baja fish) they were all fantastic but the carne asada was by far the favorite. The bomb black beans that came with the tacos were amazing! Seriously, for something as simple as black beans they were so tasty. My husband got The Beast burrito enchilada style with red and green sauce. That was delicious too. The Pork Adobado Torta was absolutely amazing! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The toasted bread was perfect with the saucy meat and the side salad that came with it was a perfect light complement to the heaviness of the sandwich. \n\nAll in all, an awesome place, can't say enough great things about it! Can't wait to go back and try something new. If the trend continues, I'm sure whatever I pick from the menu next will be stellar.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood! Tacos were a nice new type of flavor I haven't had before. Cool and interesting decor. Recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\nsurprised that their carne asada stood out to me. their carnitas was also good but asada took the show. has that charbroiled taste but tender and not too salty. went on taco tuesday and $2 a taco was soo cheap for the quality. nothing extra here, just simple done right ! will most def be back. service was prompt and please get the rumchata, ask for an extra shot though :)\n\n\n\n\n\nWell any place in PHX that serves mojitos wins points with me.  We ordered a range of tacos and they were ok..nothing spectacular.  We actually liked the appetizers better.   The ahi stack was my favorite part of the meal..if I go back I'll probably just get that an a salad.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I had the Carne Asada Taco again.  Very good.  The cheese y mas was absolutely yummy.  The chips were on the burned side and hard, mixed in with a fresh batch.  We asked the staff and the whole batch was that way.  :(  I feel at that point, they should have made a fresh batch and not mixed the bad batch in them.  I got a watermelon Margareta.   If you like Solbe Life water w/tequila, you would like this drink. ;)  very light tasting.  I will give them a third\n try because some of this was very pleasant and yummy and I am hoping it was an off day.....plus the staff is really awesome.\n\n\n\n\nI had a Carne Asada Taco and had them add cheese. They forgot that and I had to send it back. :(   It was a good taco.   My friend had the chicken enchilada with 2 different sauces.  I took a bite and I liked the green sauce better.  They were both delicious but it was just preference. \n\nI had so many people coming to my table, it was confusing who my actual \"waitress\" was.  I just grabbed the nearest staff member when I needed something.  They have a nice happy hour but the drinks were on the weak side.  I would like that for my drinks, lol but my friend did not.  Again, that would be preferences.  ;)  \n\nThe ambience is casual and friendly.  I liked the staff.  I would definitely go again.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply put the food here is awful. Way too salty, expensive, and a tourist trap. The tacos were just shy of $4 each...that is outrageous for an extremely pedestrian taco that is neither good nor authentic. I didn't care for the rice or beans either. This is more of a happy hour/drink friendly place. YMMV.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tacos are AWESOME! I have been a few times and have never been disappointed with the food. Super yummy. Only bummed about the wait time. They don't take reservations so if you go on the weekend or during a busy time- be prepared to wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid choice for tacos, burrito bowls and margaritas, especially at happy hour! All margaritas are on happy hour pricing until 6pm, so you can swing through after work and have something super tasty.  Love the original house version and the blood orange.  Its tricky to order vegan, due to the magic sauce and their beans and rice aren't all dairy or meat free. Be sure to ask.  I did get a veggie burrito bowl recently and they subbed out the rice (made with butter) for quinoa.  It was really good.  My friend tried it and liked it better than all three of the traditional meat tacos she had ordered.  =)  They have lots of space at the bar, in the restaurant, as well as the patio too, so wait times and minimal if any.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo honey and I wanted a lunch out one fine Sunday afternoon.. so, with our baby in tow, we hit this joint up.  Not busy, so we got seated promptly.. outdoor in their patio area with the great weather.\nOur server guy was great - very friendly, talkative, prompt and gave good recommendations.  I had the spiked Horchata (with Frangelico) and hubby had on-tap beer.\nHis three tacos came out and, unfortunately, I didnt' get a chance to taste them but he appeared to enjoy them as I didn't hear a word otherwise.  My dish, the cochinito pibil torta was SOOO GOOD... that pineapple slaw was a perfect accompaniment and they *perfectly* buttered and toasted the soft, yummy torta the way I would!\nI thoroughly enjoyed that torta and really really liked the horchata.. grainy the way real home-made horchata is.\nI'd definitely come back, though not that regularly as it is a bit pricey for regular eating out for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place. They keep it simple and that totally works. Great selection of tacos and the  Blood orange marg with salt is most excellent!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere, kind of hip and eclectic. Good selection of good food and drinks.  Great service.  Nice location in the heart of old town Gilbert. Went with the 3 taco plate where you get 3 different types of tacos. Did not disappoint.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I have been trying to try all the cool new food joints in downtown Gilbert. Today it was Joyride Taco house. It was a weekday, so less of a crowd, always a good thing. Our server \"Floyd\" seated us quickly. we told her this was our first time here and she told us about how everything is Fresh,  home made . To start they bring out this crazy great salsa, I was blown away by its unique flavor. It was with a hint of sweet, citrus, spice, chunky, which equalled a explosion of awesome flavors!!! We had the lunch special. We each picked three tacos with a free side. The crispy fish taco is insane! The grilled fish taco a close second. The braised beef is good, but the fish is my favorite. My wife too loved the crispy fish and really loved \"The standard\" chicken taco.The Tacos are not big, but three of them was enough. Me and my wife shared a bowl of Tortilla soup, fresh, and soooo good. We will be back for sure, got to try other things, but it will be hard not to order the fish tacos again. Thanks to our very nice and helpful server, she made our visit even nicer!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Joyride for dinner last night to give it a shot for the first time. They have a simple menu but pricey for Mexican food; they will nickel and dime you to death on sides that you would ordinarily get with your meal at other Mexican food restaurants, so make sure you ask before you get your bill. My $12 burrito was nothing to write home about and the \"refills\" for their aguas frescas (no alcohol) are not free (it would be nice to know ahead of time). What you are really paying for is the ambiance, the dcor, loud music, their indoor outdoor concept and their cool hip staff which provide good service. I felt fleeced when we received our bill for almost $50 for 3 tacos a burrito, churros and our $10 agua fresca.  In my humble opinion, if you still care about the food and want great value for your hard earned money Nando's Caf is still a hidden gem in Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came here after watching a play at the Hale theater. First we started off with margaritas and I ordered the Blood Orange....omg it was tasty. They don't short you on the tequila either. I ordered the standard taco, carne adobada and the shrimp tacos. I have to say they were all amazing but my favorite was the carne adobada! I would definitely return. Very nice outdoor seating too!\n\n\n\n\n\nGo on Taco Tuesday for $2 tacos. The meat is always tender and the tacos flavorful. My ultimate favorite though, is their market veggies. Y'all need to order a side of their market veggies - it's not what you'd typically find at your usual restaurant. The veggies are slightly spicy, flavorful, and are melt in your mouth delicious. The market veggies change daily, so come in with an open mind!\n\nThis is my favorite taco shop in Gilbert. You really can't go wrong. True to their name, this place is an absolute joy to go to. \n\nAlso, they have a great happy hour (2-6 pm)!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis used to be my favorite taco place in the whole valley. Still has great flavor but they have dropped the quality of their Carne Asada. Last tacos I got chewed like bubblegum. No joke. Last three trips. They need to switch back to their old meat supplier, or  whatever they were doing different.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the tacos at Joyride! The salsa is amazing too! Great atmosphere with great food! Highly recommend!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was in town visiting my sister and wanted to try this place out. We went at lunch time on a Saturday and the wait was short. We were seated outside which was nice because it wasn't too hot. We ordered fish tacos, shrimp tacos, a side of rice, and chilaquiles (with egg whites instead of sunny side up eggs). The food was delicious and was freshly made. The tortillas were homemade which I liked. The food was reasonably priced and the portions were a good size. I will definitely be back next time I am in town.\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos were awesome had the standard and the fish tacos. Make sure you try the Mexican street corn!  Our server Tony was wonderful and on point.  Great afternoon happy hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter having walked past Joyride so many times and wanting to stop in, I was really hoping to love it.  Unfortunately, they fell a bit short.  We ordered various street tacos and they were okay but not really memorable.  Our daughter ordered cheese enchiladas and the cheese inside was completely burnt.  She really couldn't eat them.  The margaritas were pretty good and for a good price at happy hour.  With so many options now in DT Gilbert, I'm not sure if I'd return; however, you should give them a try if you're in the mood for tacos and margaritas.  The service was great and the atmosphere is really inviting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place has a really cool atmosphere! Service is good. I got the standard tacos and they were absolutely amazing. I like it because it's very unique and they even tie that in with their menu. Not a typical Mexican restaurant but I definitely love it. Will definitely be coming back!\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere is hip. Service is very good. Music a little loud. We each had a crispy fish taco. Notice I said taco... not tacos. We expected a little more food based on the price. The tacos here are pretty small. The taco was good but too watery (don't know what that juice was dripping all over my plate). Chips are ok, salsa ok. When I compare what I get from the popular local fast food fish taco place and other Mexican restaurants I have to wonder if this business plan will work.\n\nQuality is ok. Too expensive for what you get. I don't mind spending the money if I feel I am getting my money's worth. Don't know if we will go back or not... probably not.\n\n\n\n\n\nTook my Daughter-in-law out for lunch, we both had passed this place and were curious about it. Stopped in. Will for sure go back. Food was great, we tried a few different tacos. We were unable to try and fru-fru drinks as we had an appointment to go to after, but saw quite a few come out of the bar.  \n\nWe sat outside, a very nice patio behind the building, helps you not hear the street traffic. They have a section w/ real grass, we saw a few customers w/ dogs show up. that was ok as the dogs were kept on leashes. \n\nWe ordered 2 tacos each to start. received the chips and salsa... and couldn't stop eating them!! we finished the basket before our tacos came, and they brought another one. we ate them too. Our tacos arrived. based on the price, I felt they were a bit small, but they were very good. Fresh ingredients, that's for sure.\n\nWe both ordered two more tacos (and more chips and salsa) and enjoyed them.\n\nOur server was friendly, a bit busy as it seemed he may have been the only one and the place was packed. But not a problem, it was a nice relaxing time. \n\nHowever, as we sat outside and the sun moved, we went from in the shade to in the full sun. they need a few more umbrellas, as the 3 they had were being used by those on the grass. speaking of those on the grass, a group of about 10 showed up and sat in the lawn chairs on the grass, enjoying each others company and a few drinks. Nice idea!  \n\nDidn't go inside, so can't review on that. For sure we will go back. When we stood up to leave, the manager came over and asked us how it was. We told him great, as it was, and that we wish we had ordered 3 tacos to start off instead of 2. he suggested that if we like a certain type of taco, and are very hungry, order the burrito, it's much larger, and costs less than 3 tacos. will try that next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging for salsa refills is ridicules. They give you a very small amount with chips and don't tell you to use it sparingly because no more salsa for you a unless you pay extra. It's Mexican food for crying out loud and you need salsa. Rip off and I will not go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nYummy food ! The enchiladas are the best that I have had . Margaritas are good but a little pricey. \nThe patio is awesome, spacious and cool, funky decor.\nService is good, nothing to write home about.\nGo for the enchilada and margaritas for sure!\nGood chips and guacamole also\nOne of downtown Gilbert's best choices!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past I've been impressed with this business - not anymore.  Waiter argumentative.  The stack of appetizer plates appeared clean, but were covered in grease and previous food - the fresh napkin with fork was also dirty because of the unclean plate.  We were a party of four, but only received one bowl of chip pieces (some unbroken chips on top were covering the pieces).  When asked for another bowl, we were told there was a charge! We noticed that tables of two received the same sized bowl. As far as we know no manager was present.  Food was good, however, but in today's newspaper this business was shown as having several health violations.  We can understand why.  Oh, and we saw a waitress placing fruit pieces in drinks with her bare hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had really high hopes for this place. The service was super slow and took quite a while to get our food and it wasn't that busy. \n\nI had the carne asada, Baja and crispy fish taco. The crispy fish taco was actually pretty good, but the other two just didn't taste good at all. They pretty much lacked flavor and had no substance. The tortilla was also pretty bland. I can't really recommend coming here if your a big taco fan.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaco Tuesday, Taco Thursday, Taco Saturday...it's a lifestyle, not a day of the week! And Joyride is the perfect place to live out your taco dreams, especially during their 2-6 pm weekday happy hours! $2 tacos and $5 margs - how could you go wrong? \n\nThe Gilbert location was fun and trendy, and there was zero wait at 4:45 on a Thursday. We sat outside on the shaded patio, and it was gorgeous! Service was prompt and polite, and our tacos were delicious. Will be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nCute, trendy new place. The food was so-so. The nachos were good and plentiful but the tacos were flavorless. There was a lot of ice in the drinks making the bill more expensive than it should be. The service was so-so - in fact it was slow and not so great at all. But it's really, really cute. I love the environment and would go there again for the nachos.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard taco was my favorite. They have great specials for taco tuesday and everything was very quick. We saw the restaurant really picked up after 5pm so get the\nre early or there will be a wait for a table. \n\nI am surprised at how responsive the restaurant is and am very pleased to see that management reached out regarding my concern from my last visit. We are very happy and would gladly come back to this level of service.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoping to beat the rush we were excited about finally getting try this joint. Walked in and even though there was a table open inside, there was a 30 minute wait. Sat out on the patio. Water came and service was good but very slow. Noticed that a whole row of misters were turned off and others were  clogged. Why have them if you dont maintain them. As we sat there in the heat, we noticed three more tables get cleaned a readied inside. This was about 10 minutes now. I asked the hostess if we could move and all I got was she would put us back on the list. Not at the top, just back on. Speaking to the manager was like talking to a paper bag. No apology or answers. Just a head nod. As our beverages arrived, we got up and left. Good food doesn't make a good restaurant. It is the whole package. Be Better JoyRide.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to this restaurant with high hopes--everything else in downtown Gilbert has been good so we expected the same. We showed up and waited for 15 minutes and realized nobody else was waiting. I asked for our status in line and we had been deleted. I wasn't too concerned, they added us back to the list and sat us quickly.\n\nOnce we got a table the fun began. We sat for another 15 minutes waiting for someone to come to the table (for context, it was a Thursday not Fri-Sat). I eventually had to wave someone down to get help. We finally got our orders taken, a few beers, shrimp ceviche, some burritos and tacos. First came the ceviche and complementary chips with salsa--before the beers--and it tasted like they took frozen cocktail shrimp and tossed it with marinara; the chips and salsa weren't too bad. I think we got our beers halfway through eating our appetizers however we didn't receive any other help until we were essentially beer-less, chips and shrimp consumed. We were sitting there twiddling our thumbs for another solid 10-20 minutes. \n\nFinally, our entrees arrived. This is where they get the stars because everything else was awful. I had the beast burrito which was good and someone with me had the chicken tacos that they also enjoyed. But, of course, we had to wait another 10-20 minutes for someone to come ask for more drinks/check/assistance. We sat there patiently with empty plates till I finally had to wave someone down, AGAIN.\n\nIn total, I believe our waiter came to our table a total of 2 times over an hour +, everyone else would come by and drop off our stuff without making eye contact or saying a word--maybe they could sense my frustration.\n\nIt seems like everyone who works in there is a young teenager which most likely contributes to their awful service--just not enough experience. If I was rating based on food alone it would have been a 3.5-4 but we just couldn't get over how awful the service was.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation right in downtown Gilbert is great.  Layout with indoor/outdoor patio is great.  Stick with the taco's.  Nachos are SOGGY (i've had them twice...because i was hoping the first time was a mistake.)  I would encourage Joyride to review the \"recipe\" on the nachos and come up with a way to keep the chips crisp.  Hours are great as it is one of the only spots open late in Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent for the first time today after constantly driving by.  First impression was that it was too dark, I had to shine my phone onto the menu to be able to read it.  Then the real issues started with the service being the biggest one.  Took a good twenty minutes to order and then an eternity to get my tacos.  They were okay, nothing great though.  Server came by one to all if o wanted a refill however never brought it out.  Between the mediocre food and terrible service I don't think I'll go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food and drinks.  Great atmosphere.  The best chilaquiles I have found in the area!  The street tacos and fish taco are very good, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrendy can always cloud our senses.  A cute place, WAY too loud music!! I want to eat NOT dance!!! (At the moment). We were celebrating a birthday and we were seated by the front door so the ambiance was looking at Gilbert Rd.  The menu was simple and the food overpriced and underwhelming for tacos...I had a burrito which came out burned....it was extremely tiny for $8.  It was black, plunked on a plate, with no other friends, embellishments or garnish,  except an itty-bitty cup for a tablespoon of sauce.  Honestly how much does a thimble of beans, rice or salad cost!???\n\n I sent it back and they graciously and profusely apoligized,the manager even came by and apoligized and brought me an unburned version of the same, tiny, burrito.   My friends had three tacos that looked ok.  Since I'm from California,  the Mexican, or trendy Mexican food in Arizona , is substandard to say the least and not even close to what I'm used to.  Mexican food is not expensive...\n\nThe manager took the burrito off the bill but with tacos, burrito and non-alcoholic drinks $48 with tip.  Plus, no  treat for the birthday girl and the desserts did not sound appetizing..\n\nI will never return,  It didn't WOW me...there are bigger and better out there , without the hype, the trend, the crowded location and full parking lots on a Wednedsay night !  It's no big deal!\n\nI realize this is a bar atmosphere but I'm beginning to be extra picky about a little bit food for high prices....and the quality better rock, to justify those prices...\n\n\n\n\n\nCold tacos, watered down drinks.  Not a single Mexican person in this place.  Service was decent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent today for an early lunch. We enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed almost all of our food. The reason I gave them five stars is because when one of the servers picked up our dishes she noticed we hadn't eaten the soup. She asked if we enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup and I told her it was too chili based which I am not a fan of. What I didn't expect was for them to remove it from our check. That was a big suprise and unexpected. Great customer service, so lets take a step back and talk about the food. We ordered their lunch special which allowed us to order two tacos each and either soup or a half of their salads (3 interesting ones to choose from). I ordered the baja fish and the ahi tuni with a half salad. My husband ordered the standard chicken and the braised beef taco with the chicken tortilla soup at $9.95. As we waited we enjoyed their homemade chips and salsa that had a little kick (yummy). I also ordered a yummy virgin aqua fresca (pineapple). The only disappointment was no free refills on the aqua fresca (but it was to be expected as they will also make them with alcohol). The salad had papaya in it and was a bit overdressed but thank goodness for a light tasting vinagrette. Overall, we will defintely be back. We also left feeling it was the right proportion of food. Joyride is on the other side of Postino's and also to the left of Oregano's. so many places to choose from in Gilbert but when in the mood for tacos I definitely recoomend Joyride.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here with some girlfriends for a girls night out and our service was impeccable.  The menu is pretty small and I am a very picky eater, so I did have a bit of a hard time choosing something (which is why I am only giving it 3 stars), but I ended up with a cheese quesadilla and it was very good.  All in all it was a nice place with great service.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere, amazing food, tasty drinks, and salsa that was to die for! I had the taco trio and was very impressed, chicken, pork, and grilled fish were all fantastic. The blood orange margarita was mouth watering and at $5 (even on a Saturday afternoon) it was a steal. Our server, Fransisco, was very knowledgable and got us very excited for the food. I enjoyed the large selection of tasty yet dairy free options - as a dairy free individual I find it hard to find a good variety of Mexican food that still tastes good without the cheese. But now I have since they use house made aioli in their yummy sauces! Can't wait to go back and try more heavenly creations!\n\n\n\n\n\nGave it two tries with a few months in between. You're all on your own.\n\nFYI, the extra STAR is for great service.\n\nHere's the latest:  I took the afternoon off. Darcie and I were strolling DT Gilbert and decided to stop in Joyride. My drink was refreshing. My wife, Darcie, beautiful company. The service was exceptional, no complaints there at all. The food however, lacking, dry and unappealing. This is a Style over Substance establishment. There's a market for that. If you like trendy over tasty this is your place. For me, I'm always surprised places like this survive more than a 12 or 18 months.\n\nIf you have seen my other reviews, you know I invest some time to represent the experience.\n\nJoyride does not warrant that investment from me. Just not my place. Wish it was, but no.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe street tacos are WAY overpriced and mediocre at best. Their cucumber mint Aqua Fresca is delicious but I felt like every single item on the menu was overpriced for the flavor and portion size of what you receive. Their cocktails are very good but again, their tacos are lacking. Their crispy fish taco tasted very bland and almost like fried cardboard. We might come back for a cocktail but definitely not for food.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely witnessed under age serving of alcohol. Overrun with under 20 somethings ordering cheap tacos. Hostess seated her high school friends who showed up thirty minutes after us and we waited. Will never come here. Awful experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is awesome! Trendy, fun, yet laid back atmosphere. Once the weather cools a bit the patio will be a nice place to kick back and chill out. The food is full of flavor. If you like spice, they have it. If you like sweet, they have that too. My FAV drunk is the mint cucumber with vodka. The almond horchatta(sp?) Is awesome as well! I think they have about five or so Salas to try, I tried all the spicey ones; amazing! So far in my two visits I've had the fish taco, scallop taco, and carne asada taco.....yummy! All of them. If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll see how picky I am. If it's not healthy, I won't eat it. I have diet restrictions; celiac, and dairy. They were super cool with accommodating my diet. The bartenders and servers are top notch. I have to ask what's in everything....they all seem to know the ingredients like the back of their hand. Cool place, esp for Gilbert! Check it out...\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this place got 3 stars because they do have great food but I was very disappointed with some of the wait staff. When we first got there you had to literally flag down the waitress . She wouldn't come check on us and we had to keep flagging her down. Luckily her shift ended and we got an awesome waitress and great cute waiters. I hope to go back again and have better service. Btw the nachos are amazing! Love the carne asada taco. The original margarita (with better liquor)on the rocks is good too but way overpriced $11!  I think way too much for how little you get but its pretty strong so that's a plus I guess lol chips n salsa is pretty good too  sign up for their email thingy you'll receive a free appetizer and luckily for me the nachos are considered a appetizer. Whoohoo! Luv freebies\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered the Garden Variety Burrito and it was fantastic.  They are cool about leaving things out of the dishes if you have allergies, etc.  I appreciate that.  The vibe is great and everyone is very friendly.  We're thrilled to have it so close by.  Go Gilbert!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went here on a Friday night at 5:45 so as expected we waited about 45 min to be seated.  In the meantime there were people bringing around chips and drinks so you could have something while you waited. There was lots of outdoor seating  (Adirondack style chairs with little tables) to hang out in while you waited and enjoyed your refreshments. They also have misters going to ward off some of the heat. Once seated service was a bit slow but once we had our order taken the food was out amazingly fast. I had carne asada tacos, no cilantro (always a test to see if they can handle specialty orders) and my husband had the beast. Both were very good. The salsa is a bit too hot for me and it came on my tacos so I drank a ton of coke.  My husband loved it,  he tends to like really spicy things.  Definitely a hipster staff but not so much that you feel out of place. Lots of families, older couples and young couples there on dates.  Decor is very nice also.  It is kind of loud,  I'm sensitive to that because my grandma has hearing aids, I would never be able to take her there unless we sat outside. Overall great place and we will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've always wondered why the empty space next to Postinos East wasn't occupied by something and now finally I got my wish.  From the \"Owners\" of Postinos,  the Upwards Project, have rolled out another concept restaurant/bar.  This time its a taco shop. I love everything from the UP especially Postinos and I love Mexican food so I was very excited for this new place.  How can go wrong right?  \n\nThe Good\n-You can expect the attentative service you've expected from Postinos with LOTS of servers always checking up on you.  And of course all the servers are attractive and easy on the eyes.  \n-The dcor is always interesting, a mix between modern, with southwest, but more Texas southwest as opposed to Mexican southwest.  But never the less its also easy on the eyes. \n-The food is FRESSSSH and taste like everything is made from scratch.  After eating a few tacos you don't get that greasy, heavy, guilty feeling as you would elsewhere.  It seems like every item on the menu was created individually with its own recipe and taste.  No 2 tacos taste the same so you'll definitely have to try them all out.\n-The seafood is def the highlight of the place.  Esp the scallop.  Scallop ceviche is good and the scallop taco is fab.  The fish tacos are great too, especially the battered crispy one.\n-Ok so I lied, the drinks are the highlight of the place.  They have a good sized list of specialty drinks that they created themselves.  But not so long that its intimidating (that's what she said).  I like that its just not a Mexican restaurant and their only drinks are margaritas. They have a really good variety and they all taste good.  The drinks would be the only reason to come back\n-They have a nice chill \"patio\"/outdoor that you can go and just hangout and drink on\n\nThe Bad\n-Although every taco has it individual taste, that doesn't mean each taste is good. there are some taste and combinations that really just make you wonder.  Esp the chicken tacos.  \n-although the seafood tacos are great, the regular meat is just ok.  I've been all around AZ eating all types of Mexican food and i'd like to consider myself an expert of tasting tasty tacos and Joyride's non-seafood tacos are deff a lackluster.  They just don't have the same taste, the flavor, the 'OOOOOMMMPH\" as others. The carne asada, the chicken, and the pork (carnitas)\n-They have 6 different salsas, however only one of them is hot/spicy.  However the Spicy gradient is steep, we're talking tomato sauce to \"melt your face off\".  But no in betweens\n-The music is def like that of a bar.  American 80s,90s and some contemp rock.  Isnt this a taco shop, atleast some Mexican music, you can even do Spanish rock. \n-The ambiance is LOUD, like El Hefe loud but with more hipsters and less Dbags. If you want to have a quiet conversation, def sit outside or go next door to postinos\n\nThe Ugly\n-Everything here is expensive. $4 is the average price of ONE taco. Yes one taco.  The scallop is MKT price so you don't know what it is.  Although they are big and thoughtfully made. $4 is much. \n-They charge extra for salsa.  EXTRA FOR SALSA WHAT?  most Mexican places have a Salsa bar that you can choose from for FREE.  Its $2 for a small bowl of salsa.  \n\nPros:\n-Great seafood tacos\n-GREAT drinks specialties\n-great atmosphere\n\nCon\n-very Americanize that its barely Mexican\n-EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE. $4 per taco, $2 for salsa, $12 for ceviche\n-loud and borderline El Hefe like....(shudders)\n\nI would def come here to grab drinks and chill out on the patio but that's about it...\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not come here on Taco Tuesday(dinner) unless you've downloaded the app and put your name in ahead of time or you'll be waiting for a while! The service was understandably slow as it was extremely busy but food was good, not great just good.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter and 1.5 hour wait we got seated under a shedding tree. We ordered a burrito and a couple of tacos as well as guacamole. Guacamole was a little different than typical but very tasty. Enjoyed the chunks of avocado. My husband ate half his burrito and complained there was too much rice. That being said if was very tasty rice. Little light on the chicken. I had the Baja taco and a chicken one, both very tasty.  I would come back to the Joyride Taco House. I would not bring my son though as he would need to order too many items to feel satisfied.  Fun restaurant with great food!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an excellent place for a date night. My wife and I had a fabulous visit tonight. Food was great, little cool, but the server brought a heater close to our table.  So fun!!  Crispy fish tacos were excellent!\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowing that Joyride is owned by the same folks as Postino and Windsor, the flavors are exactly what you would expect - fresh, colorful and everything we tried had several layers of flavors. \n\nWe went for lunch and our server was great and quick. Beverages were always full and we tried several of his recommendations. I had a couple tacos and the cucumber orange salad, my friend had a burrito. All of the was great.\n\nThe salsa that comes right away is very flavorful and was well enjoyed. Only downside for us (just based on our preferences and sounds super picky) is that the chips are just too thick.\n\nAll in all, great spot for lunch and looking forward to trying more again soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place, it never disappoints! Perfect place to take the family or get together with friends! Yummy food!\n\n\n\n\n\nUp until last night I would have easily given Joyride 4 stars, however, after last nights dinner service (or lack thereof) I had to drop them down to 3 stars. Its unfortunate, because their food is absolutely delicious. My fiance and I have eaten at Joyride 3 times within the last month and the only thing that has stayed the same is the quality and taste of their food. The service seems to be very hit and miss. Our first experience was fantastic. Our waitress was kind and attentive. Our second visit was at the bar. The service was good, nothing outstanding like our first visit, but not bad. And then there was last night..... Talk about a catastrophe. Our waitress had little to no idea what she was doing. Multiple times throughout the night we were sure that we had been forgotten about. Our waitress took our dinner and drink order after we had been sitting ready and waiting to order  for over 15 minutes, it then took another 10 minutes to get our teas, and then she completely disappeared until it was time to pay. She never came back to check on us. When she presented us with the check, it was incorrect, so she had to go back and try it again. It took her another 15 minutes to come back with the correct check. Our dirty dishes and empty chip trays were never cleared off of the table, everything just sat there stacking up. The manager passed by our table several times, looked straight at us sitting there waiting with dirty dishes all around, and just kept walking.... \nAgain, the food is wonderful. We absolutely love the shrimp, braised beef, carne asada tacos, and chicken nachos but wow the service keeps going downhill with each visit. If the service continues to follow this same pattern I am terrified to see what it would be like if we decide to go back....\n\n\n\n\n\nI have heard great things about this place from friends and have seen a line out the door several times, but I wasn't impressed like I expected to be. The food was okay, but I don't see myself wanting to go back there again. It was super hot in there because of all of the glass, and our server only gave me refills when I asked. I also don't like how you have pay for any salsa refills when every other Mexican restaurant provides free unlimited chips and salsa. The salsa ran out really quickly especially if you have 4 people with you. I will say that the place was packed though, so maybe it's just me.\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLD! I am a devoted Joy Ride fan since Taco Tuesday last week! Love the menu, staff, and overall atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been a while since I've reviewed a good place to eat, so here comes the paragraphs..\n\nThird is a great spot in beautiful downtown Gilbert that is a go-to for some decent Mexican food and happy hour. I've been here several times in the past, it's a decently sized restaurant bar with outdoor seating.\n\nHappy hour is something like 2-5/6 on weekdays and gets you 5$ margaritas that are pretty tasty and strong, or a pitcher of beer for 5$, as well as 2$ tacos. \n\nThe tacos are okay, being the chef that I am I feel like they lack flavor, although the chips and salsa are on point... but try not to munch on them too fast because the severs inconsistently charge you 2$ for a refill.\n\nI enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant, although it was kind of confusing being served by two people who kept asking the same questions, and provided two bills. \n\n\n\nI have to be a critic and add that I've had better food like Nandos that is great overall,or similarly priced, but being that this place is located in such a cool area I would be inclined to return again soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the chips and salsa but wish you didn't have to pay for refills of it. Service can be slow waiting to get drinks but food always comes out fast once you place your order. Great atmosphere to enjoy drinks and/or friends. Take out is always good on busy nights too.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for the first time. Was actually pretty good. I like the flare and different flavor options and new ideas. The margaritas were amazing!! Only downfall is the place is really expensive. The margaritas were tiny too. Well the glass is huge but not much liquid in it! Overall good food but cant say Id visit often.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was making up for the fact we couldnt go Dos Los Molinos as they were closed on Sunday. I was blown away by the rockstar service provided to us by our waitress Breezy. She was amazing!! The food, however, was a complete surprise. It was fresh and flavorful and out of this world! Especially the blood orange Margarita, the charred habenero salsa, mexican corn ( heavens to betsy was it amazing) orange cucumber salad and the crispy fish taco which we couldn't get enough of so we ordered several more to go! This was a happy accident and I will be back for more.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really love the experience at Joyride! The atmosphere is very fun, the decor is colorful and trendy, and there is a lot of patio seating! I'm a huge fan of their drinks, especially those on the $5 happy hour menu, and their tacos are pretty delicious too!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a cumulative review of about a dozen different experiences I've had at Joyride.\n\nThe food is fantastic. The bartenders are talented. The customer service and management is awesome. In one particular instance, I screwed up my own order by not realizing it had beans on it. Totally my fault. Not only did the manager replace it, he didn't charge me for it either. These guys understand customer service and how to present an experience.\n\nI'd say my only criticism is not something I can really hold against them, they've very popular so there can be quite a wait sometimes during peak times. We try to visit at off-peak times. But again, I can't begrudge them for their own success, so I'll still give them five stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride was recommended to us by a friend. The wife and I went there last week and I haven't been able to stop thinking and talking about it. The Staff is awesome! Chris is a great manager! he was very helpful and talked to us for awhile. The food is AMAZING! Best Tacos I have had in a LONG time. Tortillas are amazing and the meat is insane! I am getting hungry just talking about it. Fish Tacos are insane with the white magic sauce! I highly recommend this place for day drinking with the rollup doors and awesome dcor! For sure try the Almond Horchata with a spike of Vodka! I am going back again this week for sure! It is my new found Addiction!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat atmosphere, great drinks & great food. Will definitely be coming back! Tony was our bartender, he was super friendly & made my first experience at this place awesome! He deserves kudos! Try this place out!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot as great as we thought. We had to wait about an hour which is not a big deal when you think they are as great as the reviews say. Ordered drinks while we waited for a table. Didn't get the drinks until about 5-10 mins before our table was ready. We still weren't complaining we knew they were busy. Our server was too busy to serve us so someone else helped us. It took about 30 mins to get our order in and 30 mins until we received our food. The shrimp tacos we ordered were burned to the point where you had a lingering after taste of charcoal in your mouth. They gave us another taco for free but the food was not as good as reviews made it sound. Maybe it was not a good night for them but we waited forever to get food that a hole in the wall place could have served in a fraction of the time. The staff was very friendly but the food was not good in my opinion. Very unlikely I will go there again.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting from CA and our host took us here. I had the the three taco plate with chicken tinga, short rib and conchita pibil. They were all delicious. The service was good and a manager touched our table and gave us a complimentary dessert. My only negative was the bomb beans were under seasoned. This did not ruin my experience however. Would recommend this place! Excellent!\n\n\n\n\n\nI hate to give such a negative rating because the service was good, atmosphere was good but this comes down to food and price. The tacos aren't terrible but they are nothing special and for the price definitely not worth it. Street tacos are very small and with a price tag of around $4 a taco, it's  hardly a bargain. I wouldn't be hung up on price if there was such a reason for that price, yet these tacos fall extremely short to dictate the price. I could go to an average authentic taco shop and get something just as good, if not better for $1.25. I feel as if whoever started this company thought they could reinvent the wheel yet the wheel is already amazing and a lot cheaper than their wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy ride never disappoints! Great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and great drinks! On Saturdays they are in happy hour during the lunch hour, and the five dollar frescas are a must (the cucumber mint is my favorite!) The service is always friendly and fast, and the waiting area is a beautiful patio. We all got the tacos and loved them! Highly recommend the crispy fish :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nService is great very clean environments food very good salsas are excellent.If I could give it a 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent team service even while waiting for a table outside. Overall on pricey side for what it is, music is loud, chips are on heavy side, carnitas and carna asada overpoweringly spicy hot for my taste. Other 4 at my table said 6 out of 10 overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen there a couple times now and a great experience both times.  Cool atmosphere, though it seems like the outside part of the property could be set up in a more useful way (looks nice but not too many chairs or tables.)  We ate at the bar both times and service was exceptional.  They were friendly and very attentive but not overly hovering/checking in like some places do.  The first time there they had an accidental corn on the cob appetizer they had an extra of and the bartender asked us if we wanted it.  I thought that was nice, since most places would chuck an extra rather than give it out for free.  They also had a pretty decent beer special.  Can't remember exactly what it was but something like $5 small pitcher during HH, and that was for good beer (Kiltlifter) not the cheap stuff.  Tacos were delicious, I liked the standard fried fish the best (I ordered a combo of three types.)\n\n\n\n\n\nSo glad that there is a great urban vibe with great food coming to the east valley.  This type of eating is a first of its kind, and if you love tacos and want to eat at one of THE COOLEST(meaning reddest, most hip, not referring to temperatures) places in the valley, then stop here. \n\n\nOh. The tacos are amazing as well. I can't remember what the waitress said, but I think it's owned by some famous chef. \n\nSpeaking of waitresses. You'll have multiple ones. They all just stop at your table and make sure you're taken care of. Awesome concept.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, you need to know that Friday and Saturday nights are busy so you need to be prepared for a wait. Also, the environment on these nights is festive and loud. Personally I don't think it's a good place for group events. \n\nThe quality of the food was high. The carne asada, salsas, house made tortillas etc. were all very tasty. \n\nWe were both impressed that when an error was made and someone took a special ordered item to the wrong table, thus causing a meal to be deliver late, they were obviously very concerned. We had 3 people come to the table to apologize and the manager (I believe) came by to tell us that they'd taken that item off our Bill (without us complaining or asking for it). That obvious concern and care for patrons goes a long way. \n\nThe food alone is worth coming here for. The obvious pride of ownership and care for customers makes them even more impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is adorable; great decor, great vibe. I like the outdoor seating area. But I think it's over-priced. My friend and I ordered tacos and guacamole. IMO the flavor just wasn't there. I hate to say it, but Barrio Queen is just up the street and it's bursting with flavor!\n\n\n\n\n\nNew in town and I heard great things about this place. Went here with the whole family and we had a nice time. Place was family friendly. My 6 year old daughter lived he complementary chips and salsa. The food was average, I had better, however our waitress was really good. She was attentive to our needs and the family had a good time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been going here for years and it seems the food quality is dropping off. The salsa is not what it used to be and the food is getting more expensive with more fillers. The Beast Burrito used to be $9.50 and FULL of the BEST carne asada. Now the burrito is packed full with Spanish rice one one side and charge $11.50. No thanks, I'll take my rice on the side. Sad day when a downtown idol takes the back seat. Won't be going back anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust enjoyed a pretty lovely dinner at the bar. We walked up and the wait for a table was 50 minutes, but the bar is first come first serve and we magically found two seats next to each other at 7:30 on a Saturday night. Kismet. \n\nThe bar is big and comfortable, a wrap-around that's probably big enough for 30 people. My only complaint is there wasn't a place for my purse, I would love a hook for it underneath the bar. Our server was attentive and we got a smaller pitcher (about 2.5 beers) of good beer for $7, which I thought was a pretty stellar deal.\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa came out hot and spicy. The salsa was good to me, I love cilantro and smoky heat and it delivered. I ordered three tacos, the standard, carnitas and tuna, and also got the refried beans. It was all delicious, from the tortilla to the toppings! My favorite was honestly the standard - it was the quintessential street taco. Delicious marinated chicken with smooth avocado and a great pico on top. \n\nI'd definitely recommend it, and we'll for sure be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was told to come here by a friend and had some pretty high expectations so I was pleasantly pleased but not overwhelmingly impressed. I ordered 3 tacos and the cucumber orange salad (if you order 3 tacos it comes with a side). I ordered 1 shrimp, 1 carne asada, and 1 pork adobada taco. I also ordered a $5 cucumber serrano margarita and 1 $5 spiked almond horchata :).  The margarita was not as refreshing as I imagined it would be, and the portion seemed a little small, but I really loved the horchata, which I spiked with vanilla vodka. The tacos were tasty, but I think I prefer the tacos at la santisima. The cucumber salad didn't taste very orange-y to me and I'm not sure why they are more expensive than the other sides. That said, I much prefer the service here and will be coming back to try more tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice addition to downtown Gilbert. The restaurant is small, but there's a nice outdoor seating area if you're willing to wait. Service varies from good to kind of slow, but I think the food speaks for itself as it's tasty and well made. I definitely recommend a (spiked!) agua fresca.The lolo grain salad is an excellent choice if you're trying to go meatless. I think there's better tacos in the valley, but they're solid and will fill you up for a decent price. Don't skip dessert! Get an order of churros and let your taste buds walk through fried cinnamon heaven.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday I tried Joyride Taco House for the first time. There was a lot of rave and talk about this place, so I have been wanting to try it. It is usually really crowded, so I never want to wait, but since today was Easter, there was no wait. I read a lot of reviews about the service not being good, but all of the staff, waiters and waitresses were nice to us. I got a carne asada taco and the standard taco. They were both pretty good, but I think the carne asada taco was better than the standard taco. The tacos were both $3.75, but on Tuesdays they are $2. You get complementary chips, salsa and water right away before you even have time to look at one thing on the menu. They were quick with that which I liked. The restaurant is pretty hipstery and cool. I like the feel. I would recommend this place to other people.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews I wasn't sure I wanted to visit this place until it settled down a bit.  That gave way to \"what the hell, let's give it a shot.\"  Girlfriend and I did the drive out to Gilbert, walked in, and grabbed a couple seats at the bar since there was a long wait for a table.  We both tend to grade places like this based on their fish and/or carnitas tacos.  I'm an equal opportunity omnivore (the scale tells me this), so my requirements are little less strict, but she's the ultimate snob when it comes to fish and carnitas tacos.  After getting drinks, chips, and salsa, we ordered crispy fish tacos.  They arrive, we dig in, and after a few bites she said they're some of the best she has had.  That's very high praise from someone who will knock off points for anything that isn't \"right.\" \n\nAfter finishing the fish tacos, we ordered an assortment of salsa and while the charred habanero salsa is listed as \"melt your face\" hot, it's not quite there but more than hot enough to make you work up a sweat.  Maybe that's just a warning for tourists. :)  The habanero, tomatillo, and chile de arbol salsas were all very good.  Next up:  carnitas tacos.  Like the fish tacos, they were exceptional.  A little drippy, but that's far better than some of the dried out excuses for carnitas you'd find at lesser taco joints.  \n\nSure, you can get the same (in name only) food at a taco shop down the road for half the price, but you also get half the quality.  The prices aren't out of line for what you get.  \n\nWe're probably going back tomorrow to try other menu items now that we have a baseline.  Yeah, it's that good.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason why I am giving only 3 stars is first of all, because every time I go there, we never know who our server is. Throughout our lunch, we have maybe 4 to 5 different persons checking on us, which leads to repeated questions. The second reason is because of the prices, they are a little overpriced, must be because it is Downtown Gilbert, $4.5 for a taco is a bit too much. \nHowever, the atmosphere and the decoration is very nice, really modern and lots of colors. They have a nice little patio. If you go for lunch, ask about their lunch special, $9.75 for 2 tacos and a side (or half a salad)!\n\n\n\n\n\nI really liked it here.  Nice atmosphere, friendly waiters, cute decor, The Clash playing on the loud speakers (a wee bit too loud for my liking), and best of all - prompt chips and salsa delivery (for those of us who are famished and just don't like to wait).  Indoor and outdoor seating - with the choice of 2 patios.\n\nChips were good - not burnt or too thick, house salsa was nice with a little smokey flavor and not too spicy for those who are spice-challenged.  I ordered a cucumber mint agua fresca which was really light and refreshing.  Also got the nachos with a little added corn.  The server was right when he told me, \"it's like a meal.\"  Totally filled me up and I definitely had a lot left over.  \n\nWill definitely be back to try different agua fresca flavors and their veggie tacos!\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly a popular taco/bar spot - it was busy! You can use the No Wait app to get in line before arrival.  Cool interior, large garage doors open to outdoor seating, bar area inside. I like the atmosphere created by dim lighting, but it was too dark to read the menu - had to break out the phone flashlight to read it.  Good menu - my party was pleased with everything ordered. I had two tacos - carnitas and crispy fish. Enjoyed both but favored the crispy fish.   The carnitas was a richer, heavier flavor. Crispy fish was lighter and fresher in spite of the fried fish. Also enjoyed by others at my table - chips n' salsa, beast burrito (chimi style), orange cucumber salad, bandit taco platter (favorite on the platter was the black beans and carnitas), Mexican street corn (another favorite). Will definitely be back my next visit to AZ.\n\n\n\n\n\nSalsa... Very flavorful, not the overly roasted or hot ( which I actually prefer) but oh so good.\nAnd the chips complimented the saIsa perfectly.\nWe split our lunch options and actually went with two of the servers recommendations.\nAdobada Pork Tacos -they were good in their own way but pale compared to the Crispy Fish Tacos.\nCrispy Fish Taco - all kinds of flavor happening here.  No need for salsa or any other topping. Not the slightest bit fishy either.  \nBeast Burrito, chili style with green sauce\nHigh Roller, Blood Orange Margarita\n\nOh heck, it was all so good.\nThe atmosphere is neat.\nThe place is busy.\nThe server was knowledgeable.\nGood food and tasty drinks.\nAnd I understand a sister company to Postino?\n\nIt's a go.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I first heard about Joyride Taco House, we decided that the next time we had a taste for fresh Mexican, we were making it our destination - which is what we did last night.\n\nWhen we walked in, we were seated right away. Iced water, chips & salsa were brought to our table immediately. We had a server and then some!  Throughout the night, all of the servers helped each another!! Every server that walked by our table either filled our water glasses, offered to get us a drink, picked up dishes, asked if there was anything we needed, etc.  At the sake of sounding like a cheesy cliche, the place ran like a well-oiled machine - but a personable, outgoing, happy well-oiled machine! I've never experienced anything like it, I was almost dumbfounded, but very pleased.  The way the servers - from bar staff to kitchen staff to floor staff - worked together, had a positive effect on the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. I would go back for that alone. But we were hungry and were anxious to try the food as well! \n\nNext in my review: The decor!  Retro! Bright and clean with very comfy chairs. The bathrooms are spacious, private and spotlessly clean. I laughed and told my boyfriend about not wanting to come back out into the restaurant because the ambiance of the bathroom made me want to stay in there and meditate. haha  \n\nBefore looking at the menu, we ordered drinks. I had a Classic Margarita, and after tasting a couple beers, my boyfriend had a small pitcher of beer. Their Happy Hour prices made us happy.  \n\nNow, the food! The food was excellent, but of course, we could only eat so much, so we'll have to come back until we've tried it all!  I had the Veggie & Goat Cheese Enchilada. It came covered half in a green salsa sauce and half in a brown (mole-type) sauce.  The fresh veggies inside the Enchilada were chopped into bite sized pieces, and tasted delicious. The brown sauce was very spicy/hot for my taste. A server offered some Crme frache to tone down the heat, which definitely helped. (I would suggest that the menu states that the brown sauce is hot OR that the server states the fact, offering the option for only the green sauce.)  I loved the Enchilada and next time will have it with just the green sauce. My boyfriend had beef tamales that came with rice and beans - and not a drop was left on his plate. Everything from the chips & salsa, to our entrs tasted fresh and delicious.\n\nFrom our first visit/experience, we were very impressed and will come back  to try other items on the menu - and/or Happy Hour appetizers and drinks at the bar. They do have an outdoor patio with misters, which we would be willing to try on summer nights.  \n\nGood job, Owner & Manger!  \n\nI wanted to leave this part out of the main review. If there is ONE thing I would offer as a possible change, it would  be this:  The servers are allowed casual dress, which I like, and adds to the casual, relaxed atmosphere of the place. I would only suggest that there be something that stands the servers apart from the customers - such as all black shirts  OR Hawaiian shirts OR something similar for the men - and maybe all black  or black & white attire for the women?    It really doesn't take long to figure out who the servers are - they are the ones who are constantly on the move and taking care of every customer in the place.  Keeping a casual dress style for the servers with some kind of consistent theme is only a suggestion.  We love Joyride Taco House and we will be back!\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nUpdate: CELIACS BEWARE: Although Joyride Taco House may have \"gluten free\" options, until they have a separate station for preparing and cooking gluten-free foods, all foods may be cross contaminated by gluten.\n\n\n\n\n\nThought overall it was an expensive meal for Mexican and have had better for sure.  The margaritas overall are average, but expensive at $9 a piece.  Better off with the pitchers of beer as those are cheaper.  Ordered the rockfish ceviche for an appetizer, which was nice and fresh tasting.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant before where chips and salsa were not free of charge.  Not at this place and would not pay extra for salsa.  Got the Beast burrito, which the meat was flavored well, but with no typical sides was kind of disappointing.  Too much hype for a new restaurant.  Think you are just paying for the ambience.  In my book, Mexican should not be an expensive experience.\n\nBy the way, I like how Yelp filtered this review even though it is real.  I've had this happen before when writing negative reviews for places.  No doubt I ate there yesterday at the restaurant!\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Mexican food in the east valley! We've taken several friends here, and they have all loved it. Awesome veggie tacos, Mexican corn on the cob, and super fresh margaritas! Great service and system they have to get people seated & fed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere is great, good music, friendly and very attentive staff. Our waitress was always right there to refill our drinks when they got low. Over all great customer service. I believe something I ate there was either bad or I had a reaction because the whole next day I was puking... However I can't fully blame them cus I ate other things that day too . Would try again\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's start with the good.....the chips and salsa. Now let's get into what went wrong. I ordered water and the glass came with lipstick on it....disgusting!!! Wash your cups and train your dishwasher to check them. Next....my fork was dirty..crusty food all over it. I asked for a new fork twice yet one never came to me so I had to share a fork with my spouse. The grilled fish taco had zero seasoning and was so dry I felt like I was eating jerky and the steak also was not seasoned. Salt and pepper can assist with this. We will definitely not be visiting this establishment again.\n\n\n\n\n\nCool atmosphere, great tacos just small portions for the price. Their home made tortillas are great and it's nice that they don't fall apart. Their spiked fresca drinks are good too.  Fun place for lunch or happy hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried this place with a friend while out to lunch today. The menu had many innovative dishes, they have taken your typical Mexican dish and spruced it up a bit. My friend ordered an enchilada plate that she raved about and I ordered a chicken taco and a cucumber and orange salad. I had never thought to combine those two but it was very refreshing. I will be going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nwe visited joyride in old town gilbert this weekend, and the food was outstanding,  and the service was great! very accommodating!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was my first time here and the wait was an hour on taco Tuesday around 8pm.. let me just say I would wait another hour for these delicious tacos!! So much flavor and so fresh! The warm chips with salsa were also amazing. I will be back!! Would have given 5 stars but our server didn't seem to like their job.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tacos were very good today. Perfect weather to have a great happy hour. The salsa was great to spicy for my wife, more for me to enjoy. I had a chicken tinga,and a couple carne asada tacos. My wife had the veggie tacos that were perfect.Good place to come for taco Tuesday.And the real bonus was we were able to do some Christmas shopping while dinning. Bought some gift cards\n\n\n\n\n\nPleasantly surprised by...everything. \n\nShort wait for a table of 6, drinks while we waited. I was impressed by the salsa, I think it had jicama(?) as did the guacamole. \n\nTried 2 different agua frescas (cucumber mint with gin & horchata with amaretto) both delicious & $5 on happy hour. The taco combo (3 tacos + 1 side) is a lot of food. Tried the shrimp, carne asada, and some chicken one...the shrimp was my favorite. \n\nI was very pleased by how clean and decorative the inside is, the staff is friendly, and of course delicious food. \n\nWill definitely come back. I'm craving a Mexican mule now...\n\n\n\n\n\nI was happy to see a new restaurant finally move into the space next to Postino, so when it opened, my wife and I had to try it. I have to say the service and drinks were great, but the food was quite a disappointment. The chicken burrito my wife ordered was filled with over grilled vegetables, very little chicken and wrapped in a tough flour tortilla. The only flavor detected was that of roasted corn. I was equally disappointed in the tacos I ordered. I tried both the shrimp and the chef special scallop. The corn tortillas were grilled until stiff and dry. The shrimp and scallop were plentiful, but again lacked any kind of flavor. If you want to try any salsa other than the bland house kind, it will cost you two dollars extra. Not worth the cost, when you consider you would have to eat it with the generic tortilla chips they serve. The one bright spot was the Mexican street corn. It was very good. Overall, I would say skip this trendy spot and go across the street for much better food at half the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun place with great ambiance, and friendly staff. But don't expect more than an average Margarita, and ok tacos. Everything is very overpriced for what you get IMO. The shrimp ceviche for 13 is about 1/4 the size of what you would get at a more authentic Mexican reataurant. I have been here a few times, and continue to go mostly because it is a fun plade to meet up with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went here on Friday afternoon with my friends after just landing in AZ from NY. We sat outside and braved the Arizona heat. Our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. A total plus was that it happened to be happy hour! $2 tacos and $5 pitchers. What's strange is that a pint of beer is $6 but $5 for a pitcher during happy hour, so I clearly had to go for the pitcher. I ordered the crispy fish tacos. The breading was delicious but I wasn't too keen on the fish used inside. Overall a great experience and I definitely recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nTacos are great. Street corn is great. Waiting a ridiculous amount of time while watching the waitstaff (understaffed) slowly saunter through the restaurant. Horrible. Paying for chip refills. Horrible. Still waiting.......\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly cow!  I had the veggie chimichanga..... it was incredible.  The rest of the group I went with orders a variety of tacos.  Every single thing I tried was really good.  The service was a little on the slow side, but that is probably because the place was packed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't come here on Tuesday's. My brother booked online so we could have a table inside and there must have been a mix up but they kept seating people wayyy before us even with our reservation and party of 3. Had to sit outside only to be pestered by the heat and FLIES. Couldn't even enjoy the food at that point. At least refill our chips too. Very upset because I rushed from work to enjoy their fish tacos and couldn't even do that. Overall we had a terrible experience at the Gilbert location compared to the Phoenix location.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaco Tuesday!! $2 tacos full of flavor! We ordered a Veggie, Carne Asada, Crispy Fish & Baja Fish - all awesome! Excellent service. Used app to check in & were seated quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust tried this over the weekend. Went with a friend of mine and our tacos were yummy! Loved the hip/trendy dcor. We each ordered three tacos to get the free side. I ordered the carne asadas and one Baja fish and a side of beans. She ordered one Baja, one chicken, and one shrimp and a side of orange cucumber salad. I loved my carne asada, the fish was fresh but I wish it was more tasty. She didn't like her chicken very much, liked the fish, but said the shrimp was the best. We both liked our sides - actually she loved her cucumber side! My side of beans was very generous and could have been split between both of us. Service was efficient, wish it was a little more friendly but can tell they wanted you in and out.\n\n\n\n\n\n((Maybe it was an off day))\nIt looked promising.\n1. The COFFEE tasted gross!\n2. Need to use purified water.\n3. Had eggs rancheros I think the Eggs we're bad! Along with the salsa! ((I got Sick later on that day))\nMy mom had Fish tacos she didn't finish them either the only things that were good was the quesadilla\n \n((But like I said could have been an off day!))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tried it, liked it but probably won't return. I found the margaritas sour, the blood orange one too sweet, the chips too thin, the experience fair. Loved the outdoor space and the service was excellent... thus the three stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tacos and the black beans here are delicious! they also have extended happy hour from 11-5pm which is fun for lunch!  really cool atmosphere and friendly wait staff!\n\n\n\n\n\nTried joyride a few times. The horchata and fried fish taco are awesome! We will definitely be back soon! We would also recommend any of the happy hour cocktails, hard to go wrong with any of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vibe is on point, however I wish I could say the same about the food. Very pricey for what you get. Food taste was fine, but I rather go somewhere else and eat. Not the best bang for your buck.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the fish tacos! Oober tasty! The cucumber salad is soo delicious... YUM! Just the right amount of sweet and spice!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Joyride Taco!  Their tacos and Mexican street corn are the bomb!!  Everything is delicious here!  I love their outdoor patio that's dog-friendly.   I've always gotten great service here, as well. Everything is very fresh.  We eat here often.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent tacos. Only one veggie option though. Margarita was yum as well. \nI give 4 stars because for a teeny tiny bowl guacamole they charged $8! \nGo on Tuesday, and don't order guacamole. It's totally worth the long wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nNice spot in old town, right on Main Street with nice outdoor seating.  Service was ok., place was busy and staff seemed hurried.  Food was mediocre., expected more flavor and richness but found it to be pretty basic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is just OK. Atmosphere is great, food is average. Better tacos across the street.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came for a friend's birthday lunch, her second time and my first. It was pretty crowded although it sounds like that's pretty typical for Joyride.\n\nWe had a 45 minute wait that went by quickly thanks to the fresh squeezed margaritas and craft beer. My favorite drink was the cucumber margatprita with serranos and green tea syrup. \n\nBut the star of the menu was the guacamole...and I am a picky guacamole consumer. It was freshly made with chunks of avocado, sprigs of cilantro, and a few diced jalapeos. We ordered two batches. I also enjoyed the neet, pomegranate, green leaf salad and my friends were gushing over their shrimp tacos.\n\nAll of these plus the fast, pleasant,and attentive service and attractive decor make Joyride a hit. We can't wait to come back on our next trip to the Valley; what an excellent addition to downtown Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for a date night with my husband. We sat on the patio. It was nice and the food was very good! We each ordered a bunch of the different tacos and also some sides of rice and beans. I had a margarita that was amazing! The service could have been better though - Our server only came by to check on us once and we had to wait for 5-10 mins when we were done eating for her to come with our bill. Not sure if that was because it was a busy Friday night. Overall a great experience though.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place... Food is always great, and the atmosphere is fun and casual. Come in between 2-5 if you can. They have $2 tacos and $5 pitchers. Great way to end the week!\n\nService is always friendly, and remains consistently good, even through the apparently high turnover of the staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place. Everything I've tried has been really good and decently priced. I love the atmosphere as well. Although I prefer the outdoor dining area more because the music is really loud indoors and difficult to have a conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat experience. Nice people start to finish and absolutely considerate. We simply wanted an appetizer and the nachos fit that desire and were amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery average. Kind of a hit and miss. One day it's pretty good, the next day things aren't seasoned right. Went on a Tuesday for taco Tuesday. 1.5 hr wait time. Walked around downtown Gilbert and they texted me when the table was ready, which was nice. (So we didn't have to wait at the door and lose our spot in line) Not all of the tacos on the list are $2. Well, the best ones on the list aren't $2. Lol. But if you get the $2 tacos they're pretty filling and it's a pretty good price, but not the best tacos in AZ for us taco enthusiasts. Still on the hunt!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent on a Saturday for an early dinner.  Service was great, waitress was friendly, we were seated right away.  We also moved tables because our location was too loud for me and they had no problem with that. Living in Phoenix, I feel like we have lots of great food options here and I would say that their food was a bit pricey and tasted good.  Not great, not awesome, just good and that is fine.  The chips and salsa were great (probably best part).  We also ordered the fish taco (husband said that was good) and the carne asada burrito (that was ok).  Also got the vanilla custard pudding for dessert (very interesting, not my fave).  So, I guess I was expecting awesome since lots of people have eaten there and suggested it to us, but I thought it was average.  I do love the ambiance, though and the outdoor seating area is great.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistently a favorite for its awesome food, relaxed and fun decor, great energy and fantastic service! I avoid the downtown area in general during peak times, but always sneak into Joyride midweek for an early dinner that never, ever disappoints!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is fantastic! Great place to take your friends. The music is on point playing trap/ real good hype stuff you can vibe to. \n\nThe staff will treat you right and get you set right away and if anything is wrong they will not hesitate to fix it immediately and we had multiple staff members constantly checking in and I appreciate the customer service!\n\nOur group went in late almost closing time and they took care of us as if it were any other time.\n\nThe Food is worth the trip as well -very delicious and well done, they have some pros cooking for them. A real gourmet taco that serves bomb a** carne asada (so my friend says-meets \"grandma\" standards)\nAnd they have vegetarian options that they also made vegan for me. They were very accommodating with options and substitutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome food and friendly staff.  We had the crispy fish tacos and  sweet  corn.  Could not have been better.  We will be back for happy hour.  Great atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent service and solid food, with local beers. Spiked cucumber aqua fresca was perfect for a sunny afternoon. Horchata fresca, not so much..strong artificial almond flavor.\n\nTheir salsa was wonderful, as were the nachos with chicken and the carne asada burrito bowl. The chips for the nachos could have been less soggy. I'd definitely go back for the pitchers of brews & probably try the tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was waiting to try this new spot so I finally did.\n\nAs you can tell, I'm not a fan.\n\nI'm not a hater nor a guy who has a bad experience and opens an account just to trash a place. So this is my opinion based on my visit:\n\nService: Pretty bad. It was like a bizarre play with two waiters who didn't know what the other was doing. Things like one bringing more salsa and the other asking if we wanted more salsa. Or one took off to the kitchen after taking the order and the other showing up asking if we were ready to order. Awkward. \n\nDecor: This is probable the only highlight of the place. Nice decor, different flare, pretty interesting artwork on the walls.\n\nAmbiance: The music was super loud, the light was extremely soft (flashlight recommended) and the music playing was hideous. But come on, everything starts with the name. Joyride? Really? AYFKM? What has that to do with a mexican restaurant? The wheels on the wall might give the feeling of a joyride to nowhere.\n\nFood: The only dish that barely approved was the beet salad (not that mexican, though). The cochinita taco uneventful (plus it's a huge pet peeve for me that restaurants use names to call dishes that have nothing to do with the real thing). Carne asada taco, meh, plus the tortilla was breaking and everything was falling apart. The street corn was a tragedy packed with butter. I tried the strawberry fresh water wich was actually pretty good although super sweet (maybe ordering one and water it down would be the right way to go). The almond horchata, same thing with the cochinita. They label something with a name that is so far away from the real thing that it doesn't make sense at all. The rice was also gooey and hard (not well done and it seems that they were stirring it while cooking)\n\nPrice: OMFG, are you kidding me now? 3.50 for a taco? And that's the less expensive one. Everything is super expensive specially for what you get.\n\nSorry to the team who brought this concept but there's a lot of work to do if they want to be there for the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot pleased at all by this place. We usually have a fairly large group when we go out on Thursdays, but service was horrible. It took almost 10 minutes just to get an iced tea. I was not impressed by the food for the price either. Furthermore, our server mixed up the cards for the split tabs and didn't even tell us about the mistake or even apologize. After talking to management they told me they were too busy to look into my issue and they would call me back when business died down, and never did. The only reason for more than one star on the review is because I called back again and the manager Sean looked into my issue and apologized on behalf of the rest of the staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, this place is good. If you have not been here, come. They have very good carne asada, and their food is full of flavor. If you want authentic Mexican food, do not come here. This is a great blend of authentic and modern. \n\nThis location had decent service, but it is laid backed and chill like the other location. I can never really understand this concept. I am not a fan of waiting for drinks to be refilled, or having to flag down waiters for service. \n\nAll in all, we enjoy Joyride once or twice a year. Worth trying out.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicious tacos!!! Gluten free options. Perfectly satisfying. The margaritas are incredible and only $5 on Tuesdays! We had the same waitress twice in a row, and she rocks! She brought out an extra margarita that they made and our night was made. 10/10 recommend. If only there were 10 stars. There was this one weird thing... a guy named John making duck noises. But at least he's cute. \n\nAlso, for sure order the street corn. No regrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favorite amerimex taco shop in town.  The chopped salads leave you wanting more.  The handcrafted drinks with fresh ingredients are out of this world.  The decor is colorful and lively and has a true hipster feel.  Happy hour is fantastic, but the place is busy all the time.  This is one of my top 5 Gilbert restaurants.  I keep going back to work my way through the menu and have not had a bad dish yet.  Try it!\n\n\n\n\n\nI would've given this restaurant 5 stars, but the service was awful. The food is terrific, but we waited forever to get anyone to take our food order. Our drinks were served quickly, but we waited a long time to place our food order and then waited even longer for the food to arrive.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat spot for a lunch or dinner date. I've had business meetings, beers, tacos,...whatever. the scenery is fantastic, close to a few other spots. The crowd is slightly sophisticated with zero pretentious fools. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family\n\n\n\n\n\nSO good! I loved the carnitas tacos and my prickly pear margarita! Super friendly staff and speedy service. It's a win!\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered take out for a late afternoon snack, a cup of chicken tortilla soup, and a damn good one at that! Looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu. That was a 5 Star cup of soup!\n\n\n\n\n\nTried out this restaurant the other night and it was amazing to be honest. My favorite food is tacos so im very picky when it comes to trying out new taco places. First of all it was great service, our waitress was very nice and welcoming. She was also very consistent and she recommended that I try the chicken tinga tacos so I ordered two of those and i also ordered 2 braised beef tacos and they were soo good! The food came out very fresh and the meat was nice and tender. Honestly, better than I expected! I will definitely be going back and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone craving delicious tacos! Btw the food isn't too pricey at all, but the drinks are!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is awesome!  From the food to the service to the music to the overall ambiance, it is amazing!  \n\nMake sure to try the street corn!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the tacos at Joyride Taco House. They are fantastic. I've been here multiple times and we happened to pop in on a Tuesday. $2 tacos. Yummy. \nI didn't see hard shell tacos on the menu. If you don't have them please add them so I can come here more often and bring my kids. For now it is my yummy lunch place.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been coming here for almost 2 years. Keeps going downhill on service. They now charge for chips and salsa. Sort of seems like a hipster spot as of recent. The taco Tuesday and 2pm specials seem to always change depending on what server you have. Think this is our last time coming here which sucks cause it was our lunch spot for a while. Referring to the Gilbert location. The last 6 visits have gotten worse and worse in service. There's a taco shop across the street we're going to try.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is good. But it is overpriced and the service is not very good. We had four different waiters, but I don't know which one of them was our actual waiter. We had to flag people down to get actual service. So there was always a long wait between asking for the check between getting the check between getting the check split and getting our change back and the change we got back was not correct. facility itself is fantastic very airy and breezy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTried this place tonight with my boo and  I am definitely a fan. He loved his carne asada burrito and my enchiladas were super tasty. They are a little different than the traditional saucy enchilada, but good flavor.  The rice was very good and the mexican slaw had pumpkin seeds in it, which added a nice crunch! The main thing that would keep us going back was the amazing service. Our server was Kimberly and she took care of us from start to finish. It is refreshing to go out and actually get great service.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat, innovative tacos! They're small so try all of them (but I recommend the chicken tinga, the standard, & carne asada to get started) The prickly pear margarita is the best! The service is great no matter if they're super slammed or not. They have a great happy hour!\n\n\n\n\n\nI order the chicken and beast burrito to go. Food is amazing but the service isn't. They forgot items in my order and when advising them of items missing nothing was done. They told me to come back after driving 30 mins there and 30 mins back. I prob won't be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame with with my girlfriend and our dogs, as there is a large dog-friendly patio.  I loved the location & look of this fun, festive, trendy lil spot. The music was great, lots of Dr. Dre, Snoop, & a whole bunch of other 1990's rap that made me feel like it was 1996 all over again.  \n\nNow, the food itself was not super impressive, but there were some items that really stood out.  Personally, I would suggest the chilled ahi-stack,  the cheese y mas, and the Mexican street corn.  As far as drinks, I would go with the frangelico horchata as opposed to a margarita. Pretty good service too.  I'll update review once I try a few more dinner dishes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was astoundingly attentive, seated immediately and drinks and chips to table within minutes. The braised tacos are fantastic! Will return often.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't understand the rave reviews. The food is moderately fresh, but the recipes are weird and the portions are tiny. I don't know if it's because I keep ordering the wrong things (tacos), but after 3 attempts here, my husband and I gave up. It seemed really gringo, and not not-Mexican-but-not-bad gringo like Chipotle, but not-Mexican-but-not-good gringo like Chile's, the chain restaurant. So if you feel like a hipster, expensive, Gilbert edition of On-The-Border because you've too scared to go to Mexico or even just Mesa so you don't know the difference, go for it. It reminded me of the time I went to Nogales and ate at place serving pizza - people get delighted at the idea that they're eating other people's food even when it has nothing even remotely to do with it. If you like decently fresh, authentic Mexican fare, I think you'll be more impressed with the patio than the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nUgh I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. My girlfriend and I have driven passed this place a few times and since she loves Mexican food and it was our anniversary, we decided to give it a try. Initial impression of the place was good, great music, nice atmosphere, we walked in with smiles. After a 5ish minute wait we were seated and received our complementary chips and salsa. Chips were good, salsa was meh. This is where the experience went downhill. To make it short, horrible horrible service, we probably read the entire menu 5 times before anyone showed up. Anyway, on to the food, we both ordered carne asada tacos and carnitas tacos. Let me say, I enjoyed the pork tacos, good flavor, nice and juicy, very good. The carne asada on the other hand tasted like I was eating a burnt charcoal piece of meat. Once our mediocre meal was complete, we decided to take a nap since we had plenty of time before our server checked up on us. After giving us our bill twice (really?) we finally paid and left. Ugh this location is close and we had high hopes but alas another restaurant bites the dust.\n\n\n\n\n\nCool place - great name!  I've been there a few times and had a great experience on both.  The service was very good the second time likely due to the manager? who gladly rolled up her sleeves and helped out with everything.  I spent more than a decade in the restaurant biz and I really like the way she runs the floor and talks with guests.  Yeah OK and she's cute too!  :)\n\nThe first time I just drank at the bar and service is always top notch with Chris who I have seen at a few other places in the valley.  He is a professional bartender for sure.\n\nI like the dcor and love the fact that they planted desert cactus and succulents outside rather than the typical landscape mix in AZ.  Nice job to the designer there.  The art and materials inside are also pretty cool.\n\nI'm tempted to drop a star because the food is a little pricey as mentioned in some of the other reviews and the chips and salsa are average and could use some work.  I'd also like to see more awareness of specials which we had to discover.  \n\nThe place is busy so be careful about showing up with a big party.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have lived in Phoenix for 30 + years, you would agree that Gilbert might not be worth a special trip for anything since you can get just about everything in Phoenix!  Well, HELLO GILBERT!  It has totally redone the downtown strip and it is lined with great restaurants like JOYRIDE.  My first time in there, TayK took such good care of me!  Great recommendations, suggestions for next time, and more.. She was totally passionate about her craft and it made me want to try everything on the menu.  I had tacos (of course) and the Corn... AMAZING.  Oh, and the blood orange margarita was absolutely perfect!  I will be going back for Taco Tuesday!!!  See you there!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went there for a couple's date and sat at a lovely table on the patio. It faced Gilbert Road, adjacent to Postinos and it was very loud. However, the music slightly drowned out the street sounds. The service overall was ok. Our waitress came around to check on us periodically but I understood as it was a busy Friday evening.  We were first served chips and salsa.  You could tell the chips were made fresh and the salsa was good not great. I ordered the cucumber mint tequila drink. So refreshing, but paying $8 for this it was a little weak. My friend got the almond horchata with frangelico. It was good  not too sweet, but I felt it didn't have enough horchata flavour. For an appetizer, we ordered the queso dip. I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Now on to the tacos...we were all very confused by what they meant by \"family style\". All it means is they come on taco trays not in any sort of order. You get one taco $3 to 4. The best at our table was the shrimp, braised beef, chicken tinga and Baja. We also had two sides...black beans (So very good, probably cooked with ham as they were very rich) and rice (didn't finish it as it was dry and slightly bland). Our table agreed we would come back perhaps during their happy hour,  which is from open to 5 everyday, as the bill racked up quickly from everything being al la carte. At the end of the dinner, we had a chance to meet the manager and he was delighted to know we found it because of yelp. So next time I have my eyes set on one of their tamales. Yum! We will see how that goes...\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a Carne Asada Taco and had them add cheese. They forgot that and I had to send it back. :(   It was a good taco.   My friend had the chicken enchilada with 2 different sauces.  I took a bite and I liked the green sauce better.  They were both delicious but it was just preference. \n\nI had so many people coming to my table, it was confusing who my actual \"waitress\" was.  I just grabbed the nearest staff member when I needed something.  They have a nice happy hour but the drinks were on the weak side.  I would like that for my drinks, lol but my friend did not.  Again, that would be preferences.  ;)  \n\nThe ambience is casual and friendly.  I liked the staff.  I would definitely go again.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I held our wedding rehearsal dinner here for 20 people, and we were beyond pleased with the booking experience, customer service, quality of food and overall experience. The food and drinks are delicious and the service is top-notch. Prices are very fair for the quality of food. The atmosphere is fun and festive. We ate on the back patio - it was perfect.  We will be back again for sure!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family loves Joyride's food. But the service is sometimes a little disappointing. \nToday we had the best visit we've had in a long time. The server (who I think is new) was great. My carne asada taco was the best I've ever had there. The bar is set high for our next visit, which will probably be soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell...my review is 100% based on service, as my husband and I did not order food just drinks, however Gabriel was so welcoming and made us want to come back for dinner. We frequently stroll downtown Gilbert,  but we usually visit Postinos or other restaurant's in The area. We had our dog with us today and we were looking for a dog friendly place to stop and have a drink or two. So glad we stoped here the service was far beyond excellent. We will definitely return. Every single staff member made us feel like we were part of the FAM! GREAT JOB!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy ride has great tacos and margaritas.  I had a carne asada taco, carnival taco, standard taco and crispy fish.  Each one was well built and the flavors melded nicely.  None of the meat was dry.  The service was great and the building its self was cool.  I would go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service is extremely hit or miss.\n\nThe first time my girlfriend and I went here our server was great - everyone else ... the other 4 people who brought us something or sat us... were bad.\n\nAt first we were going to brunch down the street, but they were on an extremely long wait. Then we walked past Postino's and decided to try something new.\n\nOur server was attentive, yet the chips and salsa were slow initially and for refills.\nThe food was delivered by what seemed like a manager and she did not ask if we needed anything else or offer to refill our empty waters.\n\nGreat beers on tap, the tacos are very good, and the servers make up a little bit for the overall way too laid back service. The decor is nice and the location is great, but get there early on the weekends or be prepared to wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get drinks on the lawn while you wait for your table at this family friendly location.  If you ask really nicely they might serve you appetizers there too if you just want a snack and some drinks.  The wait gets to be pretty long on Fridays and Saturdays, so you want to make a reservation if possible.  We had done happy hour before coming here so we ended up not being hungry enough to get any food - I'll have to try that next time.  I love the color scheme here - bright and happy.  Casual to casual-dressy - perfect for jeans and a cute top or a sun dress.  A bit hipster too.\n\nOur drinks were good - I don't remember the name of the one I had but it had lots of cucumber and was delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food here is great- the crispy fish tacos are awesome, as are all the other tacos we've tried. The meat is the farthest thing from dry and is super flavorful. The churros dessert is insanely delicious too!\n\nSide note- if you're not a cilantro fan (I'm not) just know that it's mixed in their pico and they can't really remove it. I had asked for no cilantro on my fish tacos and the bartender didn't know they couldn't remove it and I ended up having to scrape the pico off of the top, leaving me with a tortilla and a piece of fish (not really worth the $4.25 price tag!) the customer service was great though, the bartender was incredibly sincere and offered us a free dessert to make up for it. Would definitely come here again besides the cilantro aspect- we saw a table by us get some Mexican corn that looked super delicious!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bartop is hella beautiful and recognizable too. A shout out to Stephen & Loni Kfoury of CA Butcher Block. The majestic mahogany is outstanding. Your best one yet, that I have seen. \n\nOnward to the decor. What stands out is the wall art. The old car steering wheels are pretty cool tho I don't believe I saw a wielded chrome chain one, a must, but the 12 volt headlamps were awesome. I haven't seen old car lamps used since The Limelight, a nightclub in LA. I have always thought about car lamps as an accent lightning. Well done.\n\nJoyride is part of the Federal Pizza, Postino, Windsor, Churn owners that are branching into Mexican food. Tonight I started with a Victoria Beer $2.5 for a shorty. A Vienna Lager style beer brewed in Mexico City. A very drinkable, kinda lite beer. Next came chips and a green salsa. \n\nMy entree was veggie enchiladas with goat cheese, corn and green chili, salsa verde and guajillo sauce $9. Absolutely superb. I finished off with a lime, salt and a shot of Tequila Ocho Resposado $11.5. An excellent after dinner drink.\n\nLooking forward to Joyride2 in my hood. Thank you James for the outstanding service and looking forward to the \"Chefs Suprise\" at the 2. Great job everybody!\n\nBTW, love the Pandora Radio.\n\n\n\n\n\nEh, food was really expensive. It was okay food, the carne asada was good but still it was all a bit too pricey.  Short and sweet- service was garbage. Might have over looked the price but couldn't with the slow service. I did like the music though. Probably won't go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere = nice\nGreeter= superb\nService = horrible...never got a tea refill the whole hour we were there\nFood= 2 blocks of fat on plate. They did replace with meat. \nWill I return?  Probably not\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the street corn here. I usually just go here for the corn. Tacos are okay. The reason why I just gave 4 stars. The guy was super nice here! He felt the corn was too small so he gave me 2! Score!\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper deluxe, delicious taco centric fare with a modern healthy take and margaritas.  Waited outside for about thirty minutes on a busty Saturday night.  No problem, because the Host takes drink orders and there's ample seating to wait.  Busy night overall and a definite hot spot.  Service was great carried by a hosting staff that supports the floor with deliveries, drinks and table turns.  Awesome food. Tacos excellent. Cucumber Serrano Margarita, the bomb.  Can't believe our three year old slept through it all. Note: noise level due to busy dining room and bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I frequent Joy Ride.  The waits are often long for a table but we're usually lucky enough to find a spot at the bar.\n\nWe've never been disappointed with the food.  Most of the time, it's really good and occasionally, amazing.  The house cocktails, while not classic, are good in a spiked fruit juice kind of way.\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome.  Bustling but not overly loud.  When the weather is nice, the patio is a nice option.  The music is right in my wheelhouse.  \n\nPrices are fair and sometimes a bargain.  For instance, they do a 32 ounce pitcher of draft beer for somewhere around $7.  The beer selection, while not terribly craft-centric, has a few good choices, i.e. Dale's.\n\n\n\n\n\nate there twice now. . the tacos themselves are a bit bland, the fish taco was terrible but they replaced it which was great. Tortilla soup was very good. service was good.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen going here since they opened.  Really great tacos. My favorites are the shrimp and braised beef. Food is definitely 5 stars but giving it 4 stars because I really wish I had one server when we went. All the servers help out each other which is nice but never quite sure who to ask for something when we need it. Everyone is super friendly and fast. This is definitely a great place to bring family and friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is fun trendy and the servers are enthusiastic and energetic. The guacamole was good  and the waitress comped it for us.  The pink grapefruit mint aguafresca was the flavor of the day. It was good and refreshing. Cucumber one, not so good.Needed simple syrup and more straining. Horchata just okay.   \n I did not care for the type of fish they used for the crispy fish taco. Didn't seem mild enough.\n The chicken tinga was okay but I make it with more balanced spice and better texture in my slow cooker at home (its super easy) We got a couple of desserts and they were yummy! \n All in all, I can appreciate the taqueria which serves  aguas , homemade tortillas , and a good complement of desserts.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been here on several occasions and I've always enjoyed the experience. The outdoor area looks like it's current under construction, but if it remains pretty similar, it's an ideal place to hang out and catch up with friends. Inside is a little loud with music. I usually get the tacos but friends have always liked their food too. The churros and the agua frescas are amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nI expected to have a better experience. I ordered an Almond Orchata, there was no almonds in my orchata, there were pecans that's to start the second con is that it was loaded in cinnamon and I mean loaded, I love cinnamon but this was exagerated amount in my drink, it was hard to drink it. I ordered the chipotle chicken tamales, hmmm they weren't seasoned as I would expect, actually I did not find the chipotle in my chicken and the third comment is that we ordered the hot habanero salsa and it was not hot at all :( . The service was a little slow but I understand it was a crowded friday night, if the waitress would be a little more friendly I wouldn't mind that detail.\n\nThe place is nice to go out, the food not so good to my mexican palate, the drinks I would give them a second chance, perhaps.\n\n\n\n\n\nOhai.  Tacos are good but expensive and so are the fresca.  Try to make it to happy hour(no food just drinks) Use coupons when able. Kthxbai\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time there last week and it was amazing!! Ordered 3 tacos and the guac. BEST guacamole in town!! Definitely recommend and will go back. Service was great and manager Richard kept making sure we had a great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food was amazing, drinks (minus the one made incorrectly, promptly replaced) were fabulous. Wait staff was atrocious. It was a busy Saturday night and our water was not refilled once, we would've ordered more drinks had anyone stopped by our table or asked. After sitting staring at dirty dishes and empty glasses for 45 mins, watching both our waiter & waitress walk by without acknowledging us or so much as making eye contact, we flagged one of them down to ask for our check. I expect attentive, pleasant service and was completely underwhelmed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Joyride tonight with my wife.  Both of us needed a fix for churros with chocolate.  We were hoping for something similar to what we had in Madrid near Plaza Mayor and Calle Toledo about a year ago.  It was nowhere near that.  We still say what we had in Madrid was more to our liking.\n\nThe churros at Joyride in Gilbert were too sugary, and therefore too sweet\nThe churros were missing the cinnamon...only tasted the sugar\nThe chocolate was too sweet.\n\nOn our drive back home to Mesa, my wife and I discussed this, and said that what we had for churros at Joyride was nothing like like Madrid.  Perhaps if we want churros like what we had in Madrid, we shall have to return to Madrid.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to like this place more. The food was just ok. We all liked the guacamole but the tacos were nothing special and the rice that came with it was gross. How can a taco house have bad rice? \nThe location is great.\nOur server was friendly but not attentive and we ended up waiting a LONG while for our bill. I'll just sum it up and say we won't be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid bet for lunch or dinner in the Gilbert area. I live in Arcadia, but grew up in the East valley and have many friends who still live out on the east side. Since most of them have babies now, I am always looking for decent spots in the east valley to meet for lunch, etc. since it's easier for me to travel (no kids) than it is for them. \n\nJoyride is similar to several other iterations of the same sort of upscale Mexican/taco concept, like Sol or Barrio Queen. They have a nice deal where if you order three tacos they give you a free side, which rounds out the meal. \n\nI had the veggie, shrimp and ahi tacos (photo posted) and they were all good. I liked the shrimp and veggie the best, might switch out the ahi for a different option on the next visit. The prices were reasonable for this sort of restaurant  and my friend was pleased that they had decently priced kids menu. \n\nAll in all, we enjoyed our visit and I would certainly visit agin or hit up the Phoenix branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is such a WIERD vibe in here tonight . We waited 20minutes for our drinks after ordering them, while,   in the meantime three different people came over to take our food order!!  take our food order!!!! Can I take your food order?????  CAN WE GET OUR DRINKS FIRST? The girl with the bull ring in her nose, was just clueless. I reordered  a diet coke three times and when she brought me the last one, you'd think she would have taken away the  three REGULAR cokes that were piling up, nope, just left them there. Ughh! It's Not like anybody is really rude or mean, but there is no attention to detail or customer service.  The waiter, as precious as he thinks he is, is rushing by and throws down drinks without stopping, spills water all over the table as he refills the water glasses, giggling  it off as he saunters away, leaving us to wipe up the splattered water that is on the table and cell phones with our own napkins. Then he hounds us to order order order! Ready to order ready to order ready to order???????????????????we haven't  even gotten our appetizers yet. I thought the place was closing based on the urgency to order only to be told\nThey are open another 90 minutes. We are paying the bill for our appetizer and going over to Postino. Something is just to weird and it's making me a NERVOUS WRECK!\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved it. Just...loved it. Very hip vibe, very fun decor (can't go wrong with Lego Storm Trooper posters and hexagon tile walls), and the food...mmmm! The hubs didn't care for it too much, but he would prefer a big-ass burrito wrapped in foil to something with complex flavors and interesting ingredients. :) I love him, but he's not a foodie. I really enjoyed it--the tacos were fresh, brightly flavorful, and the meat was perfectly cooked. The house wine was great, too. Didn't taste cheap, and at $9 a glass, it better not be! The kids' menu was totally do-able for my picky 6 year old. She had a quesadilla with fruit salad and gobbled it up. We told her no churro for dessert if she didn't...that did it! \n\nDessert took 20-30 minutes to come out. Not sure what happened, but they noticed, and they comped the dessert, plus gave us a $10 voucher for next time--very classy move, and saved the experience. \n\nI'll be back, probably not with the husband, but with my friends who are more adventurous!\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptional service along with exceptional tacos what more is there to think about ?  I've been living in Gilbert for 2 months and I haven't found good tacos yet until I came across joyride on Tuesday I'm glad I did. The service was excellent and the tacos were really good the carne asada is the actual real Mexican flap meat there so delicious\n\n\n\n\n\nIncredible atmosphere which is only trumped by the awesome tacos.\nDrinks are poured with a heavy hand.  \nLong time favorite\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved it! My boyfriend and I went out for dinner late, came across this place cause another one was closed. Best accident ever! Not only is the food amazing, the service was great! Very relaxed environment! Highly recommend this place to everyone!\n\n\n\n\n\nwe honestly stopped in because postino was super packed.. so it was kind of a back up plan.  but definitely happy we stopped by.\n\njoyride is super cute.  the decor is fun & the atmosphere is upbeat.  i had to try a mazatlan mule, which ended up being delicious.   we snacked on the chips and salsa & cheese y mas.  the cheese dip was ok.  but the street corn was amazing.\n\ni'll definitely come back to try some of the entrees & more booze. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride was a joyride. Finally made it in after being on my radar for a few weeks. Quite possibly the best tacos I've ever had (carne asada, baja fish, and short rib). Not sure if the 2 star reviewers are on crack, but these tacos were muy delicioso and service was definitely top notch. I can't wait to be able to sit outside in their lawn area with some tacos and brewskies without melting away.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here.  Was disappointed.  Service was great the beer was cold and I enjoyed the salsa but everything else was lacking and over priced.  The wife got a burrito enchilada style...this was nothing like an enchilada style burrito and they'll charge you 2 bucks to put sauce on...the red sauce according to the wife tasted like spaghetti sauce.  They filled the burrito with mushrooms mango red and green peppers rice and chicken...with all of that it was extremely bland.  I got two over priced tacos...the Baja taco that had grilled fish that wasnt very good and the crispy fish taco that was ok but I've had better fish tacos at Rubio's.  For what they charge I don't think we'll be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent food and good service. A little bit on the noisey but everything else more than makes up for it. Very polite staff with a laid back attitude. You can't go wrong with any of the street tacos or a burrito. I definitely recommend trying them out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have a really nice dog friendly patio. The Carne asada is extremely tasty and I would regretting it in the nachos. We had the nicest waitress Shelby and we talked about different places to try while in Phoenix and Tucson. Looking forward to coming back\n\n\n\n\n\nWent out of our way on a Sunday to experience something new, first time to this place was looking forward to a margarita with my boyfriend. We ordered two flavors and we both thought they were too sweet. We  also ordered the ceviche which was so so - very pre-made - not fresh.  Add poor service due to an inexperienced server and understaffing.  Our waitress was missing in action and we had to beg for service from anyone who walked by who looked like the were employed at Joyride.  The only reason we offer 2 stars is for the location.  Great location - which proves that you can survive as a restaurant with bad food and service as long as you have a good location.  Choose any other along the same road and you will do better than we did!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the first Fox restaurants we visited when we came to the area. It never disappoints. You can always expect there to be a little bit of a wait, however, nothing that some visits to the bartender can't help with.  You can't go wrong with any of the tacos and definitely ask for the mango habanero salsa on the side for your chips. The Mexican street corn is the bomb and the service is too!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've had this place bookmarked on yelp to try for awhile so I was excited when to come here with my boyfriend last night. This place is located in downtown Gilbert right next to Postinos. Since it was a Friday night the wait was long but We got there just before the rush so we only had to wait 40min. The inside was very hipster and the servers were all very friendly. They brought out the chips and salsa right away. It was so good we got seconds :) I had a coupon for a free appetizer so we started off with the Ahi Tuna Ceviche. It was a nice twist using ahi tuna on the ceviche instead of the usual shrimp. I got the crispy fish,chicken Tinga and short rib tacos. My boyfriend got the carne Asada, shrimp and Baja fish. I would defiantly recommend the crispy fish and shrimp tacos!!! The tacos were the perfect size and very flavorful. The only down side is that the tacos range from 3.50 to 4.50 per taco. A bit on the pricey side for the small tacos but there so tasty ;) then they gave us free dessert because of how long we had to wait to get our table. They didn't have  to do that for us but we defiantly appreciated it. We ordered the churros and took it home to eat. The churros were nice and crispy! I defiantly would come back & recommend this place to try.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place said they had homemade corn tortilla when I received my order the corn tortillas looked like the were out of a package bought from store terrible service and the host laughed when I asked if they were homemade if you want to see true authentic Mexican food don't come here\n\n\n\n\n\nHad to wait a longgggggg time to get seated. Then a long time to get menus and a long time to get our food. My husband's burrito was good but mine was just mediocre. The music was super loud and I left with ringing in my ears. Probably won't go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's so funny .... when Yelp sees that you've checked into a place on multiple occasions, it asks \"what keeps you coming back?\" ... oh I will tell you what keeps us coming back! Their $5 margarita happy hours!!!!!  They have $5 until 5 pm every day ($5 margaritas or pitchers of beer), then they have Taco Tuesday (which then includes an array of $2 tacos) .... but man, the margaritas are delicious ... the tacos are delicious .... THAT'S what keeps me coming back :)\n\n\n\n\n\nImpeccable margaritas! Bartenders were super friendly and the food was memorable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there on a Saturday night, service was terrible and it wasn't even busy. I tried to order to a mango margarita and was told that they didn't have those on the menu anymore. What!? You have margaritas and mango syrup and you can't make a mango margarita? So I order a soda and it took 10 minutes to get that. I ordered the Carne Asada tacos and it was dry and there was more onion than beef in it. Needless to say won't be returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came across Joyride about a month ago and had it bookmarked with intentions to try very,very soon. Then i saw it in the New Time, \"Best of 2013\" and made it mandatory to get out here pronto! I was sucked in light a moth to a light as soon as we sat down. The atmosphere is so inviting and comfortable..like hanging out in a friends cool backyard.\n\nStarted off with a cup or tortilla soup and Cheese y mas ( warm melted cheesy goodness), both of which were spot on.\n\nMe and my lover boy shared the fried fish taco & braised beef taco and he went all in for The Beast burrito and i went for the cochinita pibil torta. Let me tell you something, Im not usually a totra kinda girl but I switched it up yesterday & Im glad i did because the damn torta rocked my taste buds. We both had leftovers but devoured the rest as a late night snack. \n\nOh yeah, please do try the daily freshly made aguas frescas. \nRecommendation: Cucumber Mint spiked with tequila. ( Hey, i felt somewhat healthy while drinking it)\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst the important thing... The drinks are amazing. Of course they have three of my favorite bartender's in town Megan, Chris, and Diane. The decor is nice and has a good size bar.\n\nNow for the food... We tried a few different kinds of tacos the chicken had a nice spice, the beef was a little salty, and the pork was way to sweet. The chips and salsa rocked. Oh did I mention the margaritas... Lol.\n\nAll and all a cool place to hang out have some cocktails/food. We will be back I wish you were just a little bit closer to home.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally not great. Waited an hour for a table outside because we have really great dogs. After a long wait (which was not great) they called us inside for a table. Not great. We proceeded to wait outside longer for a table and are not having a great experience. Our dogs are also not having a great time and my stomach doesn't feel great. The food runner even insulted my dogs BMI. The hostess stand was not great, food runner was not great either. I'm assuming the food is not great so I'm leaving.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest shrimp tacos and atmosphere. Our favorite place for out of town guests and date night.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I have to say is the veggie burrito \nAnd the salads are delicious!!! \nAND THE CORN!!!! \nThis place is awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's... it's... something missing. Whether it's the staff you have no idea is your staff or a bum on the street serving you I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. The food is okay. The flavor doesn't really jive for me but it's always busy so I'm assuming someone else's taste buds click for The Joy. This is atypical bc I usually eat about anything. I'd say it's definitely a place to try, it just isn't my flavor.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor starters, the place has a lovely atmosphere. We came in on a Saturday afternoon. They had the large roll up doors open, which allowed a nice breeze in, great way to enjoy a nice day. The service was quite slow. Friendly, but a bit inattentive. The complimentary chips were good, with salsa that actually had a nice kick to it. Now for the main foods...\n\nI ordered the Fila salad. Very fresh ingredients and nice presentation. Salads are about $10 a pop, then an extra $3 to add meat. It was good, but nothing to rave about. For $13.50 I just wasn't that impressed. BF ordered the Beast burrito, chimi style, with shredded beef. It was surprisingly bland.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent here for the first time on Friday night and I was very impressed. The staff was attentive and we were well taken care of. The food was amazing and very fresh. This will definitely be our new neighborhood favorite.\n\n\n\n\n\nTried Joyride for a late night taco dinner. The atmosphere was very hip and trendy, fun and inviting. We almost felt like we were back in San Diego! The wait was a bit long but we found out it was worth the wait. The staff was very friendly as well. They have delicious chips and salsa, we couldn't stop eating them! My boyfriend ordered three of the beer battered fish tacos and I ordered three tacos as well, beer battered fish, Carnitas, and chicken. For our side dishes my boyfriend had black beans and I had the orange and cucumber salad. I thought the Carnitas and fish tacos were fantastic although I didn't care for the chicken. My boyfriend said the black beans were fine and my salad was okay. I put a little salt and pepper on it to make it less bland, maybe more than two mini oranges? We did feel the prices were a little high for tacos. However, because the tacos and chips and salsa were so tasty we would absolutely recommend this place, we'll definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food, great music, and bomb Chips and salsa\nOnly reason for not giving it a 5 star was the enchilada sauce tasted like it was from a can. We will be back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent service and even better food! If you're in the old town Gilbert area, you have to give this place a try! You won't be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is delish! I like to get The Beast which is their version of carne asada, it totally knocked my socks off. I also love their chips and salsa, (not sure how they make it so good and not gonna ask!) They have a cool atmosphere as well, its very casual, but the service is still top notch. If you're going on the weekend you might go a little early because it gets super busy. All around its a great restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came for Thursday dinner and was seated pretty quickly. This place has a nice well decorated, dim atmosphere and good service. If you are trying to find a place to sit down and eat this is a good place but the tacos were alright and overpriced. The tacos are small but three seemed like a good amount for me. The pork adobada taco was good and would probably get that again. The carnitas and standard tacos were mediocre, a little plain/dry, and boring. I also got the Mexican slaw that had cabbage, corn, and cheese which was good but not a must have. Also it was disappointing to see they charged extra to refill the chips and salsa. Either I would come back and try some other things besides the tacos or I would come during happy hour/taco Tuesday because they seem to have good deals.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to love this place as I've been wanting to go for quite some time.  I went as I was passing through one day. It was a nice day but I wanted to sit inside as it was a bit windy outside. I asked to be seated away from the open side door but it was still very windy (no big deal though, it is Arizona)... I sat at the bar and the waitress/bartender was very friendly and helpful.  I decided to go with the grilled fish tacos and kale salad.  I was disappointed as the fish was very dry! I probably should have sent them back but I was running late for an appointment and didn't have time.  I would give them another try as the place has a fun atmosphere and I loved the salsa which to me is a food group! Just a little disappointing..\n\n\n\n\n\nI love Upward Projects, but unfortunately, I was not wowed by this place. My friends and I came here for margaritas and tacos on a sunny Saturday afternoon. The guacamole was delicious, but the portion was so small compared to the high price tag. I ordered the crispy fish tacos and the fish was dry dry dry. I think they over fried it because it was really tough. I also ordered a side of the street corn. That was very delicious, but the corn was not cook throughout. \nI will give it one more chance before nixing it. I do however love their $5 drinks before 5pm. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was excellent, service was terrible. I have got to Postinos next door and had the most outstanding service but this place was laughable. First, we had reservations for 6:30 on a Monday and we had to wait with our kids until after 7 to be seated. It is my understanding that it you have  a reservation at a restaurant they will plan for your table to be ready at the time you reserved it.\n\nThen there was our server, Michael. Well, Michael seemed to me not to have a care in the world. We had two tables and I guess two servers. My daughter sat at the other table but we informed Michael that we would like her dinner on our check he said, that's not my table. Um, okay but we still would like her \"kids\" meal on our tab. Okay, I'll take care of that he said. We ordered our meal and he/we forgot our son's \"kid\" meal. I had to wave him down to order it. I said he'll have the quesadilla, Michael asked no other questions. Like what would he like to drink? What side would you like him to have? Nope, just said okay and took off. I had no time to ask for the additional parts of my son's meal. He is 2 and was climbing all over the booth like any other terrible 2 year old. Finally, when I got a second to ask for his chocolate milk I said doesn't he get a side too. Michael said, oh I ordered him the fruit. Um, okay, I hope he likes the \"fruit\" thanks for giving us a choice. I hope he isn't allergic or have some sort of other problem with \"fruit\". Why would he take the chance and just lazily order what \"he\" thought was right for my child. I had to ask twice for the chocolate milk to because Michael forgot.\n\nOh, and guess what? My friends at the other table got the bill for my daughter's meal. Really? After we specifically said, \"please put her meal on our tab\". Instead of trying to get Michael's attention again, we just told our friend we would pay him later and we left because it was getting super late and our kids were melting down.\n\nMichael, you need to learn how to serve people food. It isn't super hard. I did it for 7 years, you just have to care. Maybe go over to Postinos and ask any one of their servers for some training.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is very rare for me to give a five but wow. This place is amazing. It started from the moment we walked in the door.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  The environment was perfect. The music was loud but for some reason I didn't feel like it was overpowering. I was able to hold a conversation without having to speak loud.  You wouldn't think music in the background is important, but the music was hip to the times. The lights were very dim but that made for a romantic atmosphere.  The chips and salsa were delicious. Before the food even came I already had a 5 star review waiting to give them as long as the food was up to far with the rest of the experience.  The waitress was very friendly.  When the food came out it was the best food presentation I have ever seen especially for the price of the food.  It was as if you saw the commercial for food and it actually looked the way it was shown on TV which we all know is very rare.  The burrito was huge. The \"Beast\" burrito was packed full of steak along with fresh cut avocado. It also had pico de gallo and beans inside. It was very filling.  The chicken and carne asada tacos were amazing as well.  Once finished with the main course we had to top it off with some churros.  I couldn't find one thing wrong with this restaurant and I would highly recommend giving it a shot.  I will now be a regular from here on out.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe really enjoyed brunch here last Sunday. The food was good, we really enjoyed the tortilla chips with ceviche. The drinks were fresh and tasty. I would highly recommend trying Joy Ride if you have not yet checked them out.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the BEST Spanish Rice I've ever had - usually not a fan of it in general, but tried it here, and LOVED it. Tacos are good as well, lots of options. Recommend getting several kinds, including the baja taco.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our go to place for good tacos and margaritas. But the last time we were in we got amazing service from a young server named John. We got stuck in the crazy traffic that is the 60 and got there 5 minutes before happy hour ended. He made sure that we got our order in before it ended but assured us in case we needed a few extra minutes he would get our order in at happy hour prices. Definitely tipped him on what the regular price bill would have been and then some. Great work kind sir\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat spot to hang out with friends and catch up on a Saturday night. \n\nThe aguas frescas (with and without alcohol) were delicious, also making it a great place for drinkers and not drinkers alike. We followed the suggested mixings (ie gin and citrus agua fresca), and they were dead on.\n\nThe band was fun and loud but not too loud. \n\nWe had the ahi stack, which tasted very fresh. And the chips were perfect. \n\nWould love to go back. Seemed much more chill and fun than the place (postinos) next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love this place!!! The blood orange margs are the bomb. Our bartender, Ray was awesome and took great care of us all afternoon making a wonderful Sunday Friday. $5 margs are amazing. Great tacos. My fav was the carne adovado....beautiful. Go.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the high price I would have expected better flavor. We had the fish tacos. The presentation was nice, the service was good, but we felt it was too pricey for the experience.  I have to say we are don't drink alcohol so I can't rate the drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have had a lot of Mexican food over the years, some good and some not so good. The Joyride ranks up there with some of the best. Having had the 3 taco combo I choose the \"Standard, Baja Fish & Pork.\" While the Standard and Baja were out of this world the pork was just ok, not my fav at this time. Will need to try it again. The deserts, while only 3 choices available, we choose 2 of the 3 and they were an \"oral orgasm.\" The service exceptional, the ambiance trey KOOL and the food the BEST! I'll be BACK!! ;~)}\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here with a small group of coworkers today and we all had a great time. The staff was very friendly and fun. Our particular waiter looked like he was training someone, but that did not stop him from providing great service to us. Our chip, salsa and drink refills were great. Everyone seemed to like being at work and help out with all tables. It is a little confusing when you aren't quite sure if the man or woman walking by is a waiter or guest, name tags or something would be helpful lol. The menu is nice and simple and the presentation is very clean. Our beans and rice needed a little salt, but that's probably that healthy effort kicking in. I had the carne asada, carnitas and standard tacos, they were sooo good. I WILL be back to try more of their items, I would like to see this place in the evenings. Seems like a cool place to sit and have some drinks. No complaints from anyone in our party, definitely happy with this establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing! It is my weekly go to place for the best tacos and margaritas! My friends and I make it a point to get together here! The employees are always so friendly and it's so clean!\n\n\n\n\n\n4 & 1/2 stars on the food, 3 on atmosphere (music way too loud), 4 on service.  5 of us had 5 dishes, all good to excellent.  Salsa is very tasty, chips hot from the oven.  Just wish the music was down a notch - hard to have a conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place. Great food. Great drinks. Great atmosphere.  They start you off with chips and salsa which I can't get enough of because it's all fresh.  I usually order the tacos and really like the chicken tinga, braised beef, crispy fish, and carnita. Carnitas is definitely my favorite and I think it's the most flavorful out of the bunch.  I've had a couple of other things off their menu as well, like one of the burritos and enchilada, and everything was good.  One thing I have to say is if you get the Mexican corn (which is also good) be prepared to have it on the cob, it's not in a cup, which is what I was expecting. I'm also big on mezcal so I always get the Naked and Famous, but ask them to make it extra smoky (i.e. with more mezcal) and it always tastes great. Atmosphere is nice and relaxed and we've always been able to find a bar seat or a table so you rarely have to wait (a huge plus) and service is fast.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride is a really cool place! I recommend going on Taco Tuesday, for they have specails! It is a laid back open atmosphere, kind of on the hipster side, friendly attentive staff and a decent size menu. I recommend their carne asada tacos, guac and chips and if you are not in the mood for tacos, their enchiladas are pretty tasty. AZ is finally having some awesome weather, go sit out on the patio and have some good food!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love this place. Great food - we've tried every taco option there is! The manager is always extremely friendly and welcoming. Great serving staff. Awesome place for families - we have two very small children and are easily accommodated.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here with a party of 14 during their anniversary week and the place was crazy. I have to say they could not have done a better job considering the situation. I've been before when things weren't so crazy and the service was good but I must say they rose to the occasion! This place has some seriously yummy food and great drinks! Don't let the prices scare you, the quality is there.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I are moving to Gilbert from chandler so decided to try a new date night place. We were both very hungry but knew joyride had good reviews so we went to put our name on the waitlist. Hubby got a little cranky because there was a long wait but we were seated out on their back patio, it was so beautiful with the trees and lights! Once our food arrived he admitted that the wait was well worth it and the food was amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken tinga tacos rock and the Nachos rock. If you enjoy a ace with a vibe that makes you feel welcome no matter who you are. Fancy even though it's got an awesome taco stand energy. This place is like no other delicious food, world class staff, beer selection for real beer drinkers, love for the masses\n\n\n\n\n\nWe started with the chips and salsa and we all enjoyed them and thought they were great. We had the nachos and at first they were great but then we realized they might have needed more cheese. My sister-in-law got the horchata and it's homemade and delicious. If you go here get that to drink. Even if you typically don't like horchata try it. The rest of us got the tacos for dinner. I loved my grilled fish taco but the rest of the group did not love their tacos. They thought they lacked flavor. My brother-in-laws food got forgotten and the manager did bring out the missed meal but no apology. Then about 15 minutes later they tried to bring another plate of food for him. They did offer us free dessert but not because they messed up on his meal but because it was our first time. They took so long for soda refills because everything comes from the bar. They just seemed really unorganized. They could use either more help or a better organizational structure. I don't think we will go back because overall it was not great.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally cool place particularly on a nice day... They open up all the roll up doors and there's a perfect breeze!! Now to the food... VERY yummy!! We had the street corn and the guacamole for starters. Really great my only quibble ( if I have one) would be, it can be a bit tricky cutting the corn off the cob! However it's well worth the wrestle. My hubby had the carnitas taco and the carne asada... I THINK they were delish but.... Someone pigged them all up w/out sharing a bite!!! He said they were GREAT! I had the pork Adabado and the crispy fish (requested corn tortilla rather than flour and they graciously accommodated) they were both amazing! I had a house margarita which was fine but a bit sour... No matter, followed that up w/a kettle one and soda which was sublime! We'll be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nOff work an hour early and want to hang out?  Hip little open-air Mexican joint, is a solid choice.  Clean, fun, patio vibe with great beer pitcher prices and good beer on tap. If you're going for just food, you can do a lot better.  If you're intent is to unwind and graze, very solid choice. Did I mention their happy hour beer prices are awesome?\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tacos, margaritas, and the vibe and servers were fantastic. A perfect place for friends, coworker happy hour or family.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went for lunch and the food was great. We have been waiting for Gilbert to get some good Mexican food, and this place seems to have it. The chips and salsa was good, the service was good as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the vibe of this place! Upscale enough to give you a comfortable environment on a date but also casual enough to call this your go to spot with friends or your family. The staff are all so sweet. From the girls at the desk trying to accommodate seating arrangements on a busy night to the waitresses that go out of their way to visit their repeat customers while managing their tables when they don't get to serve you. The fact they remember you gives you a warm inviting feeling. I've been going there for years so I've picked my favorite waitress but I don't always get seated with her so found other waitresses to be good too. Tor is by far my favorite, my whole family loves her. If you see this review, ask for Tor, you will have a warm experience. Tacos! Omg! You will love them but other people do too... make sure you give yourself enough time to eat and experience the place without rushing off to another location. Dinner time on Taco Tuesday is a bit of a wait. Why? Because people love it of course and I'm sure they'll agree with my review.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 1000 reviews and a solid 4 stars. I have to agree. \n\nI was not terribly hungry, but I've wanted to try this place for a while and we were in the neighborhood -- so, I *apparently* dragged my less-than-excited family over the threshold here to give it a shot. \n\nThe provided chips were cooked well and had both nice texture and flavor. The accompanying salsa was good as well. Always a good sign. \n\nI started with an almond horchata, which was good, but is served with ... chopped pecans (??) in it. Okay... it was more of a garnish than anything, but I had to double-check the menu to make sure I hadn't read it wrong.  I did not get mine \"spiked,\" but they do offer their aguas frescas with booze in them if you're into that. I think something neutral like vodka would be OK in horchata... or maybe rum(?), but anything else would either get lost in the horchata or lose the horchata completely. My opinion, though.\n\nOne of the kids ordered the black beans on the side, which I was able to try and I agree that they are very tasty (\"da bomb\" ? Maybe. They'd be more likely to get that from me if they mixed the beans with some nice chunky pico de gallo right before serving them). Still the black beans get a thumbs-up: good flavor and texture. \n\nI ordered two tacos from the list: Crispy Fish and Chicken Tinga. I liked the chicken one a lot, but found the fish one to be just OK. The fish was just a little dry and kind of bland. I would try the grilled fish next time. I also ate the guacamole that came with the quesadillas that the others ordered. It was tasty, although I like mine a little chunkier. Again, personal preference, not holding that against them. \n\nOne of the boys had three carne asada tacos and, wow, did he put them away fast! This is the kid who is frequently \"not hungry\" when we go for Mexican food, so it was a little surprising. It was less so once I'd had a chance to try the carne asada in my wife's quesadilla. This meat was cooked very well and had that flame-touched, fatty, beefy taste and juicy texture that makes meat-eaters so happy. Apparently, that worked for him.\n\nI found the service to be very good and the food arrived quickly. Our server, Miranda, kept our drinks topped off, handled the payment quickly, and thanked us for coming in.\n\nThis was a Sunday night, and the place was pretty full inside. The patio still had some seats, and there was no wait. I don't know what the crowd looks like on a weeknight -- or during taco Tuesday -- but it might get crazy... if you can find parking!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the \"standard\" taco. Also, the Elote and Agua Fresca's are delicious. Tortillas are always fresh! 4 stars because: A little over priced when not doing happy hour and they give you a huge basket of chips with a TINY portion of salsa  (refills on the salsa cost extra).\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a cute place! I have been obsessed with Joyride for the past 6 months. All They're tacos are amazing. The Fila salad is also great. The first time my boyfriend got the Mexican street corn he said every single person should have this on they're table. And he's not usually impressed by food. I have never been disappointed with the food drinks or service at joyride.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch fantastic service here. The staff works as a collaborative group and np drink is left behind. \nLove the modern ambiance and local art on the walls. \nCannot beat th Wie happy hour specials either!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place. But will miss the outdoor seating area. The margaritas and shrimp taco's are my favorite!! The cucumbers salad is so refreshing. The atmosphere is seriously cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great place! The vibe was fabulous with great seating (indoor and outside), the decor is vintage fab! Servers are attentive and friendly and the food (my God!), devine!!! I ate until my stomach was uncomfortable, but I couldn't stop! The portions are generous and ordering the Mexican street corn is a must!!! This has been one of the best eating experiences I've had in a long time. An over all ten!\n\n\n\n\n\nVery annoyed at the service. You don't have one specific waiter or waitress and at one point someone took my soda to be refilled. Well they never brought it back. I asked multiple severs to return my drink but went without almost my entire dinner, and they still charged me for it! Not to mention the tacos are overpriced. The food is pretty good but nothing to rave about.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Love Love This Place.\n\nWe went on a Sunday afternoon and were able to take advantage of the Happy Hour that runs till 5pm all day every day. The guys stuck with the pitchers of beer, while us girls tried out a few of the \"coctels\" and \"agua frescas\" My favorite was the Mazatlan Mule.\n\nWe started with the nachos and found them to be amazing. Ordinary nachos just will not do it for me ever again.\n\nIt was hard to decide on what tacos to order, they all sounded great, and no one was disappointed in what was placed before us. The carnitas, short rib and shrimp were among the favorites. \n\nAnd don't forget to order a few sides....among the best were the mexican street corn and the heirloom anasazi beans\n\nWe cannot wait for much cooler weather so we can enjoy the great outdoor seating they have\n\nSo run to Joyride Taco House if you are in the area....\n\n\n\n\n\nLong story short, food has no flavor, water has no ice, kids meal they forgot to bring us the kids beverage.  Asked for more salsa and they charged extra $2.  Indoor very noisy.   Good to try per high reviews, but won't go back or recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place, great food and great addition to Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nI ordered a chicken tinga taco and carne asada taco. The chicken one was super flavorful. I really liked it. \n\nThe only thing that could have been better is their chips. They were airy and not very good. \n\nThe waiter was super sweet. This is a cool place to hang out for lunch or dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can't go to a taco place and not try the tacos right!? \n\nMy friend told me about this place and wanted to try it out. When you first sit down you get complementary chips and salsa. It was nothing special. It was a bit spicy for my taste. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the crispy fish taco. I wasn't too fond of the carne asada tacos. It was a bit dry and bland and I felt like it needed sauce or sour cream or something with it. The crispy fish tacos were really good though. Beer battered fish AND guacamole got me! lol. I washed everything down with the strawberry Agua Fresca. It was delicious! It has vodka, gin and rum in it. I'd like to try their \"spiked\" horchata next time I come. For dessert we ordered the churros con chocolate which was quite yummy. =)\n\nThe customer service was really good. We were always taken care of and the staff is very knowledgeable of their menu. \n\nThe only negative for me was there was no sign on the restaurant! I drove up and down the street for like 15 minutes and I couldn't find it. I had to call my friend to find out where it was. The only sign they have is on the door. Which is definitely not noticeable at night time. I know they are a new establishment but I felt like a huge sign should've been the first thing to take care of. I never would've found it at all. \n\nAll in all, I really liked their drinks and will probably come back during happy hour to try the rest of their drink menu. =)\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent street tacos on taco tuesday for $2 each. Corn tortillas are made fresh and pretty soft considering they are corn. Crispy fish taco was the best, carnitas and steak 2nd best. Nice space, indoor / outdoor.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon arriving for happy hour today, we ordered our first rounds of beverages and tacos. For round two a 29 minute wait for extra salsa and series of drinks was more than enough for our party of 6 to have some laughs and question the bar service and untimely delivery of Luke warm food.... apparently the ticket was lost by our new waitress. Complimentary round. Well call it fair-ish\n\n\n\n\n\nI have only been here on taco Tuesday. It starts getting really busy at 4pm so we went for an early dinner. Very friendly staff and we were checked on several times. The tacos were great and cheese quesadilla was also tasty!\n\n\n\n\n\nbomb.com and a great happy hour too!\n\n\n\n\n\nWell after a few recommendations and some yelp reviews we decided to try it. Over all a disappointment for all the hype. 50 minute wait. 30 minute wait from the time we ordered appetizer until food arrived...uhm before the appetizer. I had 3 way overpriced \"street tacos\" crispy fish, shrimp, and shredded beef. Both the fish and shrimp were cold, the beef barely warm...wife's were adequately warm. Over all tacos all kind of tasted the same was my wife's comment. I agreed. Appetizer finally came...ahi tostada (on the house at this point) it was good...but nothing to write home about...was not seasoned at all. It's amazing what a little salt and pepper can do for a dish folks. A double rum and coke set me back 14 dollars wtf? The moes definitely desert? Uhmmm runny and grainy boxed pudding, a clump of sliced banana, Carmel and salted pecans...pecans and Carmel were the best part etc...thrown together...but tasted pretty good...not worth 6 bucks. Our server was pleasant enough but forgetful apparently. Short term memory problems? Lol\n\nAll said and done ? 64 dollars for one app, two entrees, one desert and two drinks. \n\nI don't know what the uber positive reviews are all about I'm thinking you waited a long time and had a few too many by the time your table was ready hence...\"everything was so good\"...really over priced, under seasoned, poorly executed simple food. Trying to ride on the hipster local and decor  and forgetting that the food and service is the thing. \n\n We decided we will go try it one more time just make sure it wasn't an accident. Will update after.\n\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE this place. Amazing food & great service. The happy hour is totally worth it. They are always so friendly with our kids and usually remember us.\n\n\n\n\n\nCallie is the best server they have the best happy hour pricing and amazing margaritas. Good environment to bring friends and family\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service was amazing Cisco had great energy and table presence. The cevice was fresh the kids meal was amazing and our meal perfect. I recommend joyride 100%\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, I don't understand all the positive reviews this place has. I've been there twice now and both times it was truly the worst customer service I've had at a restaurant/bar in recent memory. \nBoth times we've waited at least 10 minutes after sitting down for anyone to come by and take drink orders, had at least 4 different people serving us through the course of our meal and felt like total inconveniences for the staff. \nThe last time I was there I ordered a vodka cranberry and I kid you not, the waitress said \"is that on the menu?\" I just stared at her and said, umm.. I'm not sure. I didn't look at the drink menu\". A vodka cranberry? Really? \nThe only things I like about joyride are the location and the food is great too. However, with such terrible customer service I'll eat food I like less elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward to a return visit. We all tried the blood orange margarita's and they were very good. Looking forward to trying the pineapple mojito on my next visit. I loved the chicken, corn and poblano tamale. I wish the rice was more of a mexican rice but the grilled vegetables with the dish were very tasty. My husband is still talking about the street corn. All in all we had a great meal. When the weather is nice the outdoor seating would be great. It was a little loud inside but too hot to enjoy the outside space.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood drinks, food was tasty. The nachos with carne asada was the best. Must try! \n \nReally busy when we arrived but put myself on the waitlist before we got there. I would suggest you do the same because it could be a long wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nDear God in Heaven, there is a burrito here called \"The Beast\" that is, hands down, the best burrito I've ever eaten. I'm not kidding, WOW! Also, the quesadilla with chicken was pretty much the second greatest thing I've ever eaten. A little pricey? Sure.. Worth it? I'd say so.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOVE, LOVE, LOVE the food!!!  \nTons of healthy choices!  So fresh and delicious!!!!\n\nAwesome staff!   Very attentive, friendly and on top if it!!!\n\nGoing back and taking every friend I have!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe come here for Taco Tuesday's all the time.  Their tacos are great and if you get there before 5 PM, you can get a pitcher of beer for $5.  Love this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is definitely not the original joy ride taco shop. It's worth the drive to go to the one in Phoenix, the Gilbert location is horrible. Couldn't get our order right, then when we get our food is 70% beans. I ordered extra meat and all you could taste was beans. Night and day difference between the Phoenix location and Gilbert. When Gilbert first opened it was on par with Phoenix, but last couple times it seems like they are being cheap and putting a lot of beans in your food. Need to balance everything out a lot better, your Carne Asada is probably the best in the valley, let people taste that flavor. I'll never return to the Gilbert location.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really love the decor & the feel of this restaurant! The servers are all pretty nice too! I wish I knew the name of the server who took care of our big group of 23 people- she was awesome! \n\nI had the Lola Grain salad (It may seem crazy that I had salad at a taco place). It was DELICIOUS! One of the best salads I've ever had really! It tastes healthy & full of flavor! (I had it without the bell pepper!) \n\nI've tried a couple of the tacos- they are a little too \"different\" for my taste, but they aren't bad- just not for me. \n\nI had the mango-mandarin margarita & it was very tasty! Many people love the prickly pear margarita, they are bright pink & really attractive for a cocktail! \n\nI highly recommend the salad, chips & salsa & drinks here!\n\n\n\n\n\nHave been here a few times and the food is really good.  The one star is all about the service. I met a few friends here last night and we sat on the patio.  Drinks and chips were brought out immediately.  We placed our food order and then our server quickly walked away. All of our drinks were empty along with a few of our water glasses. Once we received our food we again had to track down our server to get another round of drinks, including water. After we finished our meal our dirty plates, along with empty chips bowls sat for another good 30 minutes never being picked up until we asked. They have very good margaritas here and all of us would have enjoyed another one....to no avail.  Became more of a job to try to get our servers attention than it was worth.\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably the most disappointing restaurant on the Gilbert road strip. So the atmosphere is cool and the restaurant itself is well designed. Just like the other restaurants on this strip it looks nice. But just like my ex girlfriend what is on the outside is nothing like on the inside. \n\nThe waiter was clueless and the tacos were so bad they could barley call themselves tacos. The kids nachos were also pretty pathetic. It was like a tiny bit of cheese on top of the chips thst come out with the salsa. It was honestly annoying. I'll just stick to going to going to mariscos in Phoenix for good tacos. You're better off going to the taco place across the street if you want that kind of place on Gilbert road. \n\nSo wouldn't ever go back and don't recommend. But I never regret spending money at a business in Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent authentic food!  Delicious cucumber margarita!  Outdoor seating is part sun and part shade. Inside seating is modern retro with good music.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, what a bad experience.   We ate here back in July and loved it.   This time it was totally different.   Flies filled the restaurant, the taco meat was fatty and the salads were wilted.   Luckily the manager, Daniel, dropped the bill, but they need to make some changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat food! But not worth the HORRIBLE SERVICE! Took about 15 mins for drinks that included a dr pepper. The server said the bartender is working hard... On my dr pepper?? Asked for more chips and salsa 3 times. Never got them. Food came out fast though. Will not go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I made a date night here for their $2 Taco Tuesday with $5 Margaritas, and it did not disappoint! The wait time for a table was a tad long , but that's pretty much expected for $2 tacos that are AMAZING , totally worth the wait! Joyride Taco House has a fun atmosphere, with great service , and the food and drinks were amazing! Some of best tacos we have had , the fish taco was by far my favorite! The Tropical Margarita was super tasty as well. Can't wait to go back for more Taco Tuesday at Joyride Taco House!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place! I bring friends, colleagues, and family here all the time. Tony one of the bartenders is cool as hell, and goes out of his way to ensure we are comfortable every time we visit. \nKeep in mind it gets busy!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is definitely \"Mexican\" food for the white people of Gilbert. I had the veggie burrito and +1 had some sort of seafood tacos. The veggie burrito was good, but a bit bland. The green whatever sauce it came with was also pretty bland. Chips and salsa were pretty dope though. Pro tip: ask for salsa to go with the burrito instead of the green stuff they give you.\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived tonight on a Tuesday about 4:45. The wait was 45 min.  We got a seat at the bar and was able to order beer during happy hour. We were not offered another round before 5. Got seated in just about the time expected, however did not see a waitress for at least 15 min. Finally ordered but service was minimal. Food is very good, thus why we have returned. Asked for hotter salsa and was charged for it after waiting 10 min after the food arrived. Used to think service was tops, but now that more restaurants have opened they have to step up their game especially on a Tuesday. I can rarely make it on a Tuesday so I really wanted to go. Will rethink options next time I have the chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was very impressed with Joyride.\nWe had many different tacos...all of them were awesome.\nMy GF said the fish tacos were fantastic.\nThe salsas that we tried were great and the ambiance was also very nice.\nWe had a very nice server.\n\nOnly tried it once so far but i'll be going often\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely love the hippie sublime cool vibe. The service was friendly but slow. Weekends expect to wait but you can stop by postino for a drink and they Text you when your seat is ready. Tacos and salads are good and unique. Service for food was slow but it was also a Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nKept seeing friends posting pictures from here so figured it would be worth a shot. The cocktails were refreshing and unique. My favorite was the agua Fresca cucumber with vodka. The tacos were great too!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place, gave them 4 stars when they opened, bumping them up to 5 now.. The aqua frescas are not the best (kinda watery) but the tacos are LEGIT!!! so good, yum!!\n\n\n\n\n\nProps to the Sioux chef @Louis, came out and greeted us, made sure our tacos were on point and thanked us. Great food and a great experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a mini-staycation in Gilbert this weekend.  We started at a big bar in the evening, but decided we weren't ready for that.  So we walked over to Joyride Saturday night and had the best experience!!  We were seated immediately in a cute little restaurant w great views of Downtown Gilbert.  We ordered fish tacos, spicy chicken nachos, and then had several margaritas.  One of us had the regular house marg, which was great but the other two of us had the cucumber Serrano margs which were FANTASTIC!!  At one point, we also had tequila shots and our waiter Hunter tracked me down some cinnamon to make them to my request.  Our service was AMAZING (thanks Michael and Hunter) and we just had a great time!!  Would highly recommend and definitely come back!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe live in Awhatukee but take the drive to Gilbert for this amazing place! What a unique and fun place to go relax in or outside. The vibe is cool and contemporary.\n\nThe food is excellent and has a vast array of choices, The street tacos are out of bounds. The Mexican corn is unlike anything I have had. \n\nWe have had Cisco 3 times and he is nothing short of a superstar he can do a hundred things at one time and very attentive.\n\nThis last weekend not only did we eat there for lunch we brought back a newcomer and friend the next day .\n\nThis place is a GEM\n\n\n\n\n\nDecided to check out Joyride since we are addicted to Mexican food in our family. We tried the Mexican street corn and it was delicious but the rest of the food didn't live up to the hype. I'd eat here again but I honestly suggest eating at another taco place downtown.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid. Great service! Food was very good. Price is right and you should not be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy best friend and I recently went here a couple of weeks ago. It was the absolute most amazing tacos I've ever had. I might be over selling a tad bit, BUT this definitely a place you want to try out, their tacos are seriously great tasting. I'd love to come back soon and try out the burrito next, my friend said their burrito was amazing. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of it. Please check out this place, it's amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica is the greatest server! She turned our night around completely & was super attentive. Made our experience that much better! We definitely will come back more often because of her service.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was delicious but they need to get the flies under control. We were dining inside and still had to constantly swat them away from our food. Felt a little rushed out the door at the end of the meal. Other than that it was good.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Taco Tuesday ever!  I tried three different tacos, the Standard, the Crispy Fish, and the Pork Abadobo.  All were great!  Some spicy, some with crunchy slaw, fresh avocado, and just the right balance of flavors.  Impressive beer list.  I had a Deshuttes Black Butte; paired nicely with the spicy tacos.  Service was outstanding; only waited about 10 minutes for a table for two.   Packed house.  Family friendly but great tunes playing as well.  Heated patios.  Loved it.  Can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat place. Great food. Kids loved taco tuesday experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nI enjoy the going to Oldtown Gilbert and this was one of the restraunts Ive always wanted to try. The service was excellent. Our food came fast and was hot. We ordered the standard chicken tacos. Other wise it wasnt too spicy. Since it was happy hour they were only $2.00 each. They were tiny, but surprisingly filling. The atmosphere was similar to the breakfast place next door. It was loud and almost had to yell across the table just to have a conversation. Desert menu only offered three items. We didnt see any desert we liked so went to another restaurant nearby for desert. Other than that I would recommend this place if you are looking for something quick and tasty.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved it! I brought my dad here for a Father's Day lunch. The service was terrific! They had just opened a few weeks ago. The cocktails and Aqua Frescas were    unique and so delicious. I was told that they come in early to prepare the drink mixes from scratch. I tried three tacos; the fish was my favorite. The chicken was a bit spicy, the pork was ok. I will definitely return and will be bringing my friends!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reading all of the great reviews on Yelp, we decided to give Joyride Taco House a try. My parents, kids, sister, nephew and myself arrived right at opening so we could avoid the busy lunchtime rush. We were quickly seated and the first thing I noticed was the abundance of flies. I'd read about the fly issue, but was surprised by how many there were. I spent the entire meal swatting them away from my face, food and drink. I love restaurants with indoor/outdoor seating and understand that sometimes flies get in, but I've never seen a restaurant have as much of a fly problem as Joyride. Unfortunately, the flies weren't the only problem.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat dcor and I loved the vibe of the place.\nThe outdoor seating area is amazing - I could see myself returning for a girl's night out\n\nCons:\n\nFlies - See first paragraph for details.\n\nDirty dishes - two out of seven plates were dirty and one of our cups was dirty, I understand that sometimes dishes don't get clean, but a little due diligence would prevent a plate with a dime-sized piece of food finding its way to customers.\n\nFood was subpar - Although I prefer more traditional Mexican food, I knew that \nJoyride has its own eclectic take on the cuisine and so I was prepared for the food to be different. Unfortunately, it wasn't just different but most of it lacked depth of flavor. The pinto beans and chili rellenos were bland and the kid's nachos were topped with the odd-tasting cheese. On the other side of the spectrum was the overly sweet carne asada. As an Arizona native I've tried a bevy of different carne asada marinades over my lifetime, but never have I tried one as sweet as Joyride's. Even though I have a sweet tooth, it was off putting. My nephew and my sister agreed.\n\nHit & Miss:\n\nService - The service started off great - we were seated quickly and our waitress was attentive - explaining various menu items and checking on us several times. Then she disappeared for about 10 minutes. Once we ordered, most of the food was delivered but they forgot one side and my nephew's entire meal. Thankfully the tacos cook quickly and so he didn't have to wait for long.\n\nOverall: Not one of the seven of us said we would return for lunch or dinner. My sister and I said we'd give Joyride another try and meet with friends for drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here and absolutely incredible!! Definitely will be back, Carna aseda burrito was the best!\n\nThey even have fresh Jalepanos !!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we were seated..... we waited almost 10 min. for service and they weren't even busy!! They didn't bring is chips and salsa until we asked, my husbands water glass was dirty. They are overpriced. Did I say they are Overpriced!? Ordered ceviche for 12.95. Surprised at how small the portion was. Ordered guacamole and that too was pricy and the portion small. Usually appetizers are meant for sharing but for those portions and prices I won't order either one again.....the drink my hubs ordered was not refillable. We were not told that prior to ordering... all and all less than stellar experience. Sorry to say we won't be back. Postino is next store so will be going there instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to celebrate our daughter's six month birthday. We odered veggie enchiladas and veggie burrito. Ohhhh my god. It was the best mexican food we have ever had. Whatever you can think of like salsa sauce, green sauce or their complementary chips... (a lot of) , even the customer service you gonna definately fall in love with everything. They feed with the open heart...\nHa ha. \nMy husband and I have decided to eat mexican food only at this place. It was wonderful ride dear joyride.\n\n\n\n\n\nPleasantly surprised! The nachos were delicious but the chicken was rubbery. Other than that, great flavors!\n\n\n\n\n\nReally cool place! Very hip and young vibe and environment. The decor was eccentric but modern. The menu was creative Mexican food with a modern twist. The nachos were really good, they used a really good white cheese. The tacos are also pretty good, the shrimp especially are tasty. Friendly helpful staff. The have creative alcoholic drinks and you can add alcohol to their agua frescas.We will for sure  go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive star rating is for the great food:  Baja fish taco, braised beef, and carne asada taco--all great! Chips and salsa also fresh and very good.  Service on the other hand was subpar.  Not bad enough to lose me forever.  Since the food was so good I will give them another shot...just hope service is better this time.\n\nUpdate -  had to bring down to a four after eating at barrio queen--new standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter driving past this place and looking at the menu online, I thought Joyride would be the perfect taco place for me. They have a few vegetarian options, cool sounding drinks, and the atmosphere looked fun. I was a tad disappointed however.\n\nThere were some things I really liked about Joyride, and some things I did not like so much. One good thing was the service, the servers were very attentive. Even a few servers who were not our server for the night came up to check on us, which I thought was nice. I also liked the decor, very mod and I like the color scheme.\n\nI ordered three veggie tacos with the cucumber orange salad as my side. It is nice they you get to have a free side with three tacos. The tacos were good but not great. The first one I ate had a soggy tortilla, the other two tortillas were fine. Also there was a tiny piece of something hard and inedible in my first taco, which was unpleasant. I wish I would have ordered the black beans as my side instead too because the salad was kind of gross. Also the side would have cost $4.00 which is ridiculous for like 3 cucumber spears, 2 mandarin orange segments, and a few seeds. I tried to like it, but I just couldn't! Also my boyfriend got the Key Largo drink, and I am glad I did not order one because I was not a fan. He thought it was too vanilla-y, but did not totally hate it. The chips and salsa were yummy though, so there is a plus.\n\nAnother downside was the price. Mine wasn't too bad, but my boyfriend's meal was nearly $30 for a drink, burrito, and a taco. Overall, Joyride is not bad, but did not quite meet my expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey quoted a wait time of 1 hour. We waited patiently for 1 1/2 and there were still 8 people ahead of us! Their hostesses can't estimate wait time for anything!! They weren't even concerned or apologetic about it. I told them we were going to go elsewhere so she could remove our name, and all she said was \"OK\". VERY DISAPPOINTED!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe queso was really good! And the margaritas where huge. This place gets really busy, but we were able to find a bar seat pretty quickly. They have awesome taco Tuesday specials!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a modern style Mexican restaurant.I loves the decoration here. If you are a  big fans of  80's 90's movie and star wars, you will love it.\n\nThe food tastes so good. My favorite is shrimps taco. The service is great as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this place. It's always busy, great drinks, food is well above average. I always enjoy myself. Service can be a little slow but everyone is pretty friendly. As it stands today I will be back but there's a lot of other options now downtown Gilbert so my visits are less frequent. That may change. Still getting a feel as to how much I like the newer restaurants. We'll see.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was prompt and friendly but the food was overpriced and skimpy. The Baja fish tacos needed more sauce and fish was dry. Carne asada was tasteless and dry. Very disappointing.\n\n\n\n\n\nShared several different tacos with the wife and they were all great.  I had a Margaritas and it was also very well prepared! I will certainly be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace looks awesome, has great music and great waiters. \nMenu is a little pricey. \n\nI got the Baja fish taco and cochinita pibil taco and they were both amazing! But small.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest burrito on the planet. Great nachos. Awesome tacos. One of my favorite places to eat.\n\n\n\n\n\nSitting at the bar... Super slow had to practically do jumping jacks to get service  sitting at the bar really??.. Food way over priced for what it is and was really bad.. carne asada ??wtf horrible. Cheap beer is the only good thing that's if you can get a drink  from the snooty want to be server/ bartenders... I know what ppl have been saying in the Gilbert community and its obvious there is no way this is a four star joint... Fake reviews forsure buyer beware.\n\n\n\n\n\nDid a fast lunch here. Not too bad but a bit pricy for 2 tacos, 1/2 salad and an iced tea. $14  It all was good including salsa and chips. For this price I would expect at least 3 tacos or larger than the street taco sized tacos they did serve. No doubt you're paying for decorum and location more so than food. Not bad but not great.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarted with the guacamole last night, which was delightful. Lots of flavor and crunchy texture from the onions and cilantro. Ordered a strawberry fresca and it delighted my taste buds. I didn't even feel bad drinking it because it is just pure yummy juice....no artificial colors or flavors...just strawberry goodness over ice! \nFor my entree, I ordered a salad. I can't remember the name now, but I did take a photo to add to my review of how perfect it looked when it arrived. It tasted as good as it looked. I added chicken to it, which was too seasoned for my taste, but the rest of the salad was killer. So many unique flavors combining together that each bite tasted better than the last. The dressing came on the side and I didn't even use it! That should tell you how natural packed the salad was with flavor. This will be my go to salad for sure. I'll update my review next time with the name of it. (Yelper fail) \nThe manager came over to check on us multiple times and was so eager to make sure our experience was on point. One of the most involved, and active upper management people I have come across in all my years of dining out. He really made us feel like we were old friends of his, eating at his personal restaurant. Lots of pride in what he does, and what his restaurant serves. HE is what set my review over the top and puts Joyride at a solid 5. I will also figure out the managers name and update this review with that as well. Clearly I was in some sort of food heaven/coma that gave me amnesia of the specifics of my review. Non the less- go here if you want CLEAN modern Mexican food.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just went yesterday for TACO TUESDAY! I just loved the crispy fish tacos and the carne asada. There are about 8 options each for two bucks. Next time I will try the horchata, but overall a great date with my love!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely delicious!! We were first timers today and we were very pleased with the food. I had a carne asada, pork, and chicken taco and I am stuffed, SO GOOD. I recommend it to anyone!! Go on taco Tuesday or during happy hour when the tacos are cheaper!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is so cute! Love the decor and the staff. \nPatio was great and the food was really fresh and flavorful. The tortillas here are awesome! I also had the cucumber mint aqua fresca which was really refreshing - perfect for a hot day!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove love this place!! Great tacos, great salads, great ahi stacks, great salsa, great drinks (and like the non alcoholic options as well), great lunch specials, great service. I wish there was one in the tempe/Scottsdale area!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a slam dunk. Fresh and delicious food with generous portion sizes. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options. Knowledgeable and attentive staff, cute decor and fun atmosphere. The food is very flavorful and they also have great drinks! What more could you ask for?!\n\n\n\n\n\nWent tonight for the first time to take advantage of the anniversary taco special. The food was good and the service was outstanding. I can't even remember the last time I've felt that good about the service in any restaurant in the valley.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time to Gilbert and stumbled into this place at 2pm on a Thursday so no wait.  I'm a taco connoisseur and this was a good one.  Wife and I had the carne, 'Standard' and veggie tacos - helped that it was happy hour and tacos were only $2/taco but will be back.  BTW - service (Mo) was excellent!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride Taco House is AMAZING! We ate there last Sunday and I have wanted to eat there every day since. \n-Trio of ceviche is delicious! So so fresh and the flavor combinations are wonderful.\n-Mexican street corn, yummy!\n-We tried the shrimp, carne asada, carnitas, and carnitas tacos and they were all good.\n-Banana pudding and churros for dessert, I'm in heaven.\n-The drinks were insanely tasty. Must trys are the Key Largo and Pineapple Mojito. Also tried the Strawberry Agua Fresca with Rum. I wanted to try them all but we were so full. \nEverything was so fresh and delicious and the vibe of this place is do cool I felt like I was on vacation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince having a daughter with celiac disease, we are always on the lookout for gluten-free friendly places. All their GF items are marked on the menu, even their tortilla chips are gluten-free, where many restaurants contaminate the chips by frying them in the same fryer used on breaded items. \n\nEverything we have had here so far was excellent. Baja and carnitas tacos rank as my favs. I also think their tortilla soup is outstanding. I don't do a lot of mixed drinks, but my wife loves the blood-orange margarita. I tasted it. Good and strong. The atmosphere is nice, staff is on their game and bathrooms were clean. \n\nOnce it gets cooler, this place will be even better. They can open large doors to two separate patios. Maybe even bring in some talented, live local music, like Vinyl Station.\n\n\n\n\n\nI won't return to this location again. There was HAIR in my food and the server says \"Oh gross, I'll get that re made for you\".  Not even an apology. A manager never stop by to check in either. Not once were my kids drinks refilled or offered a refill on the chips. It wasn't even busy, it was 3pm on a week day.  My family has been in the restaurant business for years, a manager should always stop and check on tables especially when there was a problem at the table.  Thank goodness the Phoenix location is closer to where I live and the service has been top notch.\n\n\n\n\n\nWife and I stopped in for an early dinner tonight. It's our first time to Joyride. Saw they had $2 taco deal. I ordered a pork adobada, carne asada and crispy fish. The pork had an expected amount of meat. Taste was ok. The carne asada had a good flavor but all but one bite was full of nasty grisly meat. My fish taco only had enough breading to eat half the taco. I say breading because they was very little actual fish. My wife had a chicken taco and fish taco and she was satisfied with hers. Service was excellent. Ambiance is excellent. Bathroom was clean. I was so disappointed with my tacos that we won't be coming back. After all Joyride TACOS should deliver excellent tacos - right?\n\n\n\n\n\nOh My Land.... the tacos here are phenomenal. Loved the shrimp taco, the fish taco, and the carne asada taco. The guacamole is amazing as well. Service is very attentive and they were REALLY busy when we visited. The beer selection is small but good, and the place has a wonderfully friendly vibe. We loved it!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is amazing. Insanely good tacos (try the crispy fish), unbelievable service and incredible atmosphere. Hopefully your server is Taylor because she rocks and is spot on with recommendations for drinks, entrees and dessert. Awesome place. Can't wait to come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI met a few co-workers for the end of happy hour and Cinco de Mayo yesterday. Located in downtown Gilbert next to Postinos, Joyride is almost always packed. We opted for first table available and were seated within 10 minutes in the patio. Our server was wonderful. He gave us great recommendations on drinks! We ordered the classic and blood orange margaritas, $5 special for the day. It was pretty strong but good. Then we placed an order for tacos! They have a diverse menu and had gluten free options. I had carnitas tacos. They were so beautiful I felt a little guilty eating them. The chips and salsa kept coming and I was glad it did. Everything is house made and you can tell. The ambiance is trendy and relaxing. I will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\n\n$2 dollar tacos every day and not just on taco Tuesday's along with $5 dollar margarita's awesome happy hour seating available every day but Tuesday's are slammed busy...\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tacos at a great price!  It was extremely busy during lunch but there is always room at the bar.  The service was fantastic.  Chips and salsa included with the meal is a sign of a true Mexican restaurant.  Loved it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best happy hour in Gilbert! The chicken tinga tacos are amazing and the street is to die for! And you can't go wrong with their pineapple margarita!\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our first visit to Joyride Taco House on July 7th we have been there numerous times.  We are huge fans of Upward Projects restaurants.  It's one of those restaurants where you just like \"being\" there.  Great music, great service, yummy food and don't get me started on the Mazatlan Mules-hands down my favorite current drink!!\n\n\n\n\n\nFood was great!  Had 3 tacos and some hot mess-thing with eggs on top which was pretty awesome.  Service was even better!  Only not giving 5 stars since I didn't have anything that I think will absolutely compel me to go back.  That being said, I would go there again and recommend it to friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a to go order there about 45 minutes before they closed. Had never eaten there but drive by it a lot. Got the 2 battered fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos. Took about 20 minutes for a to go order and they weren't busy. \n\nI went straight home but found that the food wasn't warm. After biting in, I realized I probably should have heated it up. Not bad but not very flavorful. Overall ok and I'm not going to turn down tacos. They also forgot my side that was supposed to come with the meal. There is another taco chop nearby that I'm sticking with.  I will give them 5 stars for their churros though. I'm really picky about churros and these were great. \n\nI tried it which was my goal but I don't really see myself returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nTried it out for the first time this weekend. The drinks (Agua frescas with alcohol) and food were good. I ordered a couple of tacos, and my friends also enjoyed the good (tacos and vegetarian burrito). \n\nHowever, the service was blah. They forgot an item and drink we ordered, and they arrived about 20 minutes later. So late that everyone else was done eating. There seemed to be confusion over who was managing our table- different people kept stopping by to tell us the food and drink were coming, but we continued to wait. They did credit our bill, and I'm willing to give them another shot because I liked the food and drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent there on a whim during a rare kid-free date with my husband and it was a great experience. The food was delicious. I had the garden variety burrito which was chockfull of delicious, perfectly seasoned veggies and my husband had the Sidewalk Surfer Chilaquiles, which have egg which sounds weird for dinner but according to my better half it worked. The drinks were also delicious and our waitstaff was friendly and efficient. I'd definitely go there again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been to Joyride many times, but this is based on my most recent trip. All of my visits have been 4/5 stars. First, their happy hour is AMAZING! $5 (small) pitchers of cerveza, $5 margs, and cheap tacos! I would classify Joyride as American/Mexican, as opposed to the more authentic Barrio Queen down the strip. That being said, they have a lot of taco options and most are good! My menu go to is the Carne Asada Burro (can't remember the exact name of it), but it is delicious with red sauce piled on top. I knocked the review down to 4 stars this time, because I remember the Guacamole being better! This trip is was a little bit flavorless, and didn't have the usual jalapenos on top which usually give it a nice kick. The staff from the hostess, to the bartenders, to the servers are always super friendly and helpful. They can get you in and out for a quick lunch, but also don't mind if you take your time and make a day or night of it! We will be back for happy hour many more times. As competition continues to move into DT Gilbert, Joyride continues to provide a great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove all the different style of tacos I get one of each by the time I leave love the down town atmosphere great service definitely will be back.\nSteak chicken and pork tacos\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the pleasure is dining at Joyride. We decided to take a bike ride into town for dinner. Love the open air restaurant. We chose 3 different types of tacos. The standard, the beef and the shrimp. The shrimp was my favorite the other were delicious. For desert we had the el Domingo. A unique dessert!! It was great. To top off our evening when we got to out bikes there was a coupon thanking us for riding in and we now can go back for 3 free tacos. What a great perk!! It was worth the 6 miles we rode and the extra perk made our night even better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI branched out of my normal stopping grounds to join a friend at his birthday dinner in Downtown Gilbert.  We dined at Joyride just a day after it opened, and there was quite the buzz which resulted in about a 20 minute wait, which was no big deal.  The interior is modern and bright, and very typical of what I have come to expect from the Upwards Project group.\n\nThe best dish of the night was the Joyride Guacamole, it was topped with little pieces of crispy manchengo cheese, which makes plain guacamole look super boring.  The chips were thick, some of my dining partners didn't care for them, but for thick chips I thought they were pretty good.  The salsa that they bring out was a smoky, thick red salsa, it reminded me of the salsa from Chevy's. They have some other salsas that you can order a la carte, but we stuck with the free stuff.\n\nFor our main dishes we got a variety of tacos and the nachos with carnitas.  I am a huge nacho fan, and I found these to be a bit underwhelming.  They were beautiful in appearance, but the cheese sauce that they put on them was pretty bland and they overloaded them with mushy, black beans.  The carnitas were decent, but I have had better.  The tacos were pretty hit and miss, the chicken tinga was the standout, the grilled fish was decent, but the carne asada was chewy and very lacking in flavor.  I am not sure if it was the cut of beef or the cooking, but either way, America's Taco Shop or even Filiberto's does carne asada better.\n\nI know another Joyride is in the works on Central Ave., so I will probably give it another try when they open, but it is not something I loved so much that I will take a field trip just to eat.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't buy into to the hype! Everything we tried was bad. I did the 3 tacos with a free side. I tried the carne asada, crispy fish, and carnitas taco with a side of pinto beans. My wife had the Beast burrito. The crispy fish was over cooked. The fish was dry and the batter coating was about 2 seconds shy of being burnt. The carne asada was not edible. It was literally nothing but 2 strips of fat and gristle. The carnitas taco was actually braised beef because they brought the wrong one. That was the only decent taco, however.  My wife had the same issue with fat and gristle in her burrito but she did have some edible pieces of meat in there.  The burrito was very wet and soggy, not appealing attributes of a burrito. Not only was the food bad, the tacos were very small for the price. You can go to almost any other restaurant and get a taco twice the size and twice the flavor for half the cost.  There was a comment card left with the bill so my wife filled it out and listed a few of the points listed above.  As we were leaving, my wife stopped by the restroom and I waited outside.  The manager then came out of the restaurant and confronted me with an almost hostile manner said, \"so you didn't like the food, huh?\"  I explained many of the reasons.  He made excuses and gave me 2 coupons for 3 free tacos each. I already tried half their taco menu and was not impressed with any of them so I doubt we will be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinus the long wait this place is great!  Super yummy food and great vibe!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe enjoyed our lunch here on the patio on a Sunday afternoon. The complimentary chips were SO tasty it convinced me to order the nachos...which are made with different (and in my opinion, not as good) chips. What!? Service was so-so, food was better than so-so but not great. There's a strong chance we'll come back but it's definitely not a top choice in Gilbert for Mexican, we find some of the other options much better for us.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat happy hour! We really enjoyed the tacos and margaritas. \n\nWe decided to sit out on their main patio. Glad we did because the atmosphere out there was just right. Not too loud, music in the background and misters felt nice and cool. Best of all was our server Shelby! We had a party of 9 and she was great! Excellent service and she was very friendly. We will definitely be back.   \n\nGilbert location\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped in after having lunch at Postino (next door) for a margarita. We have heard plenty from friends and our waitress and had to check it out. We walked in, ran into a couple friends and joined a table on the patio. We were then greated by the hostess, who \"greeted\" us with a \"so you guys just seat yourself then? I guess I will get you some menus\". She then came back warning us that \"next time you would be in big trouble for this\". Safe to say we abandoned ship and walked out. We returned to Postino and all is well. Welcomed with open arms and a drink prepared.\nSidenote: the manager came over to not only apologize for the insensitive hostess but also to offer free tacos for the terrible experience. She deserves the 2 stars. The hostess however, deserves the zero star review. She was rude and being someone that works a 100% costumer service position, she would be let go considering how we were treated. She isn't doing you any favors. Better luck next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe staff is friendly and made sure to triple check everything with our allergy issues! Big plus! Shelby, our waitress was awesome and Adrian, management, checked in and gave us a good laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride offers great open-air seating and some pretty good people-watching.  I popped in around noon on a Monday and the place was already pretty full. That might be because their happy hour starts at 11 AM.  I did not decline the $5 house margarita when my server offered it to me! It was served on the rocks and had just the right balance of sweet triple sec and tart fresh lime juice.  You can upgrade to Don Julio for $2 more, which I did on my second margarita just to see if I could tell the difference.  I could! Try conducting your own taste test if you're there for happy hour.  My drinks came with a basket of chips and fresh, chunky salsa that was on the mild side.\n\nThe tacos were packed with fillings, and very good, but didn't necessarily stand out from the all the other street tacos out there.  I chose the Standard, which featured chicken and avocado, and the carnitas, topped with avocado and tomatillo sauce.  You can get a free side dish if you order three tacos, but I found that two tacos was plenty to eat.   \n\nService was friendly and helpful.  Overall, I'd come back to Joyride to try some of their other tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe waited about 15 minutes for a table for 4 outside, not too terrible. Ambiance of the place is excellent.\n\nI LOVED the coconut margarita. I also tried the blood orange marg after seeing it mentioned in several reviews, but I thought it tasted a little soap-y. Thankfully, they were great about swapping it for another coconut one when I told them I wasn't a fan. My friends ordered the house margaritas + they were happy with theirs as well.\n\nTacos were hearty - no skipping on fillings - and we were happy with everything we ordered as far as flavor.\n\nMy one major complaint was the speed of service. We waited a LONG time in between any attention from our server. The manager (I think?) was much more attentive and ended up taking our order, among other things, when our server was missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic service! Staff was extremely attentive! Our waiter, Justin, was phenomenal. Love him! I would recommend to anyone looking for good drinks and better service!\n\n\n\n\n\nreally yummy food. I had their fish tacos and blood orange marg, and their street corn, and everything was solidly tasty. Nothing insanely different, but what was done, was done very well, and I actually liked it more than Taco Guild[ gasp.sorry TG], because it did not seem quite as greasy. \n\nWe ate outdoors, and it -can- get loud in the evenings as its always packed so be prepared, those of us less extroverted or with kiddos.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot much to say other than this place is super solid! Love their tacos and they have a great lunch special. Place gets crazy crowded for dinner and weekends, for good reason. Check this place out!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I met a couple friends for a late lunch today (Saturday).  We were able to order drinks on happy hour.  My wife got the skinny margarita and thought it was great.  The iced tea was great.  We split The Beast Burrito, Enchilada Style (green).  It was great.  We got a side of Mexican Corn, also great.  The service was very good, and so was the chips and salsa.  We will definitely be going back to try some tacos, and probably get the Beast again.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love joyride! The Mexican corn is AMAZING! You can get it on the Cobb or they will cut it off for you. I also love the veggie burros and veggie tacos. The atmosphere is great!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the food, but the take out service is HORRIBLE. Every time I call to order food, no one ever answers. I will call 15 times over an hour and still no one ever answers. I end up having to go in to the restaurant and order and wait, most of the times it's not even busy. Again... love the food, one of my favorites, but if your wanting efficient, quick take out.. this is not the place.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped in for lunch. Great atmosphere, very busy. We sat at the bar and were greeted promptly and given chips and salsa.\n\nI ordered the shrimp and crispy fish tacos. Hubby tried the carnitas tacos. My shrimp taco was very disappointing. Out of the 3 shrimp two had pieces of shell on them and one was burned to a crisp. I asked the bartender if it was customary to leave the shells on the shrimp. He said yes. I said are you  sure and I showed him the tail of one of the shrimp. He  took it to his manager who said that they would replace the taco. The next one was cooked correctly. Overall the food is pretty average nothing special. They do have happy hour price drinks until 5 PM so that was a nice bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir tacos seem more experimental than a good humble taco. Their guacamole is pretty bland too. I would come back for drinks only because they are pretty good. Overall it's a beautiful restaurant and its a nice hang out spot with a group of friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nService was good... seemed like we have 3 different servers though. I guess they share tips or something. Food was good... the only thing I didn't care for was my friend and I were brought refills of our ice tea and lemonade but were then charged for them. Usually places do free refills and that would have been fine had we been asked if we wanted another round but we weren't. We were just given the drinks so I would assume they were just refills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place gets 3 stars for cool ambiance and  eing very Photo worthy. The street that it's on is great for walking around as well. The food was good, but not at all authentic or filling, and overpriced. I left hungry after sharing a platter of tacos with 2 others and spent 2-3x what id expect at an authentic mexican taco spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally tried this place after eyeing it for months! I loved the drinks and the tacos are pretty good. We ordered carne asada,fish and shrimp tacos and my friend got the tamales plate that came with beans on the side and some veggies. The tacos were good a little pricey but other than that good! My friend said the beans were kind of bland and the veggies didn't really go with the plate but she enjoyed her tamales. So over all this place is good the drinks are awesome and the vibe is trendy and chill. I'll be going again for round 2 going to give it another try!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is such a cute place. I love how vibrant the colors are, it has such a happy vibe. I went on a Friday during lunch and it wasn't crazy busy which is a plus! Service was great and the staff were friendly!\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome place! The wait time is usually pretty long but definitely worth it (for those tacos!) and you can always buy a beer while you wait. Environment is great and the people work as a team there. Bartenders are cool as shit and always stay on top of their people! Always enjoy going back!\n\n\n\n\n\nRound 2 this time for dinner. Realizing all these local Gilbert restaurants do not take reservations is a huge turn off for us. 6:30, and it was a 45 minute wait for a party of 2 and honestly the managing of the table space is ridiculous...sitting 2 people in a huge booth for easily 6. Badly designed, bad seating management.\n\nThe food as I had reviewed before was really good, service was excellent. The $8 Citrus Vodka was so weak (not worth the calories). The basic margaritas were excellent. We had the Guacamole and Chips, 3 Taco platter with a side, and The Beast burritos w/no sauce.\n\nIf we came again for dinner I would either advice eating earlier (then I feel like an early bird \"snow bird\") or coming late late.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think as far as the food is concerned, Joyride deserves 5 stars. I had two of the carne asada tacos and one of the carnitas tacos. The carne asada tacos were among the best I've had. So tasty, such flavor, wow!  The carnitas taco was also super good. I ordered a side of the habanero salsa and while it was not as hot as I was hoping for, it had a lot of flavor to go along with the heat. Don't let the fact that it contains habanero peppers scare you off, it is more than doable, even for the chili challenged. Maybe they should make a ghost pepper salsa.  My wife ordered a pair of the baja fish tacos. I must admit, even though I'm usually not a seafood person, the bite I had was\nalso tasty. If you like horchata, do yourself a favor and try their \"spiked\" horchata with amaretto. It's really good and the fresh ground cinnamon on top was a nice touch.  Overall, I'm looking forward to hitting this place again. I wish I could say that I would sample more of their offerings but I'm not one that likes to \"go off the reservation\" once I find something I like.  Only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is because, we sat at the bar, and the staff was a lil slow in responding to empty drink glasses. Yes, a lil room for improvement but not a big deal. Give Joyride Taco Shop a shot!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat for happy hour!  Good beer prices for pitchers and world fabulous margaritas!  The margaritas were all good!  Tacos were also pretty special.  Cheese dip was \"so so.\"  Service was friendly and helpful.  All in all a good experience, and I'll be back!  Glad to have this gem in Gilbert!\n\n\n\n\n\nI saw there were 999 reviews so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to write the thousandth! \n\nThe beast burrito is amazing and so are the veggie tacos!\n\nBB's Rating: Tequilalicious\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening night! Great food! Great service! Great drinks! Billy and the staff are first rate. All in all, could not be more pleased! Michelle was a great waitress, as well!  Great stmosphere, as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey sell Mexican food and have Star Wars posters on the wall, so they're off to a good start with me.\n\nService is outstanding here. When I sat at the bar, they were very quick to keep my water glass full.\n\nTheir tacos, drinks, and ceviche are all tasty and well made. The carne asada taco is a little on the spicy side, so be ready for it.\n\nI have enjoyed both times here, and I'm sure I'll come back for more.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is probably the worst Mexican place I've been to, drinks are watered down even without ice, the salsa tastes like tomatoes no matter how spicy you get it, and overall a bad experience. The service was good but the food is so bad it's almost funny, if you still go here though, I suggest getting the Carne Asada taco despite my warnings. I suggest getting drunk before you order food here because then it won't matter what it tastes like, awful.\nAmbiance is good though.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive stars for exquisite customer service from all staff. Food is pretty great, too! Love the fish tacos and chicken tinga tacos. Salsa served with chips is very fresh and flavorful,  love that chips are thin and crisp,  not stale. There are a variety of sides..bomber beans and orange cucumber salad are faves.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen to Joyride Tacos a few times and haven't been disappointed yet! They have deals on tacos during lunch so be sure to ask about them, realized after we had started ordering a couple different tacos and she mentioned that there was a lunch deal so we opted for that! Also has a great atmosphere to meet up and hang with friends!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not just another taco house. In order to survive in this location, the food and atmosphere has to be spot on - and Joyride has done that! We were lucky enough to make it on an evening that was cool enough to sit outside. I enjoyed a couple of tacos and a couple of delicious margs and got to chat with some lovely friends. I'll be back!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was our second time here and still good! \n\nService was a little slow on a busy night. It seemed our server had a lot of tables and we didn't have anyone come up to us for 5-10min. She was nice other than that :) \n\nWe both got tacos and I got elotes on the side. The chips and salsa were good to start. The tacos were also good but my tortilla broke. It's also partially my fault, but I ordered a grilled fish taco but before she left the table I asked to switch to the crispy taco and I still got the grilled\n\nThe elotes were amazing and the drinks were pretty good too. Everything is reasonably priced for the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing tacos and margaritas! I had the chicken and carnitas street tacos and Strawberry Hibiscus margarita. The drinks were huge and only $5 between 11am-5pm! We came in around 2 in the afternoon and the place was packed (and now I know why)! That being said the service seemed to be a little slow, not sure if there was more of a rush than normal for that hour, but it was worth the wait!\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome salsa, strong drinks, tasty tacos, and a fun atmosphere. We tried 5 different types of tacos and I have nothing bad to say about any of them. I can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've only gone here for Taco Tuesdays, but despite the long wait, the food more than makes up for it! It's a nice hip joint with even better food. The service can be crappy but then again so will the next restaurant on a busy night.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a fan, too expensive and the food is below average.  Everyone raved about this place so we had to try it.  Fail, i'll never go back.  Staff wasn't exactly friendly or attentive either.  Not a great selection and if you really want good street tacos go to Lulu's for 1/2 the price\n\n\n\n\n\nFood is good, but the service is awful. Hostess was extremely rude and our server was incompetent. We got our drinks 10 minutes after we our food which took 30 minutes on its own on a slow night. After three times of asking and 20 minutes, we finally got our check which was incorrect. However, I was immediately contacted by the manager after posting this review. She was extremely friendly and apologetic which helped make up for the awful experience I originally had.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I'm gonna have to come back here for a happy hour.  I can't give it a five, because the tacos just didn't merit a five... that said, the chips and salsa were spot on, as well as the carne asada quesadilla.  I love the ambiance and decor, and the service was really good.  In regards to the tacos, the main factor for me is the tortilla.  You can tell they were made fresh, but they were dry and a little bland.  They were white corn, which was cool, but I think the massa needed a little something.  I guess it was just meh - and when your joint is named after something specific, you should try to knock that outta the park.  Will I go back?  Yeah, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy girlfriend and I have dined at Joyride on several occasions and have come to sincerely enjoy both the food and the unparalleled hospitality. The ambiance is very inviting and festive with a juxtaposition of eclectic and modern decor. Furthermore, the staff appears to help one another in their duties so that the flow of food and service is almost flawless, a true testament to their management. Having said that, I would also like to send a big thank you to the manager by the name of Zach who has repeatedly made our visits a truly amazing experience. Keep up the great work and we will see you again soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was scrumptious! I cant wait to be back in gilbert so i can experience their super tasty food. The drinks were decent, our whole party of 5 ordered the fresh pressed juice (agua frescas). I ordered the cucumber mint which was different, and kinda dangerous in that I couldn't even taste the vodka that i ordered it with! I would love to try another flavor next visit. The chips were good and salsa was fresh. The food was great! My friend ordered the fish tacos, i ordered the veggie burrito (which was a tad salty, but still very good) and my husband ordered the beef burrito. The portions were VERY generous. We went during happy hour, so 2 drinks and 2 burritos (for my husband and i) came out to $24! Super affordable! Cant wait to come back.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh YUM!  Love, love, love the crispy fish tacos.  Their chips and salsa, SUPER YUM! The cucumber salad.  The drinks . . . Well . . . I've never had a poor experience, all good!  Prices range from low to high.  I love hitting the happy hour - - you can get a $2 tacos!  Cheap!!  Highly recommend Joyride Taco House!  . . . cute and fun atmosphere too ;)\n\n\n\n\n\nmy visit here was NOT a joy ride.  As a matter of fact, of the three tacos i ordered, only one was decent.  i won't be back and i would not recommend this place to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place is a trendy and super yummy little place. It reminds me very much of LA and West Hollywood. This is not a good place for large groups... they can put a few tables together on the small patio outside but unless it is one of the few nice days of the year in Arizona, you won't be comfortable. Also, the wait can be really long. Ask them about an app you can download on your phone and you can put your name in at a restaurant and they are one of them. I forgot what it is called. The wait will very likely be 1-2 hours wait on Friday and Saturday nights. Brunch there is fun too though!\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat pricey for what you get. I do like aqua Fresca they serve. Service is ok and wait can be long.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my first time here... I absolutely love tacos. By far the best ones I've had yet:) and we can't forget our awesome server Tim! Thanks for the GREAT service!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had an amazing experience at Joyride, food was amazing and Catherine was the best server we've ever had! She was so friendly and informative and gave us such a wonderful experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nTrendy taco place in the heart of Gilbert downtown. We went there on Fri night at 8pm and had to wait 50mins before we got the table. While we waited we sipped on their margaritas and horchatas. I loved the cucumber Serrano pepper margarita, I was made just perfect for my taste. Almond horchata was too cinnamony though. The highlight of the food was their Mexican street corn. Fantabulous !!! Tacos were good but nothing extraordinary. Crispy fish taco and chicken Tinga were the best amongst the ones we tried. Must go place for their Mexican street corn and margaritas I would say.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis place was enjoyable.  The food was solid, the accommodated vegan request for my son.  The service for a Sunday afternoon was excellent.  The fish tacos were excellent.  We will be back, oh and the serve coke products!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere with my son.  Enjoyed the food while dining on their patio. Great place here in Gilbert ' s Heritage District.  Busy place even at 4:00 on a Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here three times and each time has been a joy! The service is pretty quick even during their busy times! I absolutely love the music they play. Although I could do without the flies that buzz by because of their open windows. I especially love their agua frescas! Fresh food and fun atmosphere! Come here if you're looking for something fun!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyride taco is a good place to go with friends family, kids. The food is always good they have nice cold beer. It's just a good place to go and chill.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo biggie, just the best street taco's north of the border. sides were great, service was great waiter was dry and slightly snobby. what else do you want. It was loud and super cool.  this place is a \"must go to\" for all of your out of down guests. They don't have a place like this in Des Moines Iowa.\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic spot to stop in for some tacos. Friendly staff, upbeat vibe, great drinks. Pretty much everything is good on the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to joyride a couple of times over the past few weeks. The tacos are all pretty tasty. My favorite is the shrimp taco. We also tried the nachos and the guacamole. Both were quite tasty. The ambience of this place is pretty great as well. Nice open space. It can get pretty loud and crowded, especially on the weekends. All in all I think joyride is tasty and a fun place to eat. I'd go back for sure and would recommend it to most.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time there and we will be back. I broke down and went out of my comfort zone and had the Crispy Fish Tacos.  They were amazing.  The guacamole was excellent.  The only disappointment was the margarita.  It was very weak and just not good.  Fish taco will bring me back, but the $9.00!margarita needs to be better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI come here at least once every two weeks & everything from the chips to the drinks are spectacular! My favorite drinks are the  Pineapple Mojito or Key Largo. Both are refreshing. The beast burrito with no sauce, chimichanga style is my absolute favorite along with the Mexican Street Corn! Definite place to try if you're in Old Town Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\n\nCame here for Taco Tuesday tonight with my parents. The ambiance and music were great! I ordered 2 crispy fish tacos and 1 standard taco. The crispy fish was my favorite. I also ordered my favorite margarita, the blood orange, I get that every time I come in. The service was great, I never had an empty water glass and the 2 hostesses that greeted us at the door were super funny, putting smiles on our faces before we even sat down!\n\n\n\n\n\nLOVE this place!! My friend and I come here ever Tuesday and it's always such a great time. Service is awesome, there's never a wait for seating, the food is bomb (seriously their crispy fish tacos are so good), and it's the chillest environment. We love Jessica SO much, she's seriously like the cutest person ever and she's such a great waitress  definitely 10/10 would recommend\n\n\n\n\n\nHad the pleasure of doing a bridal shower at this restaurant and loved it. Tacos were awesome!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was one of our favorite spots but today witch is a Friday during happy hour the food and service sucked my wife's quesdilla had almost no cheese the meet in my tacos were overcooked and dry along with avocados that were far from being ripe and on top of all this our drinks were left empty until the end when we payed then the bartender asked if we wanted a second round both my wife and I are in the service industry so it was sad to see the standards of one of our favorite spots get low\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall and causal. Tacos are good. They have a liquor license. It gives you the sense of a fast food place because it's so small but you get a server.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love the atmosphere and vibe of Joyride on Gilbert Road. My husband and I were starving and worked quite late Thursday evening - we were so excited that Joyride was open till 11pm! \n\nThe service was excellent! I felt like we were getting checked on non-stop! As we were starving, we ordered an appetizer and three tacos each with a side of habanero salsa: carnitas quesadilla, shrimp tacos, crispy fish tacos, a braised beef and a carne aside taco.\n\nThe carnitas quesadilla was absolutely delicious. It was very greasy, which made us a little uneasy at first, but after your first bite the rest is history. We destroyed the quesadilla and couldn't stop talking about it after. We even said it was our favorite, beyond the tacos!\n\nThe tacos were pretty good but definitely had some opportunities. The crispy fish had great flavor but the fish in both my taco and my husbands were the size of a golf ball. It was disappointing that the best taco was so tiny. The shrimp tacos were opposite, a good portion of shrimp (also very tasty). The braised beef and carne asada were also both good but not as flavorful as the fish and shrimp. \n\nIn the end, the quesadilla with a little bit of guac and habanero salsa is still blowing our minds.\n\n\n\n\n\nWent to Joyride for my first time, had excellent tacos and the Mexican street corn there is to die for! Amazing happy hour, they also do give you free chips and salsa... will definitely go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nI love The Beast burrito so much that I rarely stray from it but couldn't resist going for the lunch special which is choice of 2tacos and half size soup or salad for under $10. \n\nThe patio is perfect for an alfreso lunch on a sunny afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally got to try this place today.  We've attempted to come a couple of times but were deterred by the two hour long wait.  We went in today (a Saturday) at about 4:45, and there was no wait!  The tacos were really good.  We especially liked the fish taco and the braised beef taco.  The ahi taco was not impressive at all.  The guacamole was pretty good... not amazing but good.  Drinks were good.  Loved their salsa that comes when they seat you.  Very fresh!  I'd definitely go back, but I would never wait two hours for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to Joyride with a friend and we were blown away by the customer service and food. The mojito we had was delicious and the tacos were incredible. The crispy fish taco was my favorite. Go as soon as you can! It's right next door to Postino's East which is also outstanding. Both owned by same owner.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the music, food, service, and food...the food is amazing.  I would also suggest only four frescas...5 was too many ;).\n\n\n\n\n\nWaited while there were open tables, waited for our server. Chips and salsa ok. Main dishes terrible. Fish taco was garbage, shrimp taco - shrimp under cooked or rancid. Beast burrito not so good.  Everything else was not really edible... what is the draw? Service was weak. We left feeling fairly irritated. When you pay for a meal with your hard earned money a person deserves more. Get your act together Joyride!!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen wanting to try Joyride Taco for a while now so took the opportunity to have lunch there.  Bottom line, definitely go for drinks if you're in the area but skip the food.\n\nJoyride and all the other restaurants in downtown Gilbert aren't easy to get to.  Traffic in the area is congested and parking is hard to find... unless you park a block west of everything and the walk from that parking lot is full of dirt/mud/holes/barriers to hurdle.\n\nThe place was about 1/4 full at 1pm on a weekday.  Service was great except for the person who dealt with us most - our waitress.  We waited ten minutes before our drink order was taken, water was never refilled and she left our bill when we weren't even done ordering.  Much of our service was done by other people, though, and they were better than great and phenomenally professional (except for their hiring ability, apparently).\n\nThey brought free chips and salsa, and the salsa was really good.  I'm still not sure about the chips because they seemed house made but were thick like store bought.  The drinks were downright amazing, great beer selection the the cocktails were perfectly balanced and just this side of too strong.  Yes.  I thought the liquor prices were very good for the quality.\n\nMy biggest memory of Joyride was the food, which was so boring.  Everything lacked flavor.  The pork tacos were juicy but had no flavor even with a squeeze of lime, and their tortillas were too soft and just fell apart upon pick-up.  They desperately needed something like cotija or a flavorful crema...salt, even.  The pinto beans were a joke.  No flavor again - they actually tasted just like the Ranch Style Beans my mom used to serve from the black can.  I saw some green flecks that looked like jalapeno but the taste was not there.  This bland food might pass in Chicago but not here.  blecch\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wanted to love this place.\nService is slow... as in reeeeally slow and management needs to train better or staff better. How all the drinks come out of the bar including fountain for the entire place absolutely boggled our minds. \n\nWe had two taco platters and two burritos. Tacos were good... not great, but good. And the burritos had potential to be awesome but the ingredients were stacked short- length... so you got a mouthful of pico on one end and a mouthful of carne asada on the other... this needs to be fixed cause it makes for an unpleasant experience. \n\nUnfortunately we probably won't be back with backyard taco being so close now.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave been to Joyride a few times and the prior times was very good but the service was a little slow but always friendly. However, the food more than made up for it. Went it today  and something has gone wrong the service was terrible and the food was no where near as good in the past. Started with one staff member who was about normal for Joyride slow but nice. He passed us off to another right after we ordered and than we never saw her again until she brought the check. No drink refills our food was brought out in stages, frost two plates five min later another and than five after that the last two. The quality was not there tonight normally one of the best in Gilbert, not tonight. When one staff member came over she was really polite and asked how things were I let her know how things were going tonight and she apologized and said they have a team concept. Maybe if they stopped so much fist bumping and high fives they could do a better job taking care of the customer. We were sitting by the door and watched several parties leave because the host stand had no one there.\n\n\n\n\n\nI really enjoyed my taco experience here. A couple of friends and I rolled in for happy hour (weekdays 2-5 Pm) where certain tacos are just 2$ and margaritas are 5$. I had the chicken tinga, carne asada, and fish. The fish was the best by far but the carne asada was pretty good too. The customer service was also great here!! This place definitely had the nicest servers.  Also loved the location--downtown Gilbert.!! There's also an awesome parking lot right in the back so you don't have to worry about parallel parking. Get some tacos and then head down the street for some icecream!\n\n\n\n\n\nNice bar, good music, great tacos! Salsa with chips was good. Happy hr price of pitcher was great- dos Equis- was cold and mug was ice cold. I had the 3 fish taco selection of Baja grilled fish, ahi tuna, and crispy fish. They were all excellent - grilled probably the best. Orange cucumber salad ordered with tacos was a nice cool off to the spicy salsa. Total bill was $19 and well worth it. Very nice and upbeat atmosphere - but wondering about the open air design when summer rolls around in Gilbert with the cow dairies close by.... You know, flies may be a problem -but I guess they can always shut the windows. Nice addition to downtown Gilbert! I will definitely return to joyride!\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting from SOCal stopped by on the drive back home  because we LOVE Mexican food. Picked this place strictly for the aesthetics.... Love. The food matched the vibe, great. Our server KASE was wonderful, super fun & mellow but still got his job done. (Raise deserved) 10 outta 10 would visit again & recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nI admit this will be a somewhat petty review. But maybe it will induce change if management sees it !\nMy boyfriend and I are \"cilantro haters\" - we despise it. Fortunately, we can usually avoid it in most Mexican restaurants. We were thrilled to see that all of the tacos had a clear list of ingredients of which cilantro was listed to be in some, but not all. So naturally, we chose the tacos without cilantro. However, every single taco came garnished in cilantro !!!! Not to mention, the Baja fish tasted spoiled. The margaritas were delicious, but between the price of the tacos, the cilantro and the overall mediocre quality of food, we won't be going back.\n\n\n\n\n\nLively place on Taco Tuesday, a great open-air setting in the the north end of Historic Downtown Gilbert.   The family chose here, it was a bit drawn out of an experience the day after Xmas but that's to be expected anywhere.   During the wait for food we were fed chips and salsa, $1 per basket.   The tacos weren't as potent as some other taco specialty restaurants I have visited but they were pretty good for $2 a pop!   The Chicken Tinga was best.  The sound factor was moderate (louder music/crowds) but we managed to up the volume.  Lovely place to take your time and enjoy the afternoon\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't think there was anything special about the food, it's more about the atmosphere.  Off the bat got free chips n salsa.  I got 3 tacos and a side for about $14: chicken,  beef, fish with black beans.  Tacos were street taco size but they jammed it with plenty of meat.   Black beans tasted plain but probably made from scratch.   Also got the almond horchata which was good but didn't get a lot of it since they filled the glass with mostly ice.   For dessert, got the churro with chocolate... If you've never had the real churro from Madrid then it's pretty tasty.  Would I come here again?   Probably just to hang out with friends but not for the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tacos are small, but incredible! Carne Assad's better than braised beef but both really good.  Order the charred habanero salsa and mix with the regular, heat and SO good.  Margeritas are delicious too.  A definite repeat when in the Phoenix area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite places in downtown Gilbert. The ceviche and street corn are my favorite. I only knocked off a star because it is so busy all the time and they only take reservations for large parties. If you can't make a reservation odds are you're waiting at least 45 mins to an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved this place!!!!  Had the guacamole \"Joyride\" style.   Soooooooo yummy.  Tried the carne asada tacos and the crispy fish tacos.  Absolutely delicious.  Great service, friendly staff.  Only had to wait about ten minutes for a table for lunch.  I plan on going back to try the other taco options on the menu........\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great place!!  We went in Taco Tuesday for my parent anniversary and there was a bit of a wait, however the staff was more than accommodating.  When we sat the manger came over to ask if there was anything they could have done better as they seem to pride themselves in customer service. We ordered guacamole , multiple tacos, margaritas, quesadillas , churro and brownies- Both the food and drinks were great and the service outstanding. Can't wait to go back!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI love this place and come often, but the service is HORRIBLE. I understand it's happy hour and they get busy, yet that is no reason to give bad service. Every time I come, I see my server only once and I have to always ask another worker for a refill, more food, etc...I am a server and I have to deal with being busy, although I always give my best service. I expect be same when I go out to dinner. It's weird because it's only this location that gives the worst service! If you want a better experience I'd recommend the Joyride in PHX.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it is a burrito, taco or nachos everything served at Joyride is delicious and is made with the highest quality ingredients. Did I mention it is at an affordable price as well? It's been a 5 star experience all three times I've been here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was by far the best fish tacos I have ever had. I have been to a variety of places in Florida and Hawaii and California, with some killer fish tacos. These rank right up there. I thought only two tacos for sure I wont be full and will want more. I was pleasantly surprised on how full I was.  Their pitchers of beer were very reasonable 7 dollars for premium Mexican lager. OMG the churros were amazing! Must get for dessert no matter how full you are. Very fresh overall!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was not impressed but my husband liked it more.  We went for Cinco de Mayo so it was busy. I noticed their happy hour ends at five.  Am I the only one who thinks that is weird? The tacos were ok but over all not really worth the price.  Drinks were decent.  The decor and atmosphere were great but there were a large amount of flies.  I think there would have been less trouble with flies if we ate outside.  I might give it another try but maybe just a drink and app but there are better places nearby.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely not Gnarly, but it was ok. I like that we were able to get flour instead of corn tortillas. The one taco that was excellent was the crispy fish, but I wasn't crazy about the way too salty carne asada and chicken. The braised beef was supposed to be amazing according to our server but we were underwhelmed. Perhaps we are just jaded? After having the best tacos on the planet in Telluride Colorado I just don't know that anything can compare, darn it they have ruined it for us! \nI will say that joy ride has cool atmosphere and great music going for it. The tables are sorta close together so eavesdropping was a lot of fun! Hehe.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch great food for reasonable prices! I'd have to say the Mexican food really tastes authentic. Unfortunately, this place is always packed- which really wouldn't be a problem if the staff here were more organized. Every time I come I really hope for a better experience with my waiter each time, but instead I find myself looking for someone to make eye contact with me to place an order, ask a question, etc. It always kind of feels like my table has been forgotten. Like I said, such a shame because the food really is so good!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe originally waitress we had, Bailey, was amazing. She was bubbly, energetic, and connected very easily with us. After she brought out our apps, queso and guac (both AMAZING) we had a new waitress. Our new waitress was not the best, she made our whole table feel 'uneasy' for lack of better terms. We had our orders switched around, and out of the servers that brought us our tacos, they were barely able to tell what tacos were what. The only taco all of us enjoyed was the Crispy Fish taco, the rest were sub par. Drinks and apps were good, tacos were ok.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot your typical, overpriced downtown restaurant! Great tacos that are not even similar to others! I hate soft tacos and wasn't going to eat there for that reason, but they were fabulous! Love the chips and salsa! Sat outside and watched the nightlife. Very enjoyable place on the weekend at night!\n\n\n\n\n\nNever had bad service \nTacos have all been great.. Tried most \nMexican 75 is the best margarita \nHouse salsa is yummy\n\n\n\n\n\nOur server Jessica in Gilbert was amazing!! 5 stars!! ALSO, get the carne asada tacos. They're to die for\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been here twice now, with for family dinners. They have made family fun so memorable with their food and service.  I loved sitting out on the patio!\n\n\n\n\n\nRestaurants have 3 things they need to ensure in order to be successful: \n\nFirst is good food.  That's the most important obviously.  Even if you hate everything else about a place you may come back if the food is good.  The food at Joyride is good.  Everything that came our way was presented well, tasted great, and was ample in portions.\n\nSecond is to make sure you have a good time and are taken care of.  Primarily, this requires good servers and providing value for your money.  The service here was a delight.  We actually got forgotten about and not served for 10 minutes but the waitress was so friendly and enjoyable that it was easy to forgive.  Regarding the value, the daily happy hour until 5 on drinks makes it hard to complain about.  \n\nThe last thing you need, to me, to be successful as a restaurant is \"it.\"  You know \"it\" when you see it.  Joyride has \"it.\"  The atmosphere is enjoyable, the layout of the tables is comfortable, the patio is delightful, the colors are fun...everything just works.  \n\nThis was my first time at Joyride and I'm itching to go back already.  A great place.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeh.\n\nAverage gringo tacos for an above average price.\n\nMy crispy fish should have been good, and tasted ok, but the piece of fish was less than 2 inches by one inch in size, it was less than half the length of the small tortilla it came in.\n\nBraised beef taco was decent but small. Best of the 3.\n\nThe standard. If this is your standard, you need to raise the bar. Flavor profile was very weak, and tasted like something your roommate threw together from available refrigerator ingredients.\n\n\nSo because we ordered 3 overpriced undersized tacos, they are generous enough to give you a side for a $1. Second best call we made that night. The orange cucumber salad was very tasty.\n\nThis speaks volumes since the best thing about my taco meal was the veggies. My Arizona ancestors are rolling in their graves. You better be careful on Dias de los muertos you gringos!\n\n\nThank goodness for the dessert,  the Mo's definitely made a valiant effort in the 4th quarter of the meal. Too bad the score was too lopsided to begin with. The flavor profile was out of this world and my wife spent a solid hour afterwards looking for a knockoff recipe on the internet. \n\nWe might be back...........\nFor dessert\n\n\n\n\n\nStop in at Joyride during happy hour to enjoy a lively atmosphere and delicious street tacos. Pick one or three, they have a whole side of their menu dedicated to their well-know flavors. I went for the carne asada taco that was topped with a delicious red salsa and for my second choice I ordered the pulled chicken with a white creamy sauce that has a kick, mmm so good! Their homemade thick flour tortillas envelope the meat so well; I mean, you really can't go wrong for half-off street tacos during the middle of the day. Indulge yourself! They also bring you out homemade warm chips and salsa.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight in line with several other of the fabulous restaurants in downtown Gilbert, Joyride is a blast to eat at; it's fun, upbeat ambiance is great for larger parties, and I like the variety of types and styles of tacos it offers. Definitely worth it!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe actually really liked this place. The one thing I will say is that it is *always* packed, so prepare for a wait pretty much no matter what. That being said, the service here is absolutely *on point!* The food is pretty good... Not outstanding, but certainly not bad. Drinks are great and reasonably priced. Fun atmosphere. We have been back twice now, and the service/quality of food seems to be very consistent. Great place for day drinks. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place! Best service and amazing food! Everyone was super friendly and the atmosphere is great. You cant beat Happy Hour prices. $2.00 tacos and $5 margaritas! LipSense, Tacos and Margaritas for the win!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Mexican spot in Phoenix. Loved the complimentary chips and salsa that arrived piping hot as soon as I was seated. The salsa was amazing.\n\nGreat assortment of items on the menu, amd honestly, everything sounded delicious. I opted for the Beast in a bowl, which was Carne asada, beans, avocado, salsa and rice, along with a side order of veggies, which I was told was roasted tomatoes but when it got here, they were actually fried brussel sprouts. \n\nLoved the interior, the folks working behind the bar, and the food too of course.  Almost considered coming here the very next day for their $2 taco Tuesdays! Will have to wait for next time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will always love this place. It is hard to find a good veggie taco, believe it or not. The veggie tacos at joyride are amazing! They also have a fantastic drink selection and their margaritas are to die for! \nThe only downside is this place is always busy! Sometimes the wait is 35-40 minutes for 2 people. I try and sneak in the bar as much as possible to avoid the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy fianc and I had a great experience here!  I had the short rib taco and the crispy fish taco. The crispy fish taco was amazing!  Absolutely loved it!  I was not as excited about the short rib taco though. It was ok. I will come back just for the crispy fish!\n\nMy fianc had the three different kinds if ceviche and he loved it!  It was excellent!  He also ordered a blood orange margarita that was wonderful!  He did upgrade to top shelf tequila so I'm sure that made a difference. I don't normally get excited about margaritas, not my thing, but the blood orange one was delicious. I had a few sips, and I really liked it!!!\n\nWe sat out on the patio. Sun was going down and the misters were on, so it was cool enough. The atmosphere was nice. A bit loud but they play a good mix of music.\n\nWe will definitely go back!\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this place!! Went there the other day and the service was phenomenal! Tyrone was very attentive and was so friendly and willing to go the extra mile! Food was SO GOOD, I got the crispy fish tacos and they were filling! Love this place and highly recommend it!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been coming to joyride with my family for what seems to be years now. Every time we go it's always a pleasant experience. Food is excellent, services is wonderful. Chandler, manager, is always great. He never fails to come by and check on us. Great restaurant over all!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAh this place is so good! We came on Saturday and they had happy hour till 5 which was awesome. I tried the spicy margarita.. I think it was cucumber/habanero? or maybe it was poblano.. cant keep those peppers straight. But any who, it was delish! I also got the three taco plate.. one shrimp, one carne asada, and a fish taco. SO GOOD! Will definitely be back :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nI just had to write a review, because of my amazing experience! We went with a group of 8+ people, at a very busy time. The service was the most incredible I have ever seen! I could tell the staff is very happy and motivated. They were very friendly, attentive, accommodating, etc. They really worked as team. Our server was incredible to keep track of all of our orders, separate checks, requests, changing seats and numbers of people, and he did it all with energy and friendliness. And the $2.00 Carnitas Tacos were delicious, as were the Blood Orange and Prickly Pear Margaritas. The atmosphere is very festive and fun, too. Would highly recommend this place!\n\n\n\n\n\nVisited Joyride on a Friday night for date night. Was immediately impressed by the decor and vibe. Seconds after being seated we were brought iced waters and chips with salsa. The chips and salsa were great, the salsa had just the right amount of spice and was very fresh. \n\nWe were soon greeted by our server Justin, he was awesome. Made great drink recommendations including the pineapple mojito which I decided to go with, it was delicious! So refreshing! My fianc went with the horchata with captain morgan, another suggestion from Justin and he was not disappointed.\n\nFor our meal we decided to get an array of tacos. We literally loved every one we tried. Out favorites included the ahi tuna, crispy fish and shrimp. They really all were great tho. \n\nLastly, we ended the meal with the churros. They come with a chocolate dipping sauce however our server recommended getting the caramel sauce as well, good thing we did, the caramel was delicious. \n\nLong story short we will definitely be back and hope to see Justin again! Joyride was definitely a two thumbs up from us!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been huge fans of Joyride since they opened.  Today was disappointing.  They now charge for chip/salsa refills.  They added rice to the burritos as filler. Hoping they go back to what made it so good before the menu change last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent service, great recommendations, yummy tacos, and happy hour at noon.  They just need a queso dip and I'd give them 6 stars!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat vibe service was excellent my wife and I had Mexican street corn to start. And it was amazing, followed by happy hour tacos. At $2 each the tacos are good size and they are not skimpy on the meat which is always good. Drink specials are really good I had a house Margarita  also once again they aren't skimpy on the  tequila. Overall great place to chill I'll  definitely be back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeen this place on yelp and wanted to try something new in a new area since we barely came across downtown Gilbert today. (we are not from AZ) Cute little town area. We were greeted as we walked in, we sat outside in the open patio. The area they had for patio was cute with the hanging candles and lights.  Our waiter Clark, he was really nice and gave us great recommendations that we ended up trying. We ordered the Fila Ensalda (something like that) which is a really flavorful salad. I ordered the almond horchata with no booze, it was tasty. I also ordered the three tacos and get one side. The braised beef, shrimp , and Baja fish taco with the Mexican slaw as the side. \nIt's not authentic Mexican food but it is all very good food. I love the edgy atmosphere. \n\nRating: \nQuality: 5/5\nPresentation: 5/5\nService: 5/5 (came to check on us multiple times) \nCleanliness: 5/5 \n\nI do wish they would have more dessert choices though.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I need to mention the decor and the ambiance, which hit you as soon as you walk in the door.  It is obvious that a lot of love went into selecting each and every item that went into this restaurant.  My friend and I went for the first time on Sunday, expecting a wait.  We were pleasantly surprised that although relatively small, they have made excellent use of space.  There was both inside and outside seating  available, as well as some very comfy and cool looking bar stools.  We opted to sit at a table inside and we were not disappointed.  We were frequently acknowledged and addressed by a variety of staff members, checking in with us to make sure that we were ok.  Our waiter did a great job of recommending items from the menu, including a few tasty non-alcoholic drinks (**Note, these drinks, at 3.50 a pop are not cheap, and refills will cost you).  I had the Pineapple Agua Fresca and it was really good.  A little on the sweet side, though, and I probably wouldn't  order it again, unless I added alcohol to make it worthwhile (an additional $4.50 to add alcohol).  The chips and salsa are both freshly made.  In fact, our waiter apologized profusely that he could not bring chips to our table immediately because they were still being made.  As we perused the menu, I noted that tacos are sold a la carte.  All sounded delicious, and I opted for one short rib taco ($4) and my friend opted for 2 chicken tinga tacos ($3.50 each).  The waiter explained that a lot of people order 1 or 2 tacos at a time, and then reorder if they are still hungry.  I was definitely still hungry after just one taco, and I was dying to try the carnitas tacos ($3.50 each), but I also wanted to try one of the desserts--\"Mo's Definitely\" (homemade vanilla pudding, caramel, sliced bananas, salted pecans, and cookie crumbs).  Dessert was $6, so including the 1 taco that I had already eaten, as well as my non-alcoholic, non-refillable beverage, my bill came to almost $14.00.  Definitely not cheap for a \"small\" dinner that didn't include a side.  My advice to Joyride is to change the menu so that people can choose 2 tacos and include one of your sides and charge about $9.00-10.00.  It would seem like more of a meal and a deal that way.  The way the menu stands now is that you want 2 tacos plus rice and beans, you would be paying about $13.00 or $14.00.  The current menu offers only sides a la carte, ranging in price from $2.50 (rice) to $5 (corn).  I am giving Joy Ride 4 stars, just because I prefer a more \"all inclusive\" option when eating out, rather than just a pricier a la carte version.  The food is definitely tasty, and the service is great.  I would have given 4 1/2 stars if I could, because at the end of the meal, our waiter presented both my friend and me with a $10 gift card, good for our next visit.  He explained that these gift cards are given to first time customers.  Definitely a classy touch!   We will be back and we will bring our friends :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food and service are very good.  If the prices were about half of what they charge, I would give it 4 or 5 stars.  But, street tacos just shouldn't cost this much.  Last time there I had the chicken mole plate.  It was way too sweet for my taste.", "useful": 0.8442211055276382, "cool": 0.4355108877721943, "funny": 0.3542713567839196, "date": "2014-11-29 19:16:33"}}
